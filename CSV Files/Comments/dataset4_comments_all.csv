Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I read in a recent article on ""Orgasm"" in Discover magazine (or one of
the clones) that the vaginal lubricant produced during arousal in women
is simply 'filtered blood serum' ie, blood cells are removed. This would
probably not remove the virus. How this enters the mans body in

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate
into a discussion on AIDS transmission in Africa is just one of those
phenomenons of the USENET ...

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

My personal feeling is that Burton's recomendation for

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.
[Feedback, anyone?]

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to
the Press conference AND all three patients died in the week following.

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated
can either be disputed or criticized as misleading.
From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

This has been checked out by the CDC, and apparently there is no risk 
for transmission of HTLV-III via an insect vector.  I'm not sure of the
reference, but I think it's a recent issue of JAMA, in the ""Leads from the
MMWR"" section.
By the way, the virus is inactivated by high and low pH and by exposure to a
temperature of 56 C for ten minutes.  Most standard disinfectants (Lysol,
Clorox) and halogenated hand soaps will also inactivate the virus.

You are assuming that the person you entrust your care to has not misrepresented
his abilities as a healer.  The point is that a large amount of damage may be
done by someone who is misrepresenting him/herself to a small, but nonetheless
gullible segment of society.  Also remember that how gullible a potential
victim is depends on how fast a talker the ""healer"" in question is.  Although
the number of charlatans at large may be small, the potential damage that they
can cause is large, hence the requirement of licensure for the physician.
Remember - I'm not arguing for taking away the right of an INFORMED consumer
of health care to go to who they want, but I think the potential for abuse of
an UNINFORMED consumer makes licensure necessary.

	It is not illegal to seek medical care from a non-licensed ""healer"".
It is only illegal to offer to GIVE medical care without benefit of a license.
	The question I have is 'Why would you even WANT to entrust your broken
arm to an unlicensed practitioner?'  Without even being a board certified
Orthopedist, I can think of at least a dozen complications of a broken arm
that could cripple one for life or even kill. A license is just a form of
consumer protection, nothing more.

Sorry Craig, you missed my point.           
First---What about the Good Samaritan Law in regards to accidents. A person
        is offering to GIVE medical care. Is that person breaking the law?
        If so why do they do it and run the risk of lawsuits?
Second--It is not whether I WANT to, but WHY CAN'T I? I agree it is not a

In some instances, across the country, the unlicensed practice can be a
felony.  There have even been felonious instances by a licensed doctor.

The Good Samaritan Law was passed to prevent the increasingly common occurence
of normal people, say giving someone CPR, and then getting sued for breaking
a few ribs.  Based on that information, the logic fails.

comprehensive medical care.  But the fact that they had to pass the good
samaritan laws proved that at least some lawyers found it profitable to argue
that yes, they were breaking the law. (I don't agree, and I also believe in
altruism as a motive.)

The distinction between LICENSING and CERTIFICATION is a legal
one having little to do with the degree of preparation or skill.
A license gives you the right to do something that would be a crime
for the un-licenced to do.  A certification gives you the right to
do something and claim exceptional expertise at doing it when
others are allowed to do it, but are not allowed to
claim exceptional expertise at doing it.  There may also be
some limitations on the ability of the un-certificated to practice
in some situations.
In the area of medicine, to offer treatment without a licence
is a crime.  Under certification, it would not be a crime; though
taking the offer might be stupid ... :-)
While it is usually the case that both licensing and certification
require some formal training and/or examination; the distinction
between them rests on the penalty for practice when not blessed
by having the paper.  Physicians are licenced, not certified.

Perhaps this is a little off the subject, but have you ever heard
of anyone being convicted of practicing management without a license?

	""After about a year of follow-up [of radial keratotomy or
pinwheel surgery for near-sightedness], results of this operation
gave grounds for guarded optimism, with about 80% of patients
achieving nearly normal vision without glasses.  But as we stressed
then, what really counts is the long-term benefit of such surgery.
Last June, the results of a 4-year follow-up appeared in the
Archives of Ophthalmology, and they shift our position toward
guarded pessimism.  Between 1 and 4 years after the operation,
only 6% of the treated eyes retained the correction achieved by the
operation.  About 20% had shifted back toward nearsightedness,
and over 70% had tended to become more farsighted.  The drift
away from normal vision was regarded as significant (enough to
require correction with lenses) in about one-third of the patients.
Surgical techniques have changed since this group of operations
was performed.  Carbon-steel blades have been replaced by diamond
blades, and other aspects of diagnosis and treatment have presumably
been improved.  Even so, the basic message of the current study
is an important one:  good results after one year won't necessarily
last a lifetime.  Until we have hard facts about the long-term
results of these newer techniques, there is no reason to assume that
they will automatically be better.""

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange

One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now

The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of

black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

CDC after needle sticks in the US. Not one has yet developed AIDS, or AIDS-
related complex (ARC). Of those tested, none has tested Antibody Positive
for HTLV-3.
	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

	Whenever someone asks me how bad AIDS is, I respond, ""Well at least it
isn't as bad as Lassa Fever.""
	It begins with fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a sore throat (just
like a cold.)  However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces every
organ to close shop.
	Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseases
known to man.  It was first described in the early 70s by a group of Columbia
U. researchers.
	The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in a 
missionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.
After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospital
in Jos, where she died the next day.
	Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of the
disease, and a third was deathly ill.  She was flown to New York (prompting
several staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )
and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,
survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.
	Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to study 
additional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing the
epidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,
the first outbreak's final victim.
	(Source: Ten Diseases You Were Better Off Not Knowing About)
	(        G. Thomas, MD and L. Shreiner, MD _That's_Incurable_)
	Lassa Fever is not AIDS.
	However, in a final twist, Suramin, one of the antiviral drugs used
to treat Lassa fever, is currently undergoing clinical trials against the
AIDS virus.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.
I understand your position, but dissagree.  I assume you feel the same.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

	A mosquito is not so much like a hypodermic syringe injection as it is
like a needle-stick.  In the last four years, over 500 nurses, doctors, and

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

the obvious.  But, as of this point, the evidence that AIDS can be transmitted
by semen has been only circumstantial, although fairly strong (its spread by
sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.

still wondering to what rigors medical 'proof' must be subjected to.

The strength of any theory depends on how much of the observed
phenomena are explained by that theory.  In my >25 years of practicing
and teaching medicine I have seen no approach that explains the
observed, or gets the results, 1/4th as well as the holistic paradigm.
Eventually the truth will out.  This theory has been advanced several
times this century, by many prominent practitioners of medicine.
However, because we still didn't have the technology, or sufficiently
advanced knowledge and methods of communicating that knowledge, the
approaches tended to die with their practitioners.  I HAVE GREAT FAITH

AIDS is doing us a favor:  It is finally serious enough to get the
attention of the majority of the people.  You know, an organism is a
perfect microcosm of the population of a country:  Until anough of the
cells of your body shout for attention (a measure of how sick you
are), you are not likely to change what you are doing.  Until enough
of the people in this country (both lay and professional) hurt anough
to understand enough we will keep on in the same direction we have
been going.
Fortunately, the environment, both physical and psychological, is not
going to let us get away with the wrong direction much longer.
Legionaire's Disease was not a loud enough warning.  So, we got Toxic
Shock.  When that wasn't enough, we got Reye's Syndrome, Kawasaki

Syndrome-----AIDS--; we almost have the ""new disease of the month"".
ALL of these disorders are caused by the same basic problem I
described in net.med 817: AIDS IS PREVENTABLE.
We deserve better than we are presently getting from those we have
entrusted with the ""disease care system"" of this country.  It is about
time we start looking to the TRUE ""health care professionals""
presently trying to get the attention of the government and the
public.  They are the HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSN. and other Holistic
medical practitioners.  The longer it takes the more people will
suffer and the more it will cost.

raises some questions in the mind of a layman.  I will excerpt
his article.

Was it published? References, please?
BTW, what is the relation between the International Academy of
Preventive Medicine and main-stream M.D.-type medicine? (A
question for both Mr. (Dr?) Stoll and mainstream M.D.'s.
>In the beginning a few
>conventional researchers dared to suggest the truth but no one really
>liked the idea because ... it didn't fit the conventional

sentences.]
The idea, that AIDS requires a breakdown of the immune system
after prolonged stress, reminds me of the work of Hans Selye.
I had the impression he was respected by main-stream medicine.
If this is the case, is it consistent with supposing that
main-stream medicine pooh-poohed the Holists' view of AIDS?
>A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in

References, please?  AND critical treatment of these issues:
(a) What is your universal quantitative measurement of the
severity of a ""stress"", and how is this measurement justified?
(b) How did the West Germans measure the stresses that people
were subjected to 100 years ago, and how were these stresses
quantitatively compared to those of today?
Consider the environmental stresses that people faced 100
years ago, in comparison with those of today.  Driving is
stressful; but being limited to the speed of a horse and buggy
( ~ 4 miles per hour) must have been frustrating and therefore
stressful as well.  Which is better?  Well, which have you chosen
for yourself?
Then there were the nutritional stresses... no fresh green
veggies in winter, no refrigeration in summer, food preserved
by smoking or salting it... (too much salt in the diet, not to
mention carcinogens galore)... Somewhere I read once that in
the early 1800's, English bakers frequently put alum in their
bread to whiten it. (Cross reference discussion of aluminum
and Alzheimer's Disease.) A consequence was kidney/bladder
stones; Eton's infirmary had a ward for boys with bladder
stones.
This is getting far afield of AIDS; but it makes me feel
uncertain that, where holistic medicine is valid, it is all
that far from main-line M.D. medicine.

This posting has all the requisite elements of quackery: the familiar ""us""
vs. ""modernmedicalestablishment"" stance, the sweeping statements which
propose THE solution to difficult problems, and the perversion of
incomplete scientific evidence into a grand theory fully of fanciful
embellishments but truly lacking in any kind of scientific basis, let alone
scientific proof.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT PEOPLE WITH ""HEALTHY"" IMMUNE SYSTEMS
ARE SOMEHOW PROTECTED FROM CONTRACTING AIDS.  One might as well make the
same kind of tautological statement about disease in general, and it would
still lack any predictive value for the individual.  Yeah, AIDS is
preventable: to be 100% safe, don't have sex outside of a monogamous
relationship which has remained monogamous for the past 5 years.  The next
best thing is to avoid exchanging bodily fluids with strangers.  Any
""vigorously healthy"" or even ""average"" person would have to be out of his
mind to think that his presumably healthy immune system is immune to
getting AIDS: there are too many ""vigorously healthy"" people who are now
seriously ill or dead.  In many cases, it only took a single infected sex
partner.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

Study: AIDS Robs Cells Of ""Recognition"" Ability by Richard Saltus
===============================================
[Following close on the heels of another major discovery* :]
	The first step in the destruction of the immune system by the
AIDS virus is a preemptive attack on the ability of key immune cells
to recognize foreign organisms, a study shows.
	The virus acts with such precision that the immune system is 
utterly unable to mount a response, even though the capacity to
counterattack still exists, government researchers said.
	Thereafter, normal immune competence collapses and the victim
is left prey to a wide range of infections and tumors that cause the
syndrome's high mortality.
	The report in today's New England Journal of Medicine adds to
the growing evidence on how the AIDS virus - known as HTLV-III or LAV
[or ARV] - destroys the very defenses designed to disable it.
	The virus' name, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, signifies that it
attacks T cells, the white blood cells that orchestrate the complex
response of the immune system.  The T cells recruit other cells into
the fight, cause the release of certain antiinfection substances and
stimulate B cells to produce antibodies.
	AIDS victims have a drastically reduced force of ""helper"" T
cells, called T4, compared to the number of ""suppressor"" or T8 cells.
What has not been clear is whether the low number of T4 cells or some
inherent defect in the T4 cells is responsible for the progressive
failure of the immune system.
Resistance Tested
	Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases studied blood from 12 AIDS patients, challenging the immune
cells with substances that should cause the T4 cells to proliferate
rapidly.  In this test the T4 cells were not required to recognize a
foreign substance.  The cells responded normally, showing that they
retained the capacity to mount resistance to infection.
	Then the scientists mixed the blood with a foreign antigen,
a protein of the sort that the immune system would encounter should
the body be infected by an invading organism.
	This time there was no response.  To the researchers this
suggested that the T4 cells, which are equipped to distinguish what
is foreign from what is ""self,"" had lost that ability.
	Dr. H. Clifford Lane, who directed the research, said that the
infecting AIDS virus has been shown to attach itself to the T4 receptor,
a molecule on the surface of the T4 cell.  In effect, the virus blinds
the cell to foreign antigens.
	Lane said it was impossible to be certain whether the virus
uniformly knocks out the surface molecule on otherwise intact T4 cells,
or perhaps kills off a subpopulation of T4 cells that has the recognition
site.
	In any case, ""It's a very smart virus that came up with that way
of attacking the immune system,"" sad Lane.  He noted that these events 
occur early in the disease, leading to a cascade of later abnormalities as 
the immune system is devastated.
No New Therapies Implied
	Lane, in a telephone interview, said that the discovery does not
yet suggest any new therapies for the syndrome, but that it ""gives us a
better appreciation of how the AIDS virus is attacking and destroying the
immune system.""
	In an accompanying editorial, two Harvard scientists said that
increasing knowledge about the affinity of HTLV-III/LAV for the T4 cells
is helping to explain many of the puzzling aspects of the lethal syndrome
- and is raising some concerns.
	For one thing, said Drs. Richard S. Kalish and Stuart F. Schlossman,
when T4 cells multiply to fend off some other infection, they probably
become more vulnerable targets to infection by the AIDS virus.
	This may explain, they said, why exposure to the AIDS virus is less
likely to produce the syndrome in the absence of another infection, as in
people receiving tainted transfusions and health workers exposed to HTLV-III.
	However, the Harvard researchers also raised the possibility that,
in certain cases, the virus can infect not only T cells but also B cells.
""Such virally infected cells may function as a reservoir of virus,
potentially thwarting attempts at reconstitution of the immune system,""
they wrote.
	While there is still no effective treatment for AIDS, Schlossman
said in an interview, ""We've learned a great deal about the disease, and
the future is not so bleak as one might think.""
	*****************************************************
* In late June the discovery of a gene on HTLV-III which regulates
 the rate of growth of the virus was announced.  HTLV-III displays
 explosive growth at a rate up to 1,000 times as great as, eg, HTLV-I
 which is known to cause various cancers.  Manipulation of this gene
 suggests not only possibilities for eventual vaccine production but 
 even for the treatment of people already infected with the virus.
So, folks, it probably pays to keep up your general health, to avoid
other infections so as to deny the AIDS virus possible footholds in 
your bodies.

	For this, I looked in the AMA Drug Evaluations.  Two other places
that could be consulted are the PDR (Physician's Desk Reference) and
the Merck Index.  ALSO (and I was privately chastised for not mentioning
this more often),  call up your Doctor - for one, he has your history and
he knows your dosage.
	Thiazide-type diuretics block the reabsorbtion of Sodium, and the
water follows the Sodium out of the body.  They interfere with the 
production of dilute urine.
	Side effects: Pottasium may also be lost (see below). Also, the body
may respond to the loss of water, which has the effect of causing more
potassium to be lost, along with hydrogen ion and chloride ion. These have
certain effects of their own, which would be too technical for me to discuss.
	If you are worried about this, discuss the possibility of a 
Potassium sparing diuretic in addition to Thiazide. (I know nothing about
this particular facet, and I'm sure it's different for each patient.)

   > with untreated hypertensives. Is this only a rumor or is it true?
	The study you are referring to is MRFIT (Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial) and it was discussed in this newgroup several months
ago.  It is probably one of the most misrepresented studies of all time.
	It was set up like this: about 13,000 people with one of three
risks for heart disease (high BP, smoker, of High Cholesterol) were
placed in one of two groups: SI - Special Intervention, or UC - Usual
Care (i.e., ""You have high BP. Go see your doctor."")
	Both groups had lower mortality.  (R.J. Reynolds the tobacco maker
said it was because smoking didn't matter all that much -- the truth was
that even in UC, doctors told their patients to quit smoking, and they
did almost as often as those in the SI group.)  In fact, in many cases,
the UC group did as well as the SI group.  (This attests not so much to
the uselessness of the special intervention, as the quality of care
designated as 'Usual.')
As a whole, the Special Intervention did better than the usual care group.
(about 20-30% lower death rate)  However, in certain cases, the UC group 
did better than the SI group.  Or, put another way, the special group did worse.
	This one group of patients was, those with 1) high blood pressure,
AND 2) abnormal EKGs (indicative of heart muscle/electrical trouble).
	The reason was that this group was more likely to be put on diuretics,
which may lower serum POTASSIUM.  Abnormal potassium levels cause electrical
problems in nerves and muscles, and these people sufferred more heart attacks.
(Of course, this is now known because of MRFIT, and doctors look out for
this kind of thing.)
	Reference for this:
	Clinical Trials, Diuretics, and the Management of Mild Hypertension
	Marvin Moser, MD
	Archives of Internal Medicine -- Vol 144, April 1984, pp. 789-793.
	Note however, that MRFIT only concerned itself with moderate
hypertension - a pretreated diastole between 90 - 104. There is absolutely
no ambiguity concerning getting a higher blood pressure at least into that
range - lowering it is beneficial.

	I'm sure there is something much more substantial than this, but
many people who are overweight and hypertensive, see their blood pressure
drop to normal when they lose the weight.  That is indirect evidence that
nutrition plays a role. 
	There is supposedly some evidence that a diet high in fiber may 
help, possibly by changing the rate of absorbtion of ions from the gut.
However, I can provide no reference, and unless I can get confirmation (or
refutation) on this one, I'll have to consider it hearsay.
	I have also seen or heard about some suggestive but inconclusive
studies that not only HIGH Sodium, but also LOW Potassium and Calcium can
contribute to high BP. There was even some talk that Chloride -- the OTHER
ion in Salt (Sodium Chloride) may contribute, but Sodium is the biggie.

	Hypertension is found in all segments of the population. Blacks are
more prone than whites, males more than females. One sees it more in people
who are overweight, out-of-shape, who smoke, etc...
	As for the individual case, that is for you and your doctor to
work out.
	And if anyone on the net doesn't know their blood pressure, take
steps to get it taken.  Hypertension has no symptoms much of the time.

	You may have seen the article I posted a month ago, where researchers
evaluating biofeedback, meditation, and several other methods for lowering
blood pressure, ""lied"" to a control group, telling them that just taking
their own blood pressure several times a day would make it go down. They
were quite suprised when it actually did -- better than all the other
methods.  (Well, consider it another form of biofeedback.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

	HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen,  although they are a group
of proteins that occur on every cell in the body.  There are 4 groups -
HLA-A,B,C are found on every cell.  HLA-D is particularly prominent on
White Blood Cells.  There are hundreds of types of each letter - so many
in fact, that probably no two people on Earth (except identical twins)
have the same arrangement.  HLAs are also known as Transplantation antigens
-- they are the cause of Rejection following Heart/Kidney/etc. transplant.
	One of them -  HLA-D4 has been shown to react with the antibody to
the virus that presumably causes AIDS.  This is the first case of a true
False Positive with known cause.
	Therefore, people who carry the HLA-D4 gene will register a positive
result to the AIDS blood test, whether or not they have been exposed to the
AIDS virus.  However, it can be checked via other means.
	One explanation for the phenomenon is that the only cell line in
which HTLV-3 will grow carries the HLA-D4, and hence the antibody is raised
to a HLA-D4/HTLV-3 hybrid (also known as a virally-altered self) and then
will react with each component separately.

From American Medical News, May 3, 1985, published by the AMA
page 1, 35.
	Anti-AIDS drugs promising.
	Intensive research over the past year has produced at least six
drugs that show early promise in treating acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS).
	These drugs are significant because they attack the virus itself,
rather than merely treating the infections and malignancies associated with
the disease.  Five drugs are now being tested in AIDS patients, the sixth is
undergoing in-vitro study.
	Each of the agents acts by interfering with the replication of the
AIDS-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV.
[]
	The most promising drugs are:
1. Suramin. Commonly used to treat sleeping sickness. It is thought to block the
cytopathic effect of the virus.  Although it can produce severe toxicity in
Africans with parasitic disease, it appears well tolerated in US AIDS patients.
2. HPA-23.  This drug also is an inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
Tested at the Pastuer Institute in France, two of four AIDS patients show no
sign of virus one month after receiving the drug.
3. Phosponoformate.  MGH researchers have shown this drug has persistent
anti-viral action ... Two Swedish patients now are receiving the drug.
4. Ribavirin. This decade old drug, believed to act as a nucleotide analog,
appears to inhibit HTLV-III replication in cultured cells. It's exact 
mechanism action remains unknown.
5. Alpha Interferon.  This has previously been shown to be effective against
Herpes Zoster, CMV, and influenza.  It is furthest along in clinical testing.
Stage 2 and 3 trials are planned in Boston, Seattle, and New York.
6. Amsanycin. In CDC in-vitro trials, this drug reduces infective virus by
90%. It is the least studied of the anti-AIDS drugs, and its mechanism remains
unclear.
No single ""magic bullet"" drug stands out as the answer to the AIDS epidemic.
Because they act on different sites, it may be best to use them simultaneously
or in sequence. There could be an additive, even synergistic, effect.

It is a very very far cry from noting that nonoxynol-9 inactivates

an agent like this as an excuse to return to dangerous sex practices
are being deceived in the worst way, and it seems to me that the Mariposa

It seems to me that they are opening themselves up for a good lawsuit
(and maybe ?criminal charges?? - maybe there's lawyer on the net who can
tell us).

	AP) The Government has approved a sec-
	ond screening test for blood contam-
	inated by acquired immune deficiency
	syndrome, or AIDS, after laboratory
	results indicating it was the most sens-
	itive indicator of possible exposure to
	the disorder.
 	  Electro-Nucleonics Inc. of Fairfield,
	N.J., was awarded the second license by
	the FDA ....
About 2 months ago, I ran a series of four articles on HTLV-3, the virus
that most likely causes AIDS. I spoke of the screening test as highly
accurate, and then received mail and flames otherwise.
	Well, here is the source of the misunderstanding. There are several
tests - the most sensitive being the Western blot, which I was referring to.
(This was reasonable, since most Test-Positive results were to be redone
with Western blots before accepting the results.) It has an accuracy of
99.8% or so.
	The first licensed test had an accuracy of approx. 93%. Tests under
development range from 82-95.6%.  These all use a system called ELISA (for
Enzyme-linked Immuno- S? Assay) which is much easier to do than a Western
Blot (Incidentally, Western Blot is so-called, because the first person
to do ""blotting"" was E.M. Southern, so the blot was nick-named the
""Southern Blot"", and each new technique was given a different direction and
the name stuck.) ELISA involves add sample, add reagant, check color change.
	Anyway, this new test has an accuracy of 99.6% (4 false positives
in 1000 people)  which is not much worse than Westerns.
 
	AND, of course the usual disclaimer:  Although everyone with AIDS
has been shown to have antibody to HTLV-3, the reverse is not true.
The presence of antibody to HTLV-3 does not signify that a person has or
will get AIDS, but has merely been exposed to it or a cross-reacting virus.

Um, I've heard that a significant percentage of AIDS patients DO NOT
harbor HTLV-3 antibodies, and this bewildering state of affairs only
complicates the application of such tests.  Naturally, it isn't clear
in these cases whether the absence of antibodies reflects absence of
virus.  Does anyone have the original references?

Today in New York, the Scientists Institute for Public Information met
to gather all valid information on AIDS to give to the press and thus
insure the accuracy of news coverage & public knowledge. It was hoped that
such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But, as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused to attend, unable or unwilling to find time in his 
schedule.  The fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused
the creation of three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen:
HTLV-III by Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much research & testing.

I know of two theories on this  point.  One  seems  reasonable,  the  other
frighteningly paranoid.
Reasonable:
One of the primary vectors of AIDS is anal  intercourse.  This  is  because
the  lining  of  the  rectum isn't built for such treatment and can develop
tears which provide a  direct  path  to  the  bloodstream.  The  virus  (or
whatever) is carried and passed on in semen.
Paranoid:
It is rumored that AIDS may be  part  of  a  biological-warfare  experiment
being performed by our own military.  The rumor contends they are testing a
virus that attacks  only  people  with  certain  specific  body  chemistry.
Ultimate  goal: a bug that kills only Russians (for example).  Legionaire's
Disease is said to have been a prototype.
I would discount these as paranoid  ravings  but  for  the  fact  that  our
military  was actually caught doing something almost as cold-blooded in the
San Francisco Bay area not  so  long  ago.  They  deliberately  released  a
tailored mild flu virus in the Bay area to see how the winds would disperse
it, based on patterns of who  caught  the  flu.  Five  innocent,  unknowing
citizens DIED because of that experiment.  Since then, I don't put ANYTHING
past them.
(If any of this is true, I suppose I'll be quietly abducted,  interrogated,
and disposed of in the next week or so -- all for passing on cocktail party
conversation.  Who says it's 1985?)

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained
by the characteristics of the populations in which it occurs.

	Well, it was actually more than a single article, and there were 
similar articles in Science and Nature.  
The facts are:
	1. HTLV-3 (the Aids-Related Virus) is found primarily in blood, but
also in saliva and semen, and maybe other places that haven't been explored
yet.
	2. The rectum is a) bacteriologically speaking, an exceptionally dirty
place, and b) not designed for intercourse (wrong epithelium).
 
	However, Steve does have his point. Just because something makes sense
logically, doesn't mean it is correct. Also, just as a grammatical point, the
use of the word ""vector"" was wrong. The correct phrase should have been
""means of transmission.""

	The following is from the Jan 11, 1985 issue of JAMA (253/2),
""The Incidence Rate of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome in Selected
Populations""
	Incidence is defined as the number of new cases reported per
a given time, usually (and in this case) in years for a given population,
the higher the incidence, the higher the risk of getting a disease. For 
chronic diseases, it is usually steady. For epidemics, it tends to rise
dramatically (as in AIDS) and then fall (something that AIDS has yet to
do)
	Some of the data:
Annual Incidence: 	Year	cases		Rate/100,000
			1978	4		0.002
(in US, total pop.	1979    9		0.004	
age 5 and above)        1980	44		0.02
			1981	239		0.11
			1982	961		0.44
			1983	2501		1.20
			->5/84  3096		1.43
Note the nearly 1000 fold increase in incidence. This is clearly a disease in
the exponential stage.
	1.5/100,000 means 1 in 66,000 Americans has AIDS, or if they were
spread uniformly, that would be one for every sellout football game. (That
last example is of course, facetious, but illustrative)
	However, they are not spread uniformly, as seen below:
	Interpretation follows the data:
	Group			# cases		Incidence
 
	Single Men (US)		3,752           8.9
	SM in Manhattan		1,358	     	175.5
	SM in other NY boroughs   413		 37.6
	SM in SF		  473		204.5
	SM in LA		  308		 44.2
	IV Drug Users (US)	1,381		113.3
	IVDU in NY		  675           203.2
	IVDU in New Jersey	  188		269.0
	Haitians (US before 1978)  27		  1.8
	    (US after 1/1/78)	  192		 82.0
	Hemophiliacs (severe)	   33		298.5
		(mild)		    2		 43.2
	In female contacts of
	male IV drug users	   26             3.1
	Persons receiving blood
	Adult (> 10 units)	   25		  4.8
	Children(> 10 units)	    5		 22.5
	Children (10 or less)       5		  0.8
Comments:
	Most incidence data have trouble with the reporting of cases. In this
case, however, the number of cases is probably more accurate than the 
population estimate.
	This reason however, is the reason the incidence is for Single
Men, and not for Sexually Active Gay Men (which has been the usual
phrasing of the risk group) because it is very easy to tell if a man is
single, but much harder (and more controversial) to find out if he is gay,
or if he is sexually active (and how would you define that) In fact, 87% of
AIDS victims who are single men are gay or bisexual. (Same Source)
 
	For IV drug users, NJ may be higher because the estimate for NJ
only included heroin users, and for NY and USA included heroine and cocaine.
Also, IV drug users are usually less mobile than gays, so pockets may 
develope
	Note the numbers for Haitians. The very low number before '78
probably shows that the disease came to Haiti at approximately the same
time it came to the US.  It might have even spread there from the US.
Either way, it means that the island itself is not to blame.
	For hemophiliacs and blood donors, the data clearly suggests that
the disease is in fact spread by blood (though possibly not exclusively)
since the risk is related to the amount of blood that the patient receives.
	There is one other thing not visible from the above selected numbers.
Transmission from males to females is much more common than from females to
males. It may have something to do with females (tending to have less
partners, perhaps?) or it may actually say something about the mode of
transmission of the disease.	
	Robert Gallo of the NCI suggested that not just the virus but also
infected tissue was necessary for the most efficient transfer of the disease,
and sperm contains cellular matter, so it might follow.
	Of course, the disease can be spread without cells. Factor VIII
(for hemophiliacs) is cell-free and has 40 total cases.
	OK, this article is a little too long.
	Next time, more on the soon-to-be released blood test.
Oh, somebody wanted sources for my first article:
	Here they are, from Nature, Dec 20-27 1984

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	I have my own small addition, I tested positive for ""hepatitis""
last summer, but negative for A/B.  I eventually discovered I had
mononucleosis.  Thus non-A/B hepatitis can also be a secondary symptom
of some other disease.

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

Two points:
    1.  We don't know how many patients exposed to HTLV will

        years to find out.

	The actual protein involved is called CD4, and it occurs on so-called
T4 cells.
	Now for some immunology:
	Blood Cells are divided into Red and White Cells.
	White Cells are divided into B-Cells which make antibodies and
T-cells, which are for cellular immunity (and also are the things that
cause graft rejection.)
	T-cells are divided into several classes (1 - 8 so far) of which
T4 are one of the most important kind.
	T4 cells are helper cells - they make the rest of the immune system
work better.
	Note: in the absence of T4 cells, the AIDS virus, which is HTLV-3
(also called LAV) cannot grow. Immunosuppressed people shouldn't be able to
get AIDS. Experimentally, immunosuppressed cats don't get FAIDS (Feline AIDS)
One of the reasons, therefore that Gays, Drug Users, etc., are more suseptible
to AIDS (Besides the fact that they are exposed to the virus more often) is
that they tend to get other infections more often which activate the immune
system and make more T4 cells for the AIDS virus to grow on. (Talk about
Molecular Catch-22s)
	I'm a MD/PhD candidate in Immunology and recently heard Robert Gallo
give a very well-organized seminar, so I'll followup with another posting
on the history of AIDS.

to a potential/current sex partner is unnecessary.
I don't know what my answer is to any of the questions so far.  I do know

and we hadn't heard much of safe-sex at the time.
This question is important to me since I have the oppotunity to participate

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual

*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.","FhgStjPmxOgJ",19,1986-03-21,-10,11

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,
there is no way currently to get rid of the damn thing.","H75UzjNUdRYJ",19,1986-03-21,-9,26

confidentiality, they ask men who are concerned about HTLV-III exposure
and are considering being tested:
	""What would you do differently, if you knew?""
They argued pretty persuasively against being tested, for the following
reasons:
1.) a negative test is no license for increased sexual activity
    (to be meaningful, you'd have to be tested weeks to months after
    each new sexual partner, when in the meantime, you could be spreading
    the virus.)  In essence, every gay man should be behaving as if he were
    exposed, regardless of the test results.
2.) Denial (as in not knowing one's HTLV-III exposure) can be thought of as
    having some positive effects.  Too often, they have seen people who went
    to be tested out of curiosity, who, after hearing that they test positive,
    end up with severe emotional stress, certainly reducing their quality of
    life.

There certainly are political concerns against taking it, most of which are

But for me, the deciding factor was the consequences.  I asked my doctor
what his advice is to patients who test negative (no HTLV-III virus), and
he said that he recommends following the safe sex guidelines and reducing
the number of sex partners, to avoid exposure to the virus.  Then I asked
what his advice is to patients with the virus, and his advice was the same,
to avoid exposing their partners.
The ""relief"" I might feel from a negative test result would in no way

I have some Gay friends who have been arrested in Toronto Ontario.  When word
got around that they were Gay, they were subject to a lot of violence in
prison -- something to the order of -- ``he's gay, so it is fine to gang rape
him -- after all, he loves this stuff.''  Solitary confinement sucks, but I
don't think that this is a lame excuse.

Why is quarantining someone with the ability to transmit a fatal disease
the ability of someone being able to transmit a fatal disease a lame
excuse?  I keep reading things that say, in effect ""why do anything about
people infected with the virus since the they may not develop aids?""  The
point that is missed with this idiocy is that most people are not opposed to
individuals walking around with fatal conditions, but rather to individuals
walking around who can give them a fatal condition.  I know of no one who
thinks heart patients, emphysema patients, etc. should be quarantined, even
though the may drop dead at any moment, because their afflictions cannot harm
others.  Nevertheless, many states restrict people with active tuberculosis
from holding certain jobs, and restrict people with untreated epilepsy from
perfroming certain task, because their afflictions can harm other people.
If AIDS was not contagious, or if people with full blown AIDS were not
contagious, society would probably be a lot less concerned about people
with AIDS walking about.  But the odds are that anyone who tests positive
to HTLVIII is infectious, and possibly more infectious than individuals
who are symptomatic.  Therefore whether an infected individual ever actually
comes down with AIDS or ARC is beside the point to society at large. 
Studies in some prisons have shown that much less than half of the inmates
have been exposed to the virus.  Although it may be unfair to make someone
who sells heroin spend a few years (or maybe months, giving sentencing in this
country) alone because he has been infected, it doesn't seem as unfair as
sentencing another inmate to death when he is gang raped by one or more
infected individuals.  When you commit crimes one of the chances you take is
that you will be deprived of some basic freedoms - one of those freedoms being
the ability to murder by infecting other people with your fatal diseases.

Although some people might claim that all homosexuals, whether criminal or
not, are equal, I am astonished to see someone purporting to be pro-homosexual
make this claim.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to sort out
people for death and slave labor.  Admittedly the ACLU and their ilk would
like the rest of us to believe that we are either on the verge of, or
have slipped into, the horrors of fascism in this country, but we are 
thankfully a long way from it.   It is an insult to those who died under
the Nazis to equate their ordeals with the inability of convicted criminals
to dress as they want.

Garbage.  There is *no* proof or evidence to show that anyone who tests HTLV3
positive is infectious.  There is evidence to suggest that those who test HTLV3
postive have between a 10 and 15% chance of being diagnosed with one or more
of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS within 5 years after
testing HTLV3 positive.  Pretty low odds!  This *fact* is not beside the
point.  It has further been shown that HTLV3 is *very* difficult to transmit,
and that it probably requires multiple exposure to get the retrovirus.

What crime has someone who is infected with HTLV3 committed?  If you mean to 
imply that all HTLV3 exposed people are homosexual, and that homosexuality
is a crime, you are wrong.  Not all HTLV3-positive people are homosexual
men.  Fact.  And consensual acts between adults are not illegal in many states,
and for that matter, a lot of what goes on between heteros is statute illegal.
That you think that anyone who has committed a crime is to be deprived of the
basic right to life, you are one sick puppy.

Wrong.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to single out homosexuals
in concentration camps, just as they used stars of david to identify Jews and
cirles to identify ""intellectuals.""  Everyone was at risk for death in the
concentration camps.

We're not talking about the right of people to dress in their Calvin's in
prison.  We're talking about the singling out people for the soul reason
that they may be infectious, they may be homosexual, they may be diagnosed
with AIDS/ARC.  There is nothing to support any of those contentions in
being diagnosed HTLV3 positive.  There is no relationship between HTLV3
and one's sexuality, gender, race, color, creed, religion, eye color,
national origin, IQ, or food preferences.  NONE.  Viruses don't discriminate,
people do.","uaAqzE5LvNMJ",11,1986-02-13,-41,29

I just saw Istvan Szabo's film ""Colonel Redl"" (German, subtitles),
starring Klaus Maria Brandauer (""Mephisto"") in the title role.
Albert Redl was a talented & ambitious head of military intelligence 
in the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the final years of the Hapsburg
dynasty preceding the outbreak of WW1, who died amidst a scandal
under mysterious circumstances.  The film portrays Redl as homosexual,
originally idealistic but increasingly corrupted, and ultimately
scapegoated by the Archduke Rudolph to rally flagging morale in the
arm; Redl is forced into suicide when he refuses to cooperate in his own
frame-up.  Like the earlier Szabo/Brandauer collaboration ""Mephisto"",
about an ambitious & amoral actor who consorts with Nazis and ends up
their victim, the direction and acting are breathtaking and brilliant:
Brandauer's simply amazing, once again.  The recreation of turn-of-the-
century Vienna & Galicia is near-perfect.  The movie is ""loosely based""
on historical events and John Osborne's play, ""A Patriot For Me.""  The
film must be rich with allusions to the present (Hungary continues to
slyly but carefully snip more of the ties binding them to the USSR) but
I'm not up on events well enough to interpret them.  Don't miss this
film!
I just finished reading Margaret Yourcenar's ""The Abyss,"" a meticulously
researched and elegantly written historical novel about 16th century
Europe.  The book, in the writing from 1921 to 1964 (Yourcenar is 82),
is a kind of intellectual thriller, its main character, Zeno, a homosexual
Flemish alchemist, physician, philosopher & free-thinker (modeled on real
near-contemporaries such as da Vinci, Paracelsus, Giordano Bruno, Tomasso
Campanella, Erasmus, Ambroise Pare, Cardan, etc.) crisscrossing the Flanders, 
France, Austria & Italy of the reformation, counter-reformation and wars of 
religion, staying one step ahead of the Inquisition and Protestant zealots 
while scorning most of humankind and the follies and brutality of his age.
	One of this month's NYReviews has a long article on Yourcenar's
writing.  The reviewer considers Yourcenar the greatest women writer of 
the century (I think this is excessive) and wonders if sexism has kept
her from winning the Nobel Prize, but also points out that most of the
the protagonists/heroes in Yourcenar's fiction are somewhat misanthropic
homosexual men, subtle, acute, & severe, while her female characters are
nearly all unsympathetic, often mindless or foolish.
	The book features a lesbian Calvinist couple.
	A gay historical note: in her afterword on the composition of the
novel, Yourcenar claims that Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohen-
heim), Campanella, Etienne Dolet (a famous atheistic Parisian printer who
was burned at the stake), & other alchemists/free-thinkers of the time
were homosexual, suspected of being such, and there are records of their
""companions.""  I remember reading somewhere a claim that the Dutch humanist 
Erasmus was gay, and even possibly the philosopher Bruno.  There are also
other striking similarities: eg, a number of these figures, like Zeno,
were illegitimate (da Vinci, Erasmus).
Louis Crompton's ""Byron & Greek Love: Homophobia in 19th Century England""
got a glowing review from Bernard Knox in NYR a few issues ago, a surprise
considering the Review's two-faced handling of gay issues.  Crompton's
book must be one of the best pieces of scholarship on a gay topic, in a
class with works by Kenneth Dover (""Greek Homosexuality"") and John Boswell
(""Christianity, Social Tolerance & Homosexuality).  It uses a close inves-
tigation of the poet Byron's bisexuality to illuminate homophobia in
Georgian (early 19th century) England and to reveal an incredible corpus
of unpublished writings on homosexuality by Jeremy Bentham, jurist, poli-
tical reformer & the founder of utilitarianism.  Bentham wrote nearly
500 pages on topics such as homophobia, sexuality, and homosexuality
from legal, historical, scriptural, aesthetic, biological, & political
points of view, publishing anonymously a reinterpretation of the New
Testament ""Not Paul But Jesus"", and anticipating many of the issues, 
perceptions and arguments of the gay liberation movement of the late 20th
century.  Dating from as early as 1784, these writings now make Bentham
history's first gay activist.
	I have only one bone to pick:  Crompton is on opposite sides from
Boswell of a split in gay scholarship (to me, a rather silly, futile and
fractious quarrel that won't produce anything).  Crompton espouses a
""social constructionist"" view of gay history: it asserts that the category
""gay"" or even ""homosexual"" and its associated behaviors and attitudes are
historically new, a product of changed group consciousness, so that
same-sex sexuality prior to the latter 19th (maybe now late-18th?)
century is different in kind from what we understand as ""gay"" or
""homosexual"" (or ""heterosexual"", for that matter).  I like this view 
for its intellectual audacity, but I think it's patently false if applied
literally to the past (& incredibly arrogant & ethno/historicocentric
as well).  My one criticism of the book is that Crompton thus fails
to cite Boswell's work at all, and he takes traditional homophobic
interpretations (of scripture, law, & literature) at face value, seemingly
refusing to consider Boswell's counterevidence/arguments out of mere parti-
sanship.
	I urge all netters with any interest in history, gay topics, or
simply fine scholarship, to read Crompton's book.

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

       and  cold  war within the gay community""	by Marshall K. Kirk
       and ""Erastes Pill"", in ""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
       ""Amongst	ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank	and
       power  in the gay world,	and the	opposing sides are drawn in
       terms of	self-identification and	public appearance.  What is
       worse,  this  struggle for hierarchy will continue unless we
       abandon some of the dogmas of the gay establishment. ...
       ""The shared impressions and arguments  put  forth  here	are
       tentative,  our generalizations are riddled with	exceptions,
       and we imagine that some	of our speculations will be  proved
       incorrect.
       ""First, consider	two modes of self-perception. ...  Many	gay
       men  like  to  identify themselves either as 'straight gays'
       (R-types) or not	(Q-types).
       R-types view themselves
       ""Rs like	to think that they pass	as straights on	the street.
       They  value  highly their acceptance in general society,	and
       many are	careful	to  sustain  friendships  in  the  straight
       community.   Rs	are  proud  of	their manly appearance,	and
       typically rankle	over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
       gay  males.   They  may	be  receptive to, or even obsessive
       about,  social  conventions  and	 norms	based	on   gender
       distinction;  ...   completely  homosexual Rs may persist in
       describing themselves as	'bisexual.'
       ""The one	thread connecting the  childhoods  of  Rs  we  have
       interviewed  is	peer  acceptability.  By and large, Rs were
       kids who, for one reason	 or  another,  could  conform  with
       ease,  and  so did. ...	Young Rs, it seems, were only dimly
       aware of	 their	need  for  the	rewards	 of  acceptability,
       effortlessly   achieved.	   So  the  arrival  of	 adolescent
       sexuality sent a	stunning shock	through	 well-adjusted	Rs.
       ...   Many  boys	 ignored and disguised this discovery until
       they could come to terms	with it.  In the meantime,  teenage
       Rs  struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer
       image.  Even as they grew up to enjoy sex with other boys on
       the  sly, conformism in all other aspects of demeanor became
       the self-exacted	quid pro quo.
       Q-types view themselves
       ""... these gays often are not, and feel	that  they  do	not
       wish  to	 be, 'straight-acting and appearing.' The extreme Q
       is a homosexual on display.   (He  may  not  always  be	one
       display ... [e.g.] in the presence of family and	employers.)
       On the street, he may assume any	one of the  several  public
       personas	 most  familiar	 to the	straight world:	the pomaded
       and permed 'fem', the titanic leather  master,  the  clipped
       clone,  the  GQ	hyperboy, and others. ...  Qs are outwardly
       gayified; they have bought into strict outgroup	stereotypes
       which, whether screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
       constitute  a  burlesque	 of  gender  roles.   Qs  think	 of
       themselves  as visible gays, and	tend to	make such a profile
       central to their	ego structure. ...
       ""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,  and  Qs	are
       perhaps more likely than	Rs to be drawn toward the asylum of
       gay ghettos in urban centers. ...
       ""Whereas	Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and	 so
       did, many Qs felt that, for whatever reasons, they could	not
       conform during their youth, and so did not.   Those  reasons
       might  include passivity, effeminacy, homeliness, remarkable
       prettiness, lack	of athletic  skill,  or	 almost	 any  other
       cause   for   unpopularity  among  male	youth.	 At  first,
       evidently, many Qs were unhappy loners  who  salvaged  their
       self-esteem by making a lodestar	virtue out of individualism
       rather than peer	acceptance.  But  non-conformity  engenders
       anti-conformism.	  So  some  Qs	went further and acquired a
       taste for  outrageousness,  actively  calculating  shock	 to
       others  in  order to reinforce their social status as rebels
       with a cause. ...
       ""As the years go	by, and	they learn that	they are not alone,
       Qs  adopt zealously the visible uniforms	and credos of their
       supporting outgroups. ...  Surveys have shown that, for many
       Qs,  camp  behavior  is	a  passing phase of overt defiance,
       toned down in later years.
       ""When those gays	who boast R-status meet	 those	who  defend
       Q-status, there can be trouble.	First, let's look at things
       for the viewpoint of the	 R.   For  one	thing,	the  sexual
       objects	of  Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs, for the most part
       are scorned. ...	 It is the 'fem' [from among the variety of
       Q-type  personas]  who bears the	brunt of the invective from
       Rs. ...
       ""[Gay] bars are often regarded by  Rs  as  the  bastions	 of
       self-segregated	Qs - branded as	twinkie	bars, leather bars,
       etc. - and so may be viewed with	distaste. ...
       ""We should mention at this point	that those Rs who shun	the
       bars  find it more difficult to lead satisfactory sex lives.
       They have trouble meeting other Rs because,  unlike  visible
       Qs,  out	 in  the  straight  world most Rs have banished	any
       tell-tale signals of  homosexuality  from  their	 conformist
       uniforms	and are	wary of	mistaken self-exposures. ...
       ""To make	sexual matters still more difficult  for  many	Rs,
       they  face two more unique dilemmas. ...	 First,	... a Q	may
       be drawn	to,  and  satisfied  by,  a  relationship  with	 an
       acceptably  masculine  R.   But what of the classic R-type -
       the 'all-American boy' whose only felt  shortcoming  is	his
       sexual  preference?   For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual
       object possessing the one feature  he  feels  he	 lacks	and
       wishes  to  capture - may very well be the straight boy,	who
       is, by definition, unattainable.	...
       ""The second sexual dilemma faced	by Rs involves	the  ritual
       of  sex-play  itself.   For  at	least  some  Rs,  it seems,
       masculine role performance is the  most	thrilling  part	 of
       sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened in homosexual practices
       such as passive anal sex	or active fellatio. ...
       ""But even if the	 R  is	contentedly  'out'  to	family	and
       friends,	 and  self-exposure  is	 not an	issue, he may still
       dislike Qs for two related reasons.
       ""First, because the R has typically conformed with  ease	 to
       the  mainstream,	 the  exaggerated  outgroup  displays of Qs
       simply baffle him.  Why would any person	choose to draw such
       public ridicule and abuse, he wonders? ...  'I don't see	why
       they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
       [we  interviewed].   'It	 obviously looks phony and fools no
       one.' At	best, then, many Rs come to view Qs  the  way  that
       many  straights view homosexuals	en bloc, as somehow foolish
       and trivial, a nationality of sterile cuckoos. ...
       ""Second,	Qs do more than	baffle Rs - they also  irritate	 Rs
       terribly,  to  a	 degree	that more detached straights cannot
       understand.  Many Rs plainly resent  being  identified  with
       the  Qs,	and blame them for the weird profile of	homosexuals
       as a whole. ...
       ""Like most gay males, it	seems,	even  exotic  Qs  hear	the
       siren  call  of	the rutting R.	And so relations between Qs
       and Rs grow still more tense.
       ""It is our impression that, for both Rs and  Qs,	 archetypal
       Rs  the	'idols	of  the	 tribe.'  It is	the R whose natural
       masculine grace tops  the  overall  hierarchy  of  desirable
       traits	in  the	 fierce	 gay  competition  of  good  looks.
       Handsome	Rs often sense this pecking order, and feeds  their
       egos  while  hardening  their disdain for Qs, especially	the
       effeminate ones.	...
       ""Many Qs	may learn from necessity to refocus their libido on
       fellow Qs. ...
       ""For it is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after	the
       R  as  sexual object, they may also resent and reject him as
       social  companion!   There  are	several	 reasons  for  this
       rejections. 'Sour grapes' is an understandable reaction from
       those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
       have  defensively  fashioned  a	lifestyle  out	of peculiar
       individualism are bound to resent (and perhaps envy  just  a
       little)	those  gays  who can and do successfully conform to
       straight	standards. ...	There is more to  Q/R  estrangement
       than just these problems.
       ""For one	thing, if the handsome all-American straight boy is
       the  ultimate  sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-
       type homosexual must appear as a	ghostly	mock-up	of the real
       thing. ...
       ""Further, Rs are	 still	more  upsetting	 to  those  Qs	who
       believe	that  'butch'  behavior	is just	an unnatural put-on
       for gays. ...  Just as the anti-conformity of Qs	baffles	Rs,
       the ease	with which Rs conform to the mainstream	may be hard
       for Qs to understand. ...  Hence, Qs  may  misinterpret	the
       Rs' ingrained disinclination to gayified	behavior, and label
       it homophobia. ...
       ""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type  persona
       as the 'true' gay type, and hence feel like outsiders within
       their own outgroup. ...
       ""How do these tensions between Rs and Qs	affect	the  social
       structures,  political institutions, and	activist success of
       the gay community?  ...	 Those	who  could  not	 hide  have
       instead	turned	to make	their stand against oppression,	and
       Qs have risen to	political leadership and brotherhood in	the
       activist	 movement across America.  This	is to their credit.
       Extreme Qs, as a	group, may rate	below Rs on the	sociosexual
       hierarchy,  but they can	and do rank above them on the scale
       of political power in the gay world.
       ""In  the	 meantime,  reticent  Rs,  who	benefit	 from	the
       sacrifices  of  Qs and yet carp about their flamboyant image
       in the straight world, have been	able to	have it	both  ways:
       they  achieve  personal	acceptability in the right straight
       world of	today, while relishing the progress  toward  social
       flexibility  made on their behalf for tomorrow.	But because
       Rs do not choose	to play	the activist game in great numbers,
       they  lose their	ability, as a group, to	influence the rules
       of that game.
       ""Although the point is hard  to	prove  with  certainty,	 we
       suspect that it is mainly Qs who	organize the gay community,
       set its norms, and decide which of  its	collective  efforts
       are  PC	['politically  correct'].  PC initiatives are those
       which the gay leadership	and press deem to be good  for	the
       gay  community  as  a whole.  And the mobilization of the R-
       type subgroup, it turns out,  is	 definitely  not  PC  -	 at
       least, not in Boston.  Let us give you an example.
       ""Several	years ago, a handful of	 young	men  in	 that  city
       attempted   to  start  an  organization	which  would  bring
       together	self-perceived	Rs  for	 social	 activities.   They
       posted  two  short announcements	in college and local papers
       with the	 headline,  'STRAIGHT  GAYS.'  The  leaders  rather
       crudely	hinted	that this new club would be for	those young
       gays 'not  entirely  comfortable	 with  the  glittering	bar
       crowd.'	One  of	 the  authors  attending the organization's
       first meeting.  He found	the room packed	 with  excited	and
       grateful	 Rs,  who immediately set about	the organization of
       the  club  activities  ranging  from  baseball	to   opera-
       listening.   The	only qualification for membership was self-
       selection according  to	the  understood	 character  of	the
       organization,  and  its	aims  remained	social	rather than
       political. ...  Within weeks, the club was regularly drawing
       to its meetings between one and two hundred members - making
       it one of the most active gay groups  in	 Boston.  ...	Its
       leaders likened the group to the	gay clubs designed to bring
       together	men with  other	 special  interests,  such  as	the
       black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite, or 'man/boy love'
       societies in town.
       ""Boston's  gay  leadership  did	not  buy  the	comparison,
       however.	  There	was evident suspicion and resentment (based
       some part, no doubt, on envy) at	the prospect  of  'student-
       aged'   all-American   Rs   cloistering	 exclusively  among
       themselves for social and sexual	companionship.	A local	gay
       newspaper  attacked  the	group openly for its supposed macho
       snobbery	and for	the 'closet cases' it  seemed  to  nurture.
       ...    The   organization's  leaders  protested	that  their
       intentions had been misunderstood  (although,  in  a  sense,
       they   have  been  all-to-clearly  understood  -	 and  found
       politically incorrect).	But eventually they  bowed  to	the
       pressure.   Over	 two  years  they  gradually phased out	the
       stress upon 'straight gays.'  The  criticism  from  the	gay
       community  stopped  coming.  Alas, so did the group's R-type
       members.	 Having	lost  its  distinctive	drawing	 card,	the
       entire  operation  fizzled.   It	 had  failed the test of PC
       administered by the Q-oriented community. ...
       ""And there is a final twist in the Q/R cold  war	 which	may
       impede  the  growth of gay rights from time to time.  R-type
       gays are	the ones who actually succeed in slipping into	the
       circles	of mainstream political	power in America.  So it is
       a sad irony that	confidential liaisons between uptight Rs in
       government  and	Qs heading the gay activist movement can be
       further	strained  by  the   R's	  basic	  alienation   form
       unconventional Qs in general. ...
       ""This  analysis	has  found  the	 gay  world  troubled	and
       handicapped by the mutual alienation of Qs and Rs.  It is PC
       to deny this split. ...	First, we must abandon PC myths	and
       admit  that  the	 split	exists.	 Second, we must understand
       clearly the root	cause of the Q/R cold  war.   Someone  once
       called  it  'oppression	sickness':  each outgroup member is
       ill-at-ease with	himself, and is	frustrated  by	his  forced
       companions,  because the	social mainstream imposes pressures
       and expectations	which he feels that  he	 cannot	 meet,	and
       because	his  companions	 remind	him of his own failure.	 So
       the more	progress we can	make toward  social  acceptance	 in
       the  straight world for gays as a whole,	the less tension we
       will see	between	groups within the gay world. ...
       ""In the meantime, the gay  community  should  recognize	the
       distinct	identity and special problems of R-type	homosexuals
       - and could begin by expanding the aegis	of PC tolerance	 to
       include R-type organizations.
       ""At the same time, the community	 must  also  burn  off	the
       chaff of	its own	implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""","VMx87SJctxwJ",8,1985-11-22,-33,17

two polar categories of gay men, based on how they were able to
conform in youth and how they accepted ""gayified"" behavior in adulthood.
Things don't seem that clear cut to me for several reasons:
The first reason is that I wouldn't know whether to classify myself as
a Q or R. On one hand, much of ""gayified"" behavior and style really
turns me off. Just as the authors say of R's, my reaction OFTEN
is ""Why would someone want to appear that way?"" On the other hand,
I don't shun the gay ghetto and, like Q's, I suspect that a gay man
who does so suffers from internalized homophobia. In my childhood,
I was an unathletic sissy. I could not conform, but unlike the author's
description of Q youths, I did not turn non-conformity into anti-conformity.
Instead I deeply wished I could conform.
The second reason is that I often meet ""gayified"" gay men who DID
conform in their youth. They were athletic, they joined a fraternity,
etc. And now as adults they conform within the gay ghetto. Because of
their conformity to some ""gayified"" style, if I had to classify them
as Q's or R's, I would chose Q's. They OFTEN aren't particularly
effeminate, but rather ""masculine"" clone types, who are on one of the
gay bar's softball teams in the gay softball league, who go out
to gay discos on the weekend (at least prior to the epidemic), and in
general, seem to keep their social life restricted pretty much to the
gay ghetto.
The third reason has to do with gay self-hatred. The authors say that R's
put a premium on straight appearance because they were
able to conform and reap the benefits of conformity during their youth.
The authors explain the R's dislike of gayified behavior as
inability to appreciate why Q's lean towards anti-conformity.
The authors claim that the Q's view this dislike as gay self-hatred,
and that the Q's are merely un-understanding of the R's premium on
conformity. I strongly disagree. There is quite a bit of ""R-like""
behavior that IS motivated by homophobia, although it would be
difficult to ascertain how much of this dislike of various
""gayified"" behavior comes from homophobia.
But on the other hand, a lot of what the authors say rings true.
I think that this is so because what they describe are not two
types of gay PERSONS, but rather two DYNAMICS IN OUR PERSONALITIES.
I see both the ""R"" dynamic and the ""Q"" dynamic at work in my own
personality, in my own style, and in the personalities and styles
of my gay male friends. Furthermore, most gay men I meet show quite
a mixture of these two dynamics. As for the way I ""categorize"" (or not)
myself, I do not think of myself as a gayified gay or as a ""straight""
gay, but as a Rob-Bernardo-gay (or as a just plain Rob-Bernardo). I often
feel very critical of gay men who have moved to San Francisco and
gotten too GHETTOIZED. They seem to have lost their individuality
in conforming to the gay ghetto. But that's another posting to net.motss.
So, what I think the authors missed is that conformity in youth
can lead to conformity to the gay ghetto in adulthood, and that
some dislike for gayified behavior is due to homophobia.","GilhGtHFa8wJ",23,1985-11-23,-11,10

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)

	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of

    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

I would be interested in a proof on how gay sexual behaviour is self-
destructive. I engage in it with my lover, and I have found that it is
constructive; the physical act is only one aspect of it. I guess I don't
believe in sex, only making love. A bonding occurs (or should, in my
opinion) when such an act is performed. I'm afraid that Mr. Ardnt is the
one who seems to lack understanding of what the act is all about.
He also evidences a lack of understanding in what exactly occurs in
homosexual acts.

I'd be interested in a proof demonstrating that it is a perversion. Such 
behaviour occurs elsewhere in nature (it's been observed in marine mammals
and avian species among other). And who is he to say what sexual fulfilment
(or fulfullment, as he says)is anyway? What may be fulfilling for him may not
be for others. I'm afraid Mr. Ardnt lack the quality of empathy.

Again, can he prove his assertion? Anal intercourse is not the only way to
communicate the disease, and it may not be the only factor. The condition
of the immune system at the time the virus is introduced to the body may
be a factor as well.
Mr. Ardnt makes many assertions, but I think the proof for the, if it exists,
is flimsy at best. It is nice to see something written by him which is
halfway decent though. That's nice.","g9t8pGWN0fIJ",2,1985-11-16,11,25

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

because they were sufficiently promiscuous that their chances of coming
across an infected person was very high.  Now that HTLV-3 antibodies can be
found in a significant percentage of gay men, at least in certain cities

personas most familiar to the straight world: the pomaded and permed 'fem',
the titanic leather master, the	clipped	clone, the _ G_ Q hyperboy,	and others.
...  Qs	are outwardly _ g_ a_ y_ i_ f_ i_ e_ d;	 they  have  bought  into  strict  outgroup
stereotypes  which,  whether  screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
constitute a burlesque of gender roles.	 Qs think of themselves	as  visible
gays, and tend to make such a profile central to their ego structure. ...
""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,	and  Qs	 are  perhaps  more
likely	than  Rs  to  be  drawn	 toward	 the asylum of gay ghettos in urban
centers. ...
""Whereas Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and so  did,  many	 Qs
felt that, for whatever	reasons, they could not	conform	during their youth,
and so	did  not.   Those  reasons  might  include  passivity,	effeminacy,
homeliness,  remarkable	 prettiness,  lack of athletic skill, or almost	any
other cause for	unpopularity among male	youth.	At first,  evidently,  many
Qs  were unhappy loners	who salvaged their self-esteem by making a lodestar
virtue	out  of	 _ i_ n_ d_ i_ v_ i_ d_ u_ a_ l_ i_ s_ m	rather	than  peer  acceptance.	  But  non-
conformity engenders anti-conformism.  So some Qs went further and acquired
a taste	for outrageousness, actively calculating shock to others  in  order
to reinforce their social status as rebels with	a cause. ...
""As the	years go by, and they learn that  they	are  not  alone,  Qs  adopt
zealously  the	visible	 uniforms and credos of	their supporting outgroups.
...  Surveys have shown	that, for many Qs, camp	behavior is a passing phase
of overt defiance, toned down in later years.
""When those gays who boast R-status meet those who defend  Q-status,  there
can  be	 trouble.   First, let's look at things	for the	viewpoint of the R.
For one	thing, the sexual objects of Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs,  for	the
most  part  are	scorned. ...  It is the	'fem' [from among the variety of Q-
type personas] who bears the brunt of the invective from Rs. ...
""[Gay] bars are	often regarded by Rs as	the bastions of	self-segregated	 Qs
-  branded  as twinkie bars, leather bars, etc.	- and so may be	viewed with
distaste. ...
""We should mention at this point that those Rs who shun	the  bars  find	 it
more  difficult	 to lead satisfactory sex lives.  They have trouble meeting
other Rs because, unlike visible Qs, out in the	straight world most Rs have
banished  any  tell-tale  signals  of  homosexuality  from their conformist
uniforms and are wary of mistaken self-exposures. ...
""To make sexual	matters	still more difficult for many  Rs,  they  face	two
more  unique  dilemmas.	 ...  First, ... a Q may be drawn to, and satisfied
by, a relationship with	an acceptably masculine	R.  But	what of	the classic
R-type	-  the 'all-American boy' whose	only felt shortcoming is his sexual
preference?  For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual object  possessing	the
one  feature he	feels he lacks and wishes to capture - may very	well be	the
straight boy, who is, by definition, unattainable. ...
""The second sexual dilemma faced by Rs	involves  the  ritual  of  sex-play
itself.	  For at least some Rs,	it seems, masculine _ r_ o_ l_ e _ p_ e_ r_ f_ o_ r_ m_ a_ n_ c_ e is	the
most thrilling part of sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened  in	 homosexual
practices such as passive anal sex or active fellatio. ...
""But even if the R is contentedly 'out'	to family and  friends,	 and  self-
exposure is not	an issue, he may still dislike Qs for two related reasons.
""First,	because	the R has typically conformed with ease	to the	mainstream,
the  exaggerated  outgroup displays of Qs simply _ b_ a_ f_ f_ l_ e	him.  Why would	any
person _ c_ h_ o_ o_ s_ e to draw such public ridicule and abuse, he wonders?  ...	 'I
don't  see why they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
[we interviewed].  'It obviously looks phony and fools no  one.'  At  best,
then,  many Rs come to view Qs the way that many straights view	homosexuals
_ e_ n _ b_ l_ o_ c, as somehow foolish and	trivial, a nationality of sterile  cuckoos.
...
""Second, Qs do more than baffle	Rs - they also _ i_ r_ r_ i_ t_ a_ t_ e	Rs terribly,  to  a
degree	that  more  detached  straights	cannot understand.  Many Rs plainly
resent being identified	with the Qs, and blame them for	the  weird  profile
of homosexuals as a whole. ...
""Like most gay males, it seems,	even exotic Qs hear the	siren call  of	the
rutting	R.  And	so relations between Qs	and Rs grow still more tense.
""It is our impression that, for	_ b_ o_ t_ h Rs	and Qs,	archetypal Rs the 'idols of
the  tribe.'  It  is  the  R whose natural masculine grace tops	the overall
hierarchy of desirable traits in the fierce gay	competition of good  looks.
Handsome  Rs  often  sense  this  pecking order, and feeds their egos while
hardening their	disdain	for Qs,	especially the effeminate ones.	...
""Many Qs may learn from	necessity to refocus their libido on fellow Qs.	...
""For it	is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after the  R	 as  sexual
object,	they may also resent and reject	him as social companion!  There	are
several	reasons	for this rejections. 'Sour  grapes'  is	 an  understandable
reaction  from those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
have defensively fashioned a lifestyle out of  peculiar	 individualism	are
bound  to resent (and perhaps envy just	a little) those	gays who can and do
successfully conform to	straight standards.  ...   There  is  more  to	Q/R
estrangement than just these problems.
""For one thing,	if the handsome	all-American straight boy is  the  ultimate
sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-type homosexual must appear as
a ghostly mock-up of the real thing. ...
""Further, Rs are still more upsetting to those Qs who believe that  'butch'
behavior  is  just  an	unnatural  put-on  for gays. ...  Just as the anti-
conformity of Qs baffles  Rs,  the  ease  with	which  Rs  conform  to	the
mainstream   may  be  hard  for	 Qs  to	 understand.  ...   Hence,  Qs	may
misinterpret the Rs' ingrained disinclination  to  gayified  behavior,	and
label it homophobia. ...
""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type persona as	the  'true'
gay type, and hence feel like outsiders	within their own outgroup. ...
""How do	these tensions between Rs and  Qs  affect  the	social	structures,
political  institutions,  and  activist	 success  of the gay community?	...
Those who could	not hide have instead turned to	make  their  stand  against
oppression,  and  Qs  have risen to political leadership and brotherhood in
the activist movement across America.  This is to  their  credit.   Extreme
Qs,  as	 a  group, may rate below Rs on	the sociosexual	hierarchy, but they
can and	do rank	above them on the scale	 of  _ p_ o_ l_ i_ t_ i_ c_ a_ l	power  in  the	gay
world.
""In the	meantime, reticent Rs, who benefit from	the sacrifices	of  Qs	and
yet carp about their flamboyant	image in the straight world, have been able
to have	it both	ways: they achieve  personal  acceptability  in	 the  right
straight  world	 of  today,  while  relishing  the  progress  toward social
flexibility made on their behalf for  tomorrow.	  But  because	Rs  do	not
choose to play the activist game in great numbers, they	lose their ability,
as a group, to influence the rules of that game.
""Although the point is hard to prove with certainty, we	suspect	that it	 is
mainly	Qs  who	organize the gay community, set	its norms, and decide which
of its collective efforts are PC ['politically correct'].   PC	initiatives
are  those  which  the gay leadership and press	deem to	be good	for the	gay
community as a whole.  And the mobilization  of	 the  R-type  subgroup,	 it
turns out, is definitely _ n_ o_ t PC	- at least, not	in Boston.  Let	us give	you
an example.
""Several years ago, a handful of young men in that city	attempted to  start
an  organization  which	 would	bring together self-perceived Rs for social
activities.  They posted two  short  announcements  in	college	 and  local
papers	with  the  headline,  'STRAIGHT	 GAYS.'	 The leaders rather crudely
hinted that this new club would	be  for	 those	young  gays  'not  entirely
comfortable  with  the	glittering bar crowd.' One of the authors attending
the organization's first meeting.  He found the	room  packed  with  excited
and  grateful  Rs,  who	 immediately set about the organization	of the club
activities  ranging   from   baseball	to   opera-listening.	 The   only
qualification for membership was self-selection	according to the understood
character of the organization, and its aims  remained  social  rather  than
political.  ...	  Within  weeks,  the  club  was  regularly  drawing to	its
meetings between one and two hundred members - making it one  of  the  most
active	gay groups in Boston. ...  Its leaders likened the group to the	gay
clubs designed to bring	together men with other	special	interests, such	 as
the  black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite,	or 'man/boy love' societies
in town.
""Boston's gay leadership did not buy the comparison,  however.	 There	was
evident	 suspicion  and	 resentment (based some	part, no doubt,	on envy) at
the prospect of	 'student-aged'	 all-American  Rs  cloistering	exclusively
among  themselves  for	social	and  sexual  companionship.   A	 local	gay
newspaper attacked the group openly for	its supposed macho snobbery and	for
the  'closet  cases'  it seemed	to nurture. ...	 The organization's leaders
protested that their intentions	had  been  misunderstood  (although,  in  a
sense,	they  have  been  all-to-clearly understood - and found	politically
incorrect).  But eventually they bowed to the  pressure.   Over	 two  years
they  gradually	 phased	 out the stress	upon 'straight gays.' The criticism
from the gay community stopped coming.	Alas, so  did  the  group's  R-type
members.   Having  lost	 its distinctive drawing card, the entire operation
fizzled.  It had failed	the test  of  PC  administered	by  the	 Q-oriented
community. ...
""And there is a	final twist in the Q/R cold war	which may impede the growth
of  gay	 rights	 from  time to time.  R-type gays are the ones who actually
succeed	in slipping into the  circles  of  mainstream  political  power	 in
America.   So  it is a sad irony that confidential liaisons between uptight
Rs in government and Qs	heading	the gay	activist movement  can	be  further
strained by the	R's basic alienation form unconventional Qs in general.	...
""This analysis has found the gay world	troubled  and  handicapped  by	the
mutual	alienation  of Qs and Rs.  It is PC to deny this split.	...  First,
we must	abandon	PC myths and admit that	the split exists.  Second, we  must
understand clearly the root cause of the Q/R cold war.	Someone	once called
it  'oppression	 sickness':   each  outgroup  member  is  ill-at-ease  with
himself,  and  is  frustrated  by his forced companions, because the social
mainstream imposes pressures and expectations which he feels that he cannot
meet,  and  because  his  companions remind him	of his own failure.  So	the
more progress we can make toward social	acceptance in  the  straight  world
for gays as a whole, the less tension we will see between groups _ w_ i_ t_ h_ i_ n	the
gay world. ...
""In the	meantime, the gay community should recognize the distinct  identity
and  special  problems of R-type homosexuals - and could begin by expanding
the aegis of PC	tolerance to include R-type organizations.
""At the	same time, the community must also burn	off the	chaff  of  its	own
implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""

& street fair on Christopher Street took place under hot (80s) sunny
skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters
out there willing to post a detailed article?

>Robert DeBenedictis
I believe the word ""homophobia"" was coined by Dr. George Weinberg in his
book ""Society and the Healthy Homosexual"" (1973), in which he argues
that the fear homosexuality exhibited by many individuals in our
culture has all the earmarks of a psychological phobia, and therefor
it is those who hate/fear/etc. homosexuals/homosexuality who have
a psychological illness, not the persons who are homosexual.
He argues that it is prevalent among males to fear other males,
in other than purely sexual ways.
He uses ""homophobia"" to refer to this phobia (i.e. irrational fear)
towards people of the same sex, and therefore towards homosexuality
and homosexuals.
By backformation, we have created the word ""homophobe"" to refer to
someone who suffers from homophobia. I have always thought of 
""homophobe"" as parallel in formation to ""homosexual"".
The ""homo-"" is the Greek prefix for ""same"",
hence ""homosexual"" refers to ""sex"" with someone of the ""same [gender]"",
and ""homophobe"" refers to ""phobia"" towards someone of the ""same [gender]"".
It never occurred to me that one might think of the ""homo"" part as not
being a prefix, but of being slang shortening of ""homosexual"", as if
to say ""queerphobe"".

there are two.  the first is to love the lord your god with your whole

so call me a CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  you're a HOMOPHOBE!!!  and you're damned,
right, I AM A CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  (I do have friends who are Christian,
but they seem to have more open minds than most of the Christians i've
talked to)...i'm scared to death that one day my sexual preference will

to hide our feelings for each other just because of what society thinks...
if you had your way, i might get ARRESTED for that!!!!  and why shouldn't
i be able to kiss him if i like??  don't you touch or kiss or hold hands
with YOUR Significant Other (wife, gf, whatever) in public??
just don't expect a warm welcome on my front porch when you come to tell
me i'm doomed to hell, or three of you get together with a bunch of chains
and beat up some of my friends coming out of a gay bar or you assault the
youngest of us (gay men and lesbians) that are part of your own flesh as
well, deny them their right to live and love as they choose and leave
them with scars that perhaps will never be erased...
if i was to come to your door bearing such glad tidings, i bet that you'd

Um, just to give my own two-cents, Larry, welcome to the net and
{mod,net}.motss, but as you might expect, this discussion is not
particularly new or novel to readers of net.motss, is not a central
purpose of net.motss, and has been successfully exorcised several
times before.  Right now it seems to be precariously contained to
net.religion.christian, where both sides of the discussion can
generate as much heat as they like.  Were I involved in such a

What ever happened to it?  It's still active.  True, there are folk who will
decide that they should be the instruments of God's wrath.  On the other hand,
there are those who believe that they have to speak the truth as they see it,
just as you believe that you must be true to yourself.
Please, save your anger for the former group.  The latter are just as sincere
as you are, whether you can understand it or not.  They believe that they have
a duty, both to God and to YOU to speak as they do.

That circular track, for some lucky  people, is the belief that they should

where do you draw the line between believing that you are doing the right thing

And there are PLENTY of Christians who will do the same thing.  That's
compassion and common sense and it does not contradict our instructions from

For the thoughtful Christian, this is the crux of a moral dilemma:  Does
this orientation, not of an individual's choosing, give someone the burden

Hmm.  I don't know anyone who does that.  As I said, there are dilemmas

we want to see you burn in Hell.''

I doubt that you are speaking to your audience here.  It's unlikely that too
many people on this net are doing many of the things that you have described.
And the people engaging in assuaults such as those you describe are NOT
behaving in a very Christian manner, so perhaps flaming at Christians is not
speaking to your audience either.

What?  You don't eat, put your pants (or nylons) on one leg at a time,

Unfortunately, most Christians ignore the rest of that book of the Bible,
eating pork and shellfish, milk at the same meal as meat (and on the same
dishes, even), and only pick out these half dozen verses to claim as God's
Law out of Leviticus.  Isn't this a bit hypocritical?

You just want society to say that because what we are doing is 'not right'
(according to you), we should be allowed to be fired from our jobs, thrown
out of our houses...  Not quite burning at the stake, is it?  Burning is
faster!

Forutunately, even in those states where it is still illegal, the courts
are throwing such laws out (Texas was the last).  And I agree, Christian
intolerance has been going on for far to long.

But I know lots of young people who have been thrown out of their
Christian parents home because they were gay, often after being
subjected to avertion therapy, electo-shock therapy, or prayer
marathons.  Sorry, but they call themselves Christians and go to
Church 4 times a week and read their Bibles.  Jerry Falwell, that
'great Chrittian fellow' in the news for the last few years, tells
lies on his pulpit.  I can only go by what they tell me, since enough
of them act the same way, I assume its a Christian trait.  Even you
seem to want to 'keep me in my place' ('we don't want society to
endorse what you do').
Fuck off Christian!

Today in New York, the Scientists Institute for Public Information met
to gather all valid information on AIDS to give the press and insure
the accuracy of news coverage & public knowledge.  It was hoped that
such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused, unable to find time in his schedule to attend.  The
fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused the creation of
three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen: HTLV-III by
Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much reserch & testing.","2sl3JcHlEH8J",18,1985-02-09,-12,29

Newport Beach, Calif. -
Scientists have for the first time identified an antibody that inactivates
the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome virus in laboratory experiments, a
step toward development of an AIDS vaccine,  a researcher said yesterday.
Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute,  who headed one of the
two teams that announced discovery of the likely AIDS virus last April,
said the antibody knocks out the ability of the AIDS virus to infect cells.
But Gallo warned that the discovery ""does not prove you're going to be 
successful in finding a vaccine.""
Asked if he believes an anti-AIDS vaccine can be developed, Gallo replied:
""I am hopeful....but it's really hard to say when.""
Considerable research must be done to determine whether the anti-AIDS anti-
body will destroy the virus in the human body as effectively as it destroys
it in the laboratory.
Gallo described the discovery while talking to reporters attending a 
scientific conference in Newport Beach sponsored by the City of Hope 
Medical Center.  He said the discovery, made only recently,  has not 
been reported in a scientific journal.
The so-called ""neutralizing antibody"" was identified by Dr. Marjorie 
Robert-Guroff in Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute 
and independently by Dr. Martin Hirsch at Massachusetts General Hos-
pital, Gallo said.
Reached in Boston, Hirsch confirmed the discovery of the antibody against
AIDS, but declined further comment, except to say his findings will soon 
be published in a letter to the editor of a medical journal -- which he
declined to identify -- and will be presented in April during an AIDS 
conference in Atlanta.
The virus attacks a certain class of white blood cells called T-cells,
which help the body ward off disease.  The virus is called HTLV-III,
and was discovered by Gallo and his colleagues last year.
It is the third of a class of human viruses called human T-cell lympho-
tropic viruses.
A closely related virus, called LAV, or lymphadenopathy associated virus,
was discovered about the same time by researchers at the Pasteur Institute
in Paris.
A major question has been whether the viruses are identical.  If they are
very different, it could complicate the search for a vaccine.
But Gallo said yesterday that HTLV-III and LAV essentially are the same
despite a 5 percent to 10 percent variation in the genetic code which
governs activities of the 104 different types of AIDS virus Gallo said
have so far been isolated.
It is not yet known whether those genetic differences mean the viruses
act differently biologically, he said.  If they did, it might mean that
a vaccine effective against one variety of AIDS virus might not work
against another.
But, Gallo added: ""Right now we can't say there's any important biologi-
cal difference.""

From METROLINE, a hartford conn paper, Dec 28, 1984:  (Quoted w/o permission)
			TWO MORE HETEROSEXUAL *AIDS* CASES REPORTED
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Researchers reported two new heterosexual cases of 
	Aquired [sic] Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and warned the mysterious and
	often fatal disease could become an endemic to people of all sexual
	persuasions [sic, I say ``orientations''].
	 Drs. Paul Volberding and Constance Wofsy called a press conference to 
	report their findings and to urge ""safe sex"" practices for all San 
	Francisco Bay area residents.
	 Volberding recommended that hetersexuals confine sexual activity to 
	one partner, avoid promiscuity and use condoms consistently and 
	carefully with new partners.
	 ""It would be irresponsible not to give early notice to the 
	heterosexual community that sexual contact with persons carrying the 
	AIDS virus appears to put them at a risk for contracting the disease,"" 
	Volberding said.
	 The two latest heterosexual AIDS victims [sic, never say ``victim'' to 
	one who has AIDS] brings the total to four of cases outside the 
	so-called high risk category of homosexual men in San Francisco in less
	than one month. 
	 One case involved a woman who apparently contracted the disease three 
	and half years ago after an affair with a bisexual man.  Three 
	heterosexual men with AIDS have a history of sexual contacts with 
	prostitutes, Volberding said.
	 Volberding, director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic, 
	said the new cases ""further confirm our concern that AIDS is a disease 
	that hetersexuals can develop.  The major factor appears to be direct 
	sexual contact with persons who have the AIDS virus.
I offer this article only as a note.  The article isn't the best on the block,

	Concerning KS: it is just a tendency, it is after all an opportunistic

one sees in Manhattan (primarily gay) and one sees here in the Bronx (IV)

false negatives and positives occur with all tests. Immunoassays tend to be
very good. They also tend to improve with use, since better antigens are

	There is another kind of False Positive however. 
	Remember, even if one comes out truely positive on the test, there is

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

mechanism for AIDS & why only some people exposed to the pathogen
(whatever it is; NO ONE yet knows for sure) develop full-blown
AIDS.
They hypothesize that AIDS is transmitted by receiving T-cells
themselves from an infected person.  This results in the mild
AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and asymptomatic forms (ie, ""car-
riers"").  Full-blown AIDS occurs by receiving T-cells into
which the pathogen has injected genetic material.  This hypo-
thesis is really the first anyone's advanced which feasibly
explains the very puzzling selectivity of AIDS.
Has anyone else heard anything about this?  The US medical
establishment as usual seems hopelessly out of it.  Gallo's
HTLV-III find seems to be declining in signifigance as each
month passes.
The French see a lot of heterosexual cases traceable to Central
Africa.  The current NYNative has a long article on the intensive
African research that's just beginning, performed mainly by French
researchers, but with a half-dozen Americans participating.  The
author believes that the next 6 months of reports of African research
results will dispel once and for all any perceptions of AIDS as a
""gay disease"".
The current Native has other AIDS articles that show how complicated
the AIDS research picture has grown.  One physician in a Florida
town with a large Haitian population reports a high incidence of
HTLV III and a growing number of AIDS cases.  He believes that AIDS
is in fact KS, a relatively new or rare form, not the sluggish skin
cancer, but one which grows in lymph nodes & never appears externally.
His reasoning is that every AIDS patient doctors have thought to test
for the internal form of KS has displayed it, even patients who had 
the ""traditional"" external form of KS as well.
The HTLV-III blood test now seems virtually worthless.  The Native
reports that a large group of people who scored positive on it
showed negative results when another more reliable & much more 
expensive test for HTLV-III was used.
Furthermore, due to the lack of a guarantee of confidentiality
given to the 200,000 gay men who in good faith participated in
HTLV-III testing a few months ago,  large numbers are justifiably
refusing to be retested & thus seriously jeopardize the study's 
value.  Maybe now the federal medical bureaucracies will begin
to take their hippocratic oaths & professional ethics seriously
(maybe this will even inspire the ACLU or someone else to take
on the barbaric & grossly unconstitutional statutes which pass
for public health law in an epidemic, which few Americans know
anything about).
(So, as many physicians (including Curran of the CDC) advise, DON'T
TAKE THE HTLV-III TEST!!!!!!!  Its signifigance is UNKNOWN, it may
well be WORTHLESS, & leaves one open to serious discrimination &
abuse!  If you think you have symptoms and aren't well, seek a
competent & trustworthy physician (not necessarily easy to do),
PREFERABLY a gay doctor, who's AWARE of gay lifestyles & homopho-
bia; even then, don't automatically have the test: find out first
what if anything it can offer you and how it relates to your com-
plaints.  Marcus Welby is an utter myth!)

  Forty percent of the single men in San Francisco are homosexual, and most of

professional survey.
  The survey by the Research and Decisions Corporation, commissioned by the

[This section heavily condensed]
Of 706,900 SF'ers, 69,960 are homosexual (based on 500 half-hour interviews).
32% of homosexual men in SF earn more than $30K, with 31% earning $20-$30K.
57% graduated from college, incl. 21% who continued in post-grad education.
42% of homosexual men in SF report they are in monogamous relationships and
13% have one primary relationship that includes outside sexual activity.
78% have all-male sexual partners, 14% are bisexual with mostly male partners
and 7% are bisexual with mostly female partners.
More than half of the homosexual men are in professional-managerial positions
or operate their own businesses.  Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.
About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,
with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.
A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliability
of the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed off
to them because they're gay.""  However, he also noted that many affluent
homosexuals were moving into San Francisco.

It is important to note a few important things about that survey:
1) that the survey was NOT a random sample,
2) the 500 were TELEPHONE interviews and more than 10% of the 
   salaries reported have already been declared as inflated
   and the investigation has just begun...think about it -
   if you weren't making much money and someone asked you
   how much you were making, in a telephone interview, wouldn't
   you be inclined to inflate it a little bit???
Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms,
and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia
from growing up in a world determined to assume that
everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are
all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia -
like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the
view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia
could be used against us...
just a thought from a lesbian here in sf...

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

			PART SIX
[NYNative, 8/29-9/11/83, S. Christopher Hagsch, ""CDC May Be Shaving
Figures"", p. 8]
A source within CDC's AIDS project said AIDS cases figures ""are inaccurate
for many states because Dr. Brandt [Assistant Secretary, Health & Human
Services, HHS] wants it that way.  Less money will be appropriated for
research if the numbers are smaller.""
(Note this is against a background of chronic underfunding of AIDS efforts
even for the most rudimentary projects.)
For example, in July (1983) Tennessee reported 8 confirmed cases, but the
CDC monthly tally claimed 2.  Four of the 8 victims had died as of July!
In June Tennessee reported 5, CDC claimed only 2.  In August, CDC still
claimed only 2 cases!
CDC Public Affairs office spokesperson Chuck Fallis speculated ""I don't
know [what is causing the discrepancy].  My best guess is... a time lag.""
A two-month time-lag, he was asked?  ""I don't know.""
On August 18th the Texas Public Health Dept. reported 62 AIDS cases, but
CDC claimed there were only 47.
CDC credibility was low enough & the discrepancies large enough that
NGTF and Weiss & his HSGOH  said they ""might poll the states"" directly
themselves to find what the actual figures were!
There had been problems from the beginning with CDC reporting: the basic
information (number & distirbution of cases) needed to do any serious
planning or writing of budget proposals to obtain funds was not being 
reliably gathered & reported by CDC, & they revealed little incentive
to obtain the information.

Complaints about Ken Arndt in net.motss tend to take one (or all) of
three directions: he's not supportive, he's unintelligible, or he's
rude.  In response to the complaint that he's rude and unsupportive,
some have argued that he appears to be knowledgable and perhaps, at
times, even reasonable. In response to such responses, others have
denied the possibility that he may be reasonable, argued that his
rudeness is the main point to be considered, and/or suggested that he
attempt to become intelligible that his points, if there be any besides
a hypothetical one atop his head, be better understood.
Let me reject the ""not supportive"" complaint out of hand; why someone
must be supportive to be heard escapes my understanding. (After all,
I tolerate liberals in net.politics -- though it appears some have
great difficulty tolerating me.) And I think that most net.motss
readers, gay and otherwise, agree. (Let me also reject the complaint
not noted above, that he has no answers to the problems he raises.
Who does?) Leaving, of the three types of complaints I noted, that he
is frequently unintelligible and rude.
On to intelligibility. I frequently find such luminaries as Sartre,
Connell, Eliot, Hamsun, Lagerkvist, Pynchon, Brecht, Ionesco, and
Baudelaire... unintelligible. On the other hand, I sometimes find
them intelligible, which sustains me in reading their works. And I
have found that it is generally true that just that which makes them
so often unintelligible makes their message, when I am hit with it,
so forceful. Now, one need not include Ken in the list above -- i.e.,
as of the same rank -- to consider the possibility that his style suits
him as the best to get across his points. To make a point, it may
sometimes be necessary to strike the listener in the face with a dead
fish. Would you reduce the efforts of, say, Ionesco to that which would
fit on a bumper sticker? (It would save a lot of trees; ""The Lesson""
could be reduced to ""Communication is Fraught with Difficulty,"" and
certainly everyone would understand that communication.) Would
you wait till the author died, and read the books of criticism about
the author's work? It's usually easier than reading the work itself.
Would you have the author write an essay as dull as this one (albeit
in better prose, no doubt)? Or would you admit the possibility that the
author embedded his meaning as much in the form of his work as in the
words? That in order to understand it, you had to do more than
intellectualize? (I remember, from Personality Theory or Abnormal
Psychology, when the professor explained ""intellectualization"" as
the defense mechanism which enabled 150 male students to hear him say
something like ""All males hate their fathers because they secretly want
to have sexual intercourse with their mothers,"" busily write it down,
and wait for the next point. Having missed the last one.)
Not that I think I've convinced anyone of anything, but let's get on
to rudeness. Really not getting on at all, since the same point
raised above -- that attention may be better commanded by striking
the listener in the face with a dead fish than by writing a deadly
boring essay such as I am now doing -- applies here. Maybe you
should regard Arndt as an onion in the stew of life, and not expect
your reasoned arguments to turn him into a carrot.
The suggestion has been tendered that someone, not Ken, who reads
an Arndt message and espies some redeeming quality there, translate
the message for the edification of the remainder of the crew. A bad
idea, I think, but since I am filled (indeed, brimming over) with
polite language (rather gray, but it doesn't disturb anyone as long
as I don't mention National Review), let me try an example. Ken
recently wrote in an article that when in boot camp he felt sorry
for a crying recruit who was kicked by every other recruit who passed
him, including, when Ken got to him, Ken. Some net.motss readers
read this as a brave ""coming out of the closet"" on Ken's part,
others as an expression of Ken's wimpiness/rudeness/brutality.
Enter Mr. Explain-it-in-all-gray-tones! Ahem. ""In the message from
Ken, which you are not reading because its style, nay, its very
language, was deemed inappropriate, Ken related an anecdote, or
perhaps a parable, to the effect that today's polite sympathy may not
translate into polite actions on the morrow."" Really grabbed you, eh?
Thought so.
(You know, as I was mentally composing this essay, I kept hearing
Muzak playing when I thought of the brave new world we all expect
when everyone talks and writes ever so politely, and reasonably,
like, say, me. I couldn't figure out why the damned Muzak was
playing for a couple of hours, when I suddenly was hit by the
shopping market scene at the end of ""Stepford Wives."" I'd explain
the scene in words, but I'm afraid I'd gray so far as to disappear.)
Listen, I suspect two things: That Ken is damned nigh well unique
(certainly on this net), and that the kind of person many net.motss
readers think he is, is not. It's the latter you've got to look
out for and try to sway. Run off to mod.motss if you will, where
the moderator will protect you from immoderate opinions -- but
if everything turns to shit, and the world comes tumbling down
on your head, please refrain from asking ""But they all seemed so
nice! What happened?""
I can sense that some of you (most of you?) are still unconvinced.
Very well, in better polite language than my own...
     ""Perhaps there is really no such thing as a Revolution
     recorded in history. What happened was always a Counter-
     Revolution. Men were always rebelling against the last
     rebels; or even repenting of the last rebellion. This
     could be seen in the most casual contemporary fashions,
     if the fashionable mind had not fallen into the habit of
     seeing the very latest rebel as rebelling against all
     ages at once. The Modern Girl [this written in 1933]
     with the lipstick and the cocktail is as much a rebel
     against the Women's Rights Woman of the '80's, with her
     stiff stick-up collars and strict teetotalism, as the
     latter was a rebel against the Early Victorian lady of the
     languid waltz tunes and the album full of quotations from
     Byron; or as the last, again, was a rebel against a
     Puritan mother to whom the waltz was a wild orgy and
     Byron the Bolshevist of his age. Trace even the Puritan
     mother back through history and she represents a rebellion
     against the Cavalier laxity of the English Church, which
     was at first a rebel against the Catholic civilisation,
     which had been a rebel against the Pagan civilisation.
     Nobody but a lunatic could pretend that these things
     were a progress; for they obviously go first one way and
     then the other.""

City, New York, pp. 76-77, 1956. Which is, of course, irrelevant
because it was written by (a) a conservative who (b) is dealing with
a religious topic.]
Of course, Ken may be simply as you see him: a rude and unintelligible
boor. Yes, Ken could be exactly what many of you think he is, a bad
boy so typical of the religious right. So typical.
Keep your eyes on him.

""unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", ""rude""?  Do you actually read
either Arndt's or anyone else's postings in net.motss?  (I'm get-
ting tired of asking this rather rhetorical question, but the
myopia on this net is just unbelievable!)
SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson 
are that they're bigoted, insulting, exhibitionistic in really loathsome
ways (like, for example, street psychotics), filled with hatred and
self-hatred, etc. etc.  And this adds up to merely ""rude""?  Is it
merely ""rude"" to call a group of blacks ""filthy niggers"" who ought
to be ""hung from the nearest available tree"" AND then launch into,
say, ""rational"" discussion of race relations and the legislative
agenda before Congress?  And then swerve into a polemic denouncing
funding for sickle cell anemia (""Let 'em die!  We'll finally have
social peace!""), and discourse repetitively & at great length about
the genetic disposition of black men to commit rape (of white women,
that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt
Phenomenon is that bigoted and deliberately offensive postings 
are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this
option at all.

apologists for Arndt's behavior.  We are discussing, not ""supportiveness""
(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability to
treat a discussion and its members seriously.  Right now, there is
only one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.
Let's get one thing clear here.  If he acted this way in any other
newsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank.  If he behaved in
public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

that the gay agenda for increased civil recognition *requires* a broad-based

Every so often biblical passages purporting to censure gay sexuality get
posted to the net by presumably devout netters, perhaps as a kind of
public service to the unrighteous.  I imagine a poster thinking, ""This
will silence both silly religious liberals who seem incapable of recalling 
what the Bible actually says AND irreligious homosexual publicists who sim-
ply cannot tolerate the idea that there is at least one tradition/institu-
tion/faith that makes no ""allowance"" for homosexuality, no matter what de-
gree of accomodation secular institutions and attitudes are willing to make
for ""gays"".""  I then imagine a warm proprietary glow enveloping the poster,
mixed with a renewed disdain for the spinelessness of worldly ethics; phrases
like ""our Bible"" float subliminally in his mind; finally, a weary sigh escapes
his lips: though virtue is its own reward, those who will bear witness to the 
truth are doomed to repeat themselves in the company of the insensate (most
netters) -- how many times before has he quoted holy writ to these helium
heads? 
As a vehicle for rebutting those who cite scripture, I'm using Don Caprio's
recently posted list of biblical passages traditionally used to justify
Christian homophobia, followed by summaries of John Boswell's explications
of these passages.  Lines from Mr. Caprio's message begin with an angle
bracket.  I've added a few more passages he didn't include.
Numbers in curly brackets refer to page numbers in Boswell's book CHRIS-
TIANITY, SOCIAL TOLERANCE, & HOMOSEXUALITY (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1981,
$9.95 in paperback).  All errors of fact or interpretation are mine.
OT = Old Testament, NT = New Testament
I offer apologies in advance if any references to Judaism or Jews below
seem to slight or criticize either:  the clumsiness of my summarizing is 
to blame.
=======================================================================
> Here are some biblical references for the homosexuality [read ""homophobia""]
> issue:
""Some""?  In fact, these are most of the biblical passages construed as expres-
sing disapproval of gay sexuality, and, except for the Sodom story, the ones
most important for making the homophobic case.  Moreover, the entry below from 
Leviticus is ""the only place in the OT where homosexual acts per se are men-
tioned"" {100}.  The Sodom & Gomorrah episode does not mention or even likely
imply homosexuality.  The trend in scholarship since 1955 is to view it as a
fable about (violation of) hospitality, not sexuality. Boswell points out that
the homosexual interpretation is ""relatively recent"" and that no OT references
to the episode so interpret it. {92-99}
>    ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female;
>     it is an abomination.""
> 			       Leviticus 18:22  (NASB)
>    ""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who
>     lie with a woman, both of them have committed a
>     destestable act;...""
 
>			      Leviticus 20:13  (NASB)
""Abomination"" & ""detestable act"" are both translations of the Hebrew word
TOEVAH meaning ""something which is ritually unclean for Jews"" {100}, but
not usually something ""intrinsically evil"" {100-103}.  Eating pork or
having sex during menstruation is also ""toevah"".  Throughout the OT it
designates ""those Jewish sins involving ethnic contamination or idolatry""
{100}, often as the stock phrase ""toevah ha-goyim"", ""the uncleanness
of the gentiles"" {100}.
""Toevah"" often means ""idol"" {100}.  The first passage above immediately 
follows a prohibition of idolatrous & orgiastic religious rites:
	And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
	to Moloch.
			      Leviticus 18:21 (KJV)
The openings and purposes of both chapters, 18 & 20, are similar: to
provide guidelines to distinguish Jews from the pagans they lived among.
Chapter 20 details how ""ritual cleanliness"" is kept, and the beginning
of chapter 18 includes:
	After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
	ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
	I shall bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in
	their ordinances....
			      Leviticus 18:3 (KJV)
Although both chapters include prohibitions (eg., against incest and
adultery) of acts that are instrinsically wrong, Maimonides & other 
Jewish commentators agree that their mention here concerns ""their
function....as symbols of Jewish distinctiveness"" {101}.  By contrast,
recall that homosexual acts are mentioned nowhere else in the OT.
Even more to the point, Greek Bible texts, which along with the Vulgate
(Jerome's authoritative Latin translation, made from Greek texts) were
the versions of scripture used in Orthodoxy & Catholicism, sort ""toevah"" 
into two Greek terms, ANOMIA (violations of law or justice) & BDELYGMA 
(""infringements of ritual purity or monotheistic worship""), and use the
latter to characterize ""abomination"" and ""detestable act"", thus clearly
indicating that Christian translators & editors believed that ritual
purity and not morality was at stake.
In addition, the OT counted for little as a source for a detailed moral
code in the early (& even later) church.  Christ's ""new dispensation""
annulling the ""old law"" was taken seriously.  Also, by the 2nd century,
most Christian converts weren't Jewish, and belonged to cultures many
of whose most widespread customs were ""toevah"", such as eating pork &
shellfish & bloody meat, cutting beard & hair, clothing oneself in more
than one type of fabric at a time, practicing hybridization, etc.
In fact, Mosaic Law was felt to be so burdensome that as early as circa
49 AD, the Council of Jerusalem decided only four OT prohibitions bound
gentile Christians, namely to
	abstain from idol offerings & from blood & from what is stran-
	gled & from immorality.
			      Acts 21:25 (C - the Confraternity Edition)
Some have used this passage homophobically: but neither ""idol offerings""
(""pollutions of idols"" in KJV), referring to the eating of food offered
to idols, nor ""immorality"" (""fornication"" in KJV) refer to homosexuality.
""Fornication"", Latin ""fornicatio"", a precise term in moral theology,
from Greek ""porneia"", is nearly always distinguished from homosexuality.
In fact, the Latin term referred exclusively to heterosexual acts.  And
while ""porneia"" is somewhat ambiguous in Greek, ""it is clearly distinct
from 'bdelygma'"" {103}, under which Leviticus categorizes homosexual acts.
To sum up, the Levitical prohibition of homosexual acts is NOT tantamount
to a condemnation of them as inherently wrong.  And by the second century
AD, it was largely irrelevant to the mass of Christian converts.
[For Boswell on Leviticus & Acts, see pages 100-106.  Appendix 1, ""Lexico-
graphy & Saint Paul"", 335-353, analyzes in detail key terms in NT passages
alleged to condemn homosexual persons or acts.]

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the
above advice.  With a friend like you....(1/2 smiley face here)

Sour grapes here?  You should abstain from telling people to abstain
& continue the discussion so you can read my posting in the near fu-

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays.

 professor (at a tender 37 years of age) of history at Yale.]

			PART TWO
        These four hypothetical criticisms may reflect an uneasy feeling 
readers have, which may be expressed as follows: ""Isn't Boswell merely
putting the best face on a (very) bad picture?  Isn't the book so much
whistling in the dark?""  Boswell thinks these qualms arise from a mis-
understanding of the relation between religion and ""eros"" (erotic or
romantic love, either heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, as opposed
sex subordinated to familial interests).  The particular situation of
the modern West, a secular culture in which sex sells ideas as well as
material goods, has affected even the perceptions of historians (even
today societies differ widely: Iran, Zambia, & the USSR are decidedly
nonerotic: media, literature, opinion & daily life reveal little interest
in any form of eros; yet 13th-century Iran & 19th-century Russia were
both intensely erotic & religious).  He described two syndromes that
scholarship has displayed:
1. The ""Why are there so many divorces?"" view, which overlooks genera-
   lizations by focussing too strongly on details.  In fact, there were
   many more broken homes in 1900 because more parents abandoned child-
   ren or died in childbirth.  But the turn-of-the-century US was a
   relatively nonerotic culture.  Compared to other EROTIC cultures,
   we don't have more divorces today; the higher divorce rate results
   from making romantic fulfillment rather than the establishment of
   families the goal of relationships.
   An instance of this view occurs when scholars attempt to explain
   the origins of the centuries-old Western preoccupation with roman-
   tic love.  They trace it to the institution of ""courtly love"" prac-
   ticed by medieval troubadours, yet are bewildered: why did it begin
   then & so abruptly & without precedent in the unerotic Middle Ages?
   Boswell says ""courtly love"" seems problematic only because the pre-
   ceding medieval centuries were so unerotic, and that culture had
   begun a shift back toward an interest in eros that had characterized
   the ancient West.
2. ""Christianity gave eros a poisoned drink"" (Nietzsche).  This view
   admits that Christianity has seemingly accomodated much of exist-
   ing erotic life but only to ultimately control, limit & rob it of
   meaning.  Boswell cites his own book's findings to contradict this
   view.
In fact, Christianity, like other world religions, has displayed a
varying attitude to eros.  Boswell listed four variations, found also
in these other religions:
1. Indifference, by far the most common attitude.  Religions are no-
   toriously very conservative culturally in that they cling to their 
   ""initial environments"" long after these have ceased to have any 
   social reality.  Christianity was born (legitimized) during a major
   shift in Western culture (in the 4th century) from an erotic to a
   nonerotic society.
2. Hostility, the next most common.  While Christianity as a whole has
   never been hostile to eros as whole, it's had its share of Khomeini's.
Boswell thinks these two attitudes largely suffice to explain the per-
manence of Christian homophobia once it was officially adopted in the
13th century.  An institution which was always largely indifferent would
never feel moved to suppress expressions of homophobia, which would occur
occasionally as minority or crank opinion even before 1200.
To emphasize how indifference and marginal hostility can interact to
produce results utterly divorced from the moral teachings of scripture,
Boswell outlined how misogyny became church principle & practice.

HOMOSEXUALS MAY RISK WEAK IMMUNITY  by Jon White
    Practices common among homosexuals may weaken their immune system, creating
an abnormality seen in AIDS patients, a study published Friday in the Journal
of the American Medical Association suggested.
    Another report in the Journal noted that 38 people have developed AIDS
following blood transfusions.
    The study lends support to the theories mtying homosexual practices to a
breakdown in immunity that causes AIDS.
    AIDS is aquired immunity deficiency syndrome, a condition in which a
person's normal body defenses against infection fail to function adaquately.
Patients with AIDS can become ill and die from infections that are easily
controlled by the immune systems of healthy people.  AIDS patients may also
develop cancers rarely seen in the general population.
    Since it was first seen by physicians in 1980, AIDS has been diagnosed
mostly in homosexual men, people who use intravenous drugs illegally, and,
to a lessor extent, Haitians and hemophiliacs.  It has been noted that homo-
sexuals with a high number of partners seenm to beat greater risk of AIDS than
those with fewer partners.
    The latest AIDS study, conducted at M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston,
found that even in men without symptoms of disease, anal intercourse is
associated with abnormalities of the immune system.
    The study, conducted by Dr. Giora mavligit and colleagues, focused on 30
asymptomic, monogamously paired homosexual men.  Nineteen of 26 men who were
recipiants of sperm anally showed laboratory evidence of an immune response
to their partner's sperm.
    No evidence of such a response was found in the four men in the study
who never received sperm during intercourse.
    The response in some of the men involved infection fighters called T-cells
and was the same kind of reation strongly associated with AIDS.  The
researchers also studied one heterosexual couple who regularly practice anal
intercourse and found signs of the same immune reaction in the female.
    These findings support the theory that sperm entering the the anal canal
are readily absorbed into a person's lymphatic and blood circulation systems,
where they may set up an immune response as if they were invading infectious
agents.

I cannot help but feel that there is a subtle ""political"" component in
the AMA article linking certain sexual practices with laboratory immune
deficiency disorders, and extrapolating that to the AIDS syndrome.  A bit
exaggerated, the argument goes as follows:
	""Subjects who participate in generally-considered-icky sexual
	practices show laboratory evidence of immune response to their
	partner's sperm.  Did someone say 'immune'?  Doesn't AIDS have to
	do with the immune system?  Could it be that people who engage in
	such vile practices might actually be bringing it upon themselves?
	Hear ye, and repent now.""
It reminds me a bit of Susan Sontag's expositions of the treatment of
tuberculosis and cancer patients in her book, ""Illness as Metaphor"".  The
chasm between labortatory-level immune system peculiarities and AIDS is
quite wide, especially given the epidemiological evidence which would seem
to implicate an infectious agent as the cause of AIDS.  We must remember
that the accused practice has been around for many millenia, as opposed to
AIDS, which has emerged only in the last three years.  
A similar study was published a few years ago implicating vasectomies in
auto-immune diseases.  In this case, men were showing symptoms of immune
reactions against their own sperm.  Now the researchers (presumably
themselves intact) weren't saying much about vasectomies and AIDS then, but
they were warning of arthritis and heart disease.  The fears stirred up by
that potboiler are only beginning to be dispelled by hard evidence showing
no increase in either disease in vasectomized men.
I should emphasize that I am not condemning basic research of any kind.
But a study's conclusions and presentations are not immune (sorry) to
deeply-ingrained bias.  Here, I'm trying to point out the ur-message
I see hiding beneath the respectable mantle of an AMA article.

One wonders why the Soviets would care whether such footage was

any sense to control it or not.

There you go again, Tim.  There is absolutely no relation between the
situations in the U. S. and the Soviet Union.  Neither the U. S.
government, nor state or local governments, have attempted to curtail
your rights to distribute literature.  The only question is whether
the owner of private property should be able to outlaw the distribution of
literature (political or otherwise) on their property.  My opinion is that,
with only a few exceptions, they can.  Should you have the right to distribute
literature in a hardware store or barber shop if the owner objects.  No!
If it were my hardware store, and you were disturbing customers, I would
gladly call the cops.  This has nothing to do with the content of your
literature.  In contrast, on a public street, you are
perfectly free to distribute literature, provided you don't harass people
or block streets or building entrances.
	The only question, then, is whether a shopping mall is analagous
to a store, or to a public thoroughfare.  My personal opinion is that
it is more like a public thoroughfare and you should be able to distribute
literature.  However, this is a point upon which reasonable people can
disagree.  I understand the mall owner's point of view.  You make it
sound like ""powerful economic interests"" are trying to suppress dissent.
NO!!!  They are just trying to maximize the number of customers who shop
in their mall.  Must your rather peculiar political biases cloud
your judgment in everything?
	I'm not sure I would defend Prudential's right to arrest you
for distributing literature in a shopping mall, but I would strongly
support their right to do so in the Prudential Building.

	I find it simply incredible that a person with any conception
of reality in the Soviet Union could write the above.  There is absolutely
nothing in common between the policies governing dissent in the Soviet
Union and the laws that prohibit trespassing in the United States.  They
are completely alien to one another in origin, purpose, and effect. 
	The implicit comparison between pamphleteers in our malls and
the residents of the Gulag is sickening, and only belittles the plight
of Soviet prisoners of conscience.

The US government most certainly *is* curtailing my right to distribute
literature when its police authority is used to prevent my
exercise of that right.  Just as the governmental authorities in the
past used their authority to shoot and kill strikers.  Just as 
employees in the past were prevented from distributing union literature
in the workplace.  After a long struggle unions finally obtained both
the legally recognized right to strike and the right to distribute
literature in the workplace without retribution.  When Solidarity
tries to distribute literature in the workplace in Poland this is
hailed as a movement towards democracy. Suddenly it is *not* a movement
towards democracy to grant similar rights against private employers
in the US?
In the Soviet Union the argument is that all property, including Red Square,
is ""owned by the State"".  Since the State owns the property it has the
right to prevent people from exercising their democratic rights.
Tell me how this is any different than saying that simply because
a public shopping mall which holds community events such as
""Crime Prevention Day"" or ""Picatiny Arsenal Day"" is privately owned,
that therefore citizens lose all democratic rights.
Moreover imagine what happens when there *is no town square* or
public place except for the mall - what freedoms are left?

This is precisely how the courts have ruled that people have the right
to distribute literature in a given case.  The judgment according to
numerous court rulings in New Jersey is that as long as it can be
established as a ""question of fact"" that a mall is in fact a public
place similar in function to the town square of the past then 
people have the right to distribute literature as you suggest.
Moreover the mall must have become the major locus of community events.
The mall in which I was threatened with arrest is quite explicit in its 
claims, its name is ""Rockaway TOWN SQUARE Mall"". 
This mall 
has an annual exhibition from the Picatinny Arsenal, which makes
components for nuclear weapons.  The next week there were such 
community events planned as a ""Crime Prevention Day"", a ""Ladies Group""
and so forth.  If this mall can sponsor community events such as
a massive exhibition of propaganda for the military industrial complex
then surely the other side has the right to be heard.

Explain to me how having an exhibition glorifying military hardware
brings more customers than an exhibition celebrating Peace.
Moreover please explain to me how the present rigidly controlled
atmosphere of the shopping malls attracts more shoppers than would be
attracted if shopping malls instead allowed the sort of freedoms of
town squares for amateur musicians, puppeteers, and other artists
to entertain people freely.  The mentality of control by the corporate
owners of shopping malls is no different than the ridiculous mentality
of control demonstrated in ""Russia- Love it or Leave it"" in which
harmless and creative acts by individuals are suppressed for no
other reason than to exert control.  It is not even a question
of being a political threat, it is simply a matter of control
for malls to suppress not only the circulation of petitions but the
sort of free-spirited artistic creativity which used to be a normal
part of the town square.  I have taken some efforts to go to 
Greenwich Village many times to enjoy the street musicians and
other creative artists.  I deliberately avoid malls because they
offer no such creativity or spontaneity- not only do they not offer
such creativity they deliberately suppress it.  
Is this the sort of country we wish to become?

I agree with you on that point except for the right of employees 
in the Prudential Building to distribute literature to their
coworkers.  I am not arguing that anyone has the right to barge
in on private property under all circumstances.  What I am
arguing is precisely what the New Jersey courts have argued -
that in cases in which shopping malls have replaced town squares
as the locus of community events, in which shopping malls deliberately
sponsor community events and seek to be seen as the major public
place in a community (i.e. like Rockaway TOWN SQUARE Mall) that
the protection of our democratic rights means that people must have
the right to petition and distribute literature.  If not we
will wind up with a nation in which malls have replaced town squares
but allowed for none of the democratic rights of such town squares.
And so goes our democracy.

Jim, I am not saying that our country is currently equivalent to the
Soviet Union.  I noted that after a letter from an ACLU lawyer that
the mall in New Jersey apologized.  We *do* still have a rule of law
roughly based upon the Constitution. I would like to maintain that
system. Don't you?
 
However that should not blind us to possible threats to our
democratic rights.  Nor is it true that every transgression in the
Soviet Union leads to a Gulag.  In fact, if you had seen the Frontline
show ""Russia - Love it or Leave it"" you would know that while the
peace activist was arrested for distributing literature that at
the time of the TV interview she was living peacefully at home amidst
her Nuclear Freeze bumperstickers.  She was not sent to a Gulag anymore
than I would have been had I been arrested.  That does not mean
that she was not intimidated and prevented from exercising her rights.
Every day another shopping mall is built - in some newly built suburbs
there never is a town square since the shopping mall serves its
function from the beginning.  In other areas, the traditional town
square and its business district dies as the shopping mall replaces it.
In many communities, particularly in the New Jersey suburbs, the
shopping mall *IS* the locus of public activity and community events.
Shopping Malls have Boy Scout events, exhibits from local military
arsenals, and other ""community"" events.   They are *the only place*
where the public can go see such events and they are the locus of
community activities in exactly the same fashion as town squares.
In order to distribute political literature one does not do well in
a closet.  Nor is this any democratic ""freedom"" of any consequence
to be free to distribute literature in a closet.  The Soviet peace
activist had no trouble being arrested for her Nuclear Freeze 
bumpersticker in her own apartment.  She got in trouble for trying
to disseminate her views in public; rights guaranteed by the Helsink
Accords and the Univeral Bill of Rights.
If present trends continue then in many places there will be no
public town squares, only shopping malls.  What will become of
*our* political rights guaranteed under our own Constitution if
there is no place to distribute literature to the public?  If one
is simply not allowed to distribute literature where the public
actually congregates?  We will wind up with repression of democratic
rights similar to the Soviet Union, in which distributing literature
is to court arrest.  It does not matter to me if such repression
in our own country is based upon the rights of *private* property
while in the Soviet Union it is based upon the rights of *public*
property.  The end result is the same loss of democratic rights.
Nor does it matter to me if in our own country the punishment is
less severe - arrest and possible loss of a job versus eventually
being sent to a Gulag in the Soviet Union.  The denial of
civil liberties is wrong. Period.

You grant permission to the owner of the shopping mall to control the right
of free speech. The owner is not even forced to justify the dominion: ""He
owns the building and wants to maximize profit"" -- that simple fact is
enough for you to accept the domination.
Your proposed union of freedom and servitude is dismanteling to human
rights and cannot possibly be in the interest of a free society.
If this is whats happening: The corporations that own places of public
interest can judge at will which civil rights they allow the people to
exercise and which not -- then there is something wrong with that kind
of ownership and corporations should not be allowed to do so.
We are not talking about some weired, radical or life threatening behavior
on part of the public here. We are talking about something as simple
as distributing flyers.
If this, however, interferes with the interest of the owner of the
shopping mall, then those interests are to be questioned -- not the
civil rights!

It's very different, because there is only one state, but many mall owners.

Do you know the facts of this case? Because I expected to encounter a
hassle from the mall management and the police I brought with me copies
of several court rulings from various malls in New Jersey.  That
didn't matter one whit to the police officer OR the management.
In order to protect my civil rights do I have to go into court umpteen
million times?  Another mall had *already* been successfully sued
for preventing the Passaic County Nuclear Freeze from distributing
literature.  That didn't matter - they booted me out but said I could
call to get a table.  I was suspicious but willing to go along with 
their restrictions.  So what happens?
1)the management can hardly be tracked down to reserve a table.
  Finally to resolve the issue a Freeze member took 3 hours off of
  work and planted herself in the manager's office until she would
  talk to her
2)the Freeze member said she wanted a table for the next weekend:
  sorry, the manager said, but you *MUST* reserve the table for the
  whole week
3)OK, the Freeze member said, we want a table for the whole week
  sorry, the manager said, but you must reserve the table for the
  whole week thirty days in advance
4)OK, the Freeze member said, we would like to reserve the table for
  the whole week thirty days from now
  sorry, the manager said, but you must send me a letter on your
  organization's letterhead stationery and THEN I can send you
  an application. (thereby meaning another two week delay while
  the ""official letterhead"" stationery from the Freeze is processed
  and then an application (maybe) is returned from the mall, which
  then must be sent back again
5)OK, the Freeze member said, we don't have ""official letterhead""
  stationery but we will make some and send you a letter requesting
  an application for a table. By this time it will have to be for
  November or December.
  sorry, the manager said, but you can NOT reserve a table at ANY TIME
  during November and December because of the Christmas rush

It is hardly irrelevant when talking about the denial of current civil
rights and the threat this may pose in the future to point out that
such things have happened in the past.  Most Americans are never
taught the history of the labor struggle in this country.  How
company towns controlled every aspect of people's lives and made a profit
on every aspect of their lives.  For example, one company town paid their
workers with scrip that could *only* be used in company stores.
How workers were shot and killed in
the defense of the rights of private property. How workers were fired
and worse for distributing pro-union literature on private property.
During the Palmer Raids unionists and socialists were rounded up
and arrested for ""subversion"".  Many were placed in prisons for years.
During the McCarthy era many people were fired and blacklisted
for simply *knowing* somebody who was a Communist or leftist.
 
The replacement of public town squares with privately owned malls
poses the same challenge again: which will be respected, people's
basic civil rights of freedom of speech or the rights of private
property?
I believe in the end that this country *will* follow its deep
democratic traditions and protect people's rights to freedom of
speech over private property's rights of repression.  Just as
we finally did in respecting workers' rights to distribute literature
on private property and workers rights to strike.
But it will not happen without effort.  And it is part of the
ongoing struggle to increase democracy as was done during the union
movement and the civil rights movement. THAT is why history is relevant.

First off, let me say that I think we are in basic agreement on what
people's rights *should* be with regard to distributing literature
on private property.  Namely that people have this right not for all
private property but only when private property such as malls is
a public thoroughfare which serves as a community center and hosts
community events in the same manner as town squares.
I am glad that you agree with me on this.
 
On your objection to my raising the mall issue, I think you fail to see
my underlying point.  At NO TIME have I ever said that the US is
*equivalent* to the Soviet Union in terms of civil rights.  Even the
Palmer Raids, which were crass and overt violations of civil rights,
were a cakewalk compared to Stalin's massacres.  Moreover while most
Americans have forgotten how many workers were killed trying to establish
basic union rights, the right to grievance procedures and so forth,
such killings also come nowhere close to Stalin's killings. I am not
about to justify Stalin's policies.  At the same time, one must recognize
that Stalin has been dead for 30 years now.  The instruments of repression
in the Soviet Union no longer include the wholesale slaughter of Stalinism.
Instead they include summary arrest, the use of mental hospitals and
generalized censorship.  They also include restrictions on people's
rights to distribute literature in public places.
 
The American media is quite prolific and repetitive in pointing out
this restriction in the Soviet Union.  One can never see a documentary
on the Soviet Union which does not mention restrictions on people's
civil rights.  The presumption of course is that the United States
has NO such problems.  This presumption is *wrong*.
That is my point.
Yet the mainstream American media never point this out. If you live
in a suburb in which the mall is the community center in general
you do NOT have the right to distribute literature.  The New Jersey
Nuclear Freeze has found this problem in every mall we have ever
approached in this state.  It has only been pressure and actual
lawsuits which have forced some malls to change this policy.
Even then, as with Willowbrook Mall, they impose such restrictions
on literature distribution as to make it almost impossible to
actually practice one's right to distribute literature.
Certainly we should criticize other nation's restrictions of
civil rights.  But should the American media simply ignore
similar restrictions in our own country?  Isn't it even 
more important to uphold basic civil liberties in our own country
before criticizing others? If we do not respect civil liberties
in our own country then how can we pretend to be concerned about
such restrictions by other countries?
My point is that while criticizing other countries, we should not
pretend that we are a Utopian, ""holier-than-thou"" perfect nation.
Such an attitude promotes the oft-repeated chauvinist strategy of
painting the enemy as the devil and one's own country as God's
angel.  Thus justifying any atrocity which may be committed or
planned against the ""devilish"" opponent.
For instance:
  ""I have just signed legislation which outlaws Russia forever.
   The bombing starts in five minutes.""

Sorry, but there is a great deal of difference between the freedom given
to Solidarity (or lack thereof) and the freedom given to US citizens, to
distribute literature.  The reason distribution of literature by Solidarity
is considered democratic is that the government of Poland controls, in 
general, all the people's sources of information.  Am independent source
of information, such as the literature, is therefore a move by Solidarity
towards democracy.  In the US, if the organizations prohibited from
distributing literature in the mall were also prohibited from distributing
their literature everywhere else, the situation would be analogous to that
in Poland.  But the US government does not have total control of the media,
and unlike Solidarity, the pamphlet distributers DO have ways to legally
give their pamphlets out.  Poland is controlling what can be distributed,
while the US is only controlling where it can be distributed.

It is different because in the USSR, the state has a monopoly on ownership
of the property.  Privately owned property in the US is not all owned by
the same person--the pamphleteers can go somewhere else, to find someone who
will allow use of their property, and if they have property available to
them, they can use their own property.  In the USSR, the state is the only
game in town, and if the state says you can't do something, you can't try
to do it somewhere else.  And just because someone allows one group
(i.e. supporters of the Crime Prevention program) to use their property
doesn't mean they have to let everyone use their property--it's their
property, and they can decide what to do with it.
>Moreover imagine what happens when there *is no town square* or
>public place except for the mall - what freedoms are left?
Forcing the mall owners to allow pamphleteers to distribute material is
also depriving freedoms--the freedoms of the owners to not be forced into use
of their property for a cause that they do not support.
If you can't give out literature in one place, that doesn't mean your views
are being suppressed.  If there is ""no public place"", that would appear to
show that nobody is interested in your point of view, and you shouldn't
continue to proselytize to people who don't want to be proselytized to.
If enough people support your view, they can exert pressure on the mall owners;
in the USSR no such possibility exists.
Of course, if all the malls across the nation were owned by one company,
then the result would be significant restriction on the free speech of the
distributers of the literature.  But this is NOT the case in the US and IS
the case in the USSR--except the state is the ""company"" and it controls not
only malls, but radio, TV, books, newspapers, etc....
>Explain to me how having an exhibition glorifying military hardware
>brings more customers than an exhibition celebrating Peace.
You can't say that your exhibition is celebrating peace and someone else's
is not.  Rather, the other party believes peace can be achieved in one manner
and you believe peace must be achieved in a different manner.  The other
party may be wrong in thinking that military expenditures bring peace,
but that doesn't mean they don't support peace, just that they're wrong about
the methods necessary.
The reason the military exhibition brings more customers is that more customers
believe that the other people's methods will bring peace than believe that
yours do.

>atmosphere of the shopping malls attracts more shoppers than would be

Because the shoppers disagree with certain beliefs and don't want to be prosely-
tized.  The question here is not music or art, but politics.  And even in the
case of truly non-political artists, just because the mall owners and the 
townspeople decide that one should be allowed, that doesn't mean they have to
let everyone.

I think that Tim failed to discuss one of the most serious civil
right violation in the USSR.  The USSR severely restricts the
right of its people to emigrate.  If you don't like the US,
you can leave the country.  There are many oppressive governments
on this planet.  Yet, when it comes to emigration, the USSR and 
its satellite nations are at the top of the list.  Basically,
the USSR can be viewed as a giant prison camp for its people.

You have a valid point, although I think it is not true that the
USSR can be viewed as simply a giant prison camp for its people.
I support the right of all Soviets to freely emigrate, if they wish.
Perhaps (??) the release of Shcharansky indicates a future opening of
Soviet emigration policy.  But there has been no evidence of that as yet.
But again, let me point out that my point was hardly to *condone* Soviet
human rights abuses of all sorts - my point was that if we do not
watch out we will wind up with a similar situation in our own country.
Distibuting literature at shopping malls has been treated as a ""trivial""
problem.  But I do not think it is when also considered in conjunction
with the blatant censorship of the press during Grenada, in conjunction
with forced lie detector tests in the highest levels of government,
in conjunction with FCC policies which threaten to allow media monopolies
throughout the country, in conjunction with attempts to make all government
employees take an oath that they would *never* reveal what they had
learned in office, even after leaving office.
Another very real threat is the enormous increase in research and development
spending for the military on classified projects which Star Wars threatens
to increase to even larger proportions.  As part of this militarization
of research more and more restrictions are being placed upon rights to
publish and basic academic freedoms.
The point is to *avoid* becoming another Soviet Union, not to
""defend ourselves"" by simply becoming like the Soviet Union ourselves.

That's what _I_ was taught in school.  What they didn't teach us (and I
had to find out by my own reading) was that labor unions weren't just
victims -- there were times that they *started* the violence by dynamiting
the barracks of non-union labor brought in to replace union laborers.
I'm sure Tim has all sorts of excuses for labor unions killing people
(after all, Tim believes in PEACE), but the fact remains: labor disputes
had plenty of violence on both sides, and I wouldn't get too much of a
""holier-than-thou"" tone about it.
Remember: a labor union is more properly termed ""labor monopoly"".  A group
of laborers attempt to restrict supply of a commodity (labor) in order to
drive up the price of the commodity (wages).  It is not surprising that
labor unions in a free market have a hard (perhaps impossible) time 
monopolizing the labor supply, for the same reason that companies in a 
free market have a hard (perhaps impossible) time monopolizing a market.
It is also not surprising that labor unions resorted to violence and
intimidation, much like some of the robber barons of the last century did.
What IS unacceptable is to claim that only businesses used violence to
achieve their ends.  What IS unacceptable is to ignore how widespread
union violence is today to intimidate employers into giving in (sabotage,
tampering with Hormel meat products, hiring sharpshooters to blow out
utility company transformers) and to coerce workers into joining a union
or supporting a strike.
Tim, go ahead and deny it happens.  (Hitler's Big Lie technique is firmly
in use by socialists and unionists today.)  It happens every single day
in this country.  The U.S. Supreme Court found the use of sharpshooters
to destroy transformers ""a legitimate collective bargaining technique""
in 1973.  My father was a union man and knew well what would happen if
he were to cross a picket line.  The lies that labor unions don't engage
in large scale violence TODAY don't hold anymore.

Union.  Some of you may think that my views are biased, that I am a 
""hardliner"", but here it goes.
Some of you mentioned that in the USSR all property belongs to the 
State and this is the reason why the State ""has the right to prevent 
people from exercising their democratic rights"".  By the Soviet law, 
everything in the USSR belongs to the people, including the State 
itself!  Preventing people from distributing any kind of literature is 
a violation of this law.  But this is on a side note.  The main issue 
is, of course, the absolute irrelevance of comparison between a 
shopping mall and the Soviet state.
I came to the USA with the only purpose: to be free.  Free from the 
government intervention in my business, whether commercial or 
political.  So, if I buy or lease a store at a mall, I expect that 
nobody tells me what to do there.  Including my right to set the rules 
in the store.  And if I don't anybody distributing literature there, I 
have a right to have the police to protect my property because all I 
want is profit.  If I own a mall or a corporation, I should expect to 
have similar rights.  IT IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.  I may exaggerate a 
little, but that is my way of thinking.  But it is way overboard to say 
that in order to have a right to free speech Tim Sevener has to own a 
mall...
What many of you didn't realize about distributing literature on Red 
Square is the following:  The authorities are not concerned about 
distributing Soviet literature.  They are afraid of distributing 
""non-approved"" literature, ""samisdat"" or something smuggled from the 
West.  That's why they first grab the people there and then see who 
they got and for what.  The authorities are really scared of this kind 
of literature, because it may contain the facts that are kept secret 
for the Soviet public.  Do you know, for instance, that in order to 
make a Photostat copy of any document one has to get to authorizing 
signatures?  And this is at work, there are no copiers in libraries, 
post offices and such.  
As far as American media's interpretation of the Soviet life is 
concerned, after living in Moscow for 30 years, I know and said it 
many times that life there is worse then you see it on TV here.

Is this question supposed to be serious or rhetorical? After all, it is
pretty obvious that exhibits of militaria attract a lot of people. Kids
love to clamber over tanks and play with artillery and sit in cockpits
and vehicles. This brings along their parents, who are potential
customers, as are the kids themselves and anybody else who came to see the
exhibits. Maybe other exhibits would attract more than these; it is now
up to you to design and produce one, and make it available to the mall
owners. If it does attract more, they'll be happy to provide space.
What *are* you going to exhibit to ""celebrate Peace"", though?
Reproductions of famous treaties? A mess of doves? A blacksmith beating
swords into plowshares?
For what it's worth, though, I agree that malls should be treated like
public streets, in terms of political access. Just because they are
under a roof, and the trash collection is handled by a private party
instead of a municipality, doesn't change their essential character,
which is a direct descendent of the community ""shopping district"" or
""business district"", and whose roles the mall has usurped.

No, because the mall owners, etc... don't all make same resrictions.  Surely
there's a mall somewhere which has an owner who would allow you to give out
pamphlets.  Or if not, an organization somewhere which will let you use its
facilities to give out pamphlets.  Or, for that matter, a street corner, park,
etc... where you can legally give out pamphlets.  In the USSR the state
controls everything.  There's a great difference between not being allowed
to do something everywhere and not being allowed to do it anywhere.

1)in the United States so far as I know there are no towns totally
  owned and controlled by the State (unless you wish to count
  military bases, which actually generally come under separate and
  independent municipal jurisdictions)
 
2)there were no elections to determine either officials or policies
  of  company towns when they existed. The company, usually owned and
  controlled by either one family or one person, determined everything
  autocratically.  Such is *not* the case with local governments.
  Even if they may be controlled by elites, they at least must face
  elections.  Many machines have lost their power by being voted out
  of office. (e.g. Daley's previously invincible machine lost the
  mayor's office)

I don't disagree with Tim that there those who would like to restrict
our freedom in the US.  Tim is pointing mostly in the direction of
the military establishment, but I feel that if there is a danger, it
comes from the religious right.  I think it is possible to make intersting
analogies between the Soviet communists and the fundamentalist
religionist in the US.  You just have to substitute ""Marxism, Leninism""
dogma by ""Bible, God"" dogma, and you will see what I mean.  Reagan
and others try to portray the US, that unlike the atheistic USSR, 
has the Bible and God on our side. In contrast, Gorbachev would justify
his actions as Marxist Leninist.  The emphasize on the distinction between 
the US and the USSR should be on freedom and the lack of freedom, rather
on dogmatic differences. 
Back to your point.  I think trying to equate the present condition in
the US to the USSR is an offense against human intelligence.  Naturally,
there some who would like to transform this country to a totaliterian
system,  but excluding a terrible catastrophe, I feel they would have
a difficult time achieving their goal.

No, Tim.  You don't have to own a mall.  There are still public areas that
are accessible, even if only a curbside on the approach to the mall.  What,
you say that no one will bother to stop their car and read your petition?
Too bad.  These are private citizens choosing to take their commerce to a
specific place; most of them are fully aware that a mall is private property.
There is no law *forcing* people to spend some of their time on public
property just so every organization can make the most of its free speech.
Those who seek this (such as you) can choose to boycott malls, for example.
If there are enough of you, malls will wither and downtown squares will
prosper again.  Or, you can attempt to reach people in other ways: mailings,
telephone calls, door-to-door visits.  You can invite everyone to *your*
home and have no restrictions on who sets up tables or gives out flyers.
The point is still that malls are private property, used as the owner sees
fit.  Having a significant portion of the ""community life"" happen at a mall
doesn't require the owner to relinquish property rights.  After all, in
some communities the church building is an important location for social
intercourse.  Should a synagogue have to provide ""equal time"" for the KKK
once it allows B'nai B'rith, for example?
Of course, this whole issue is separate from the story of how property
was allocated in the first place.  But most of American society (and all
of American jurisprudence) accept the concept of private property, so it
looks like we'll have to take that as a given.

------------------
A dastardly right-wing plot to stifle dissent has been uncovered
by super-sleuth Tim Sevener.  At a secret meeting, Ronald Reagan,
Edward Meese, Jerry Falwell, Jesse Helms, Secretary of Defense
Weinberger, and former Interior Secretary James Watt have agreed
to build a large shopping mall covering the entire country.  The
shopping mall would then be sold for one dollar to Ed Meese, who
would then prosecute anyone distributing unauthorized literature

There is a very important distiction between a private citizen's house and
a corporate mall. A corporation is an artificial entity the owners of which
(shareholders) are protected from any legal action from private people.
The corporation is a creation of the state, it has a charter from the state,
therefore it should be subject to the same cival rights requirements that
apply to the state.

I would notice that synagogue is a meeting place of a specific religious
community, and not explicitely open to the general public, like a mall.
The shop interior is designated for people to come and shop, but the
main alley of a mall does not have this specific character.
If we provide examples, I also will give one.  I live in a complex
of 40+ appartment houses owned by a single company.  Would it be
right for the management to request asking their prior permition
before canvassing the appartments to solicit donations?  Would it
be right for the management to throw out a girl scout or a proseliting
Mormon?  Or a peace activist?
By the way, what is the status of the parking lots of shopping plazas,
which are the favorite places in my semi-rural community for people
collecting donations?
If their status is the same as of the interior of a mall, then I think
that my rights are seriously courtailed.  Why should I be forced to
communicate with pamphleteerers only when I am driving, and when
I need to obstruct the trafick to stop my car?
Bob ignores the reality in most of American communities, where we usually
are either driving, or we walk on some private property.  If a place
is designated for walking for the general public, it should be treated
equally as a public sidewalk or alley.  Otherwise some of the rights
of the general public are curtailed.
When Tim is thrown out of a mall, not only his rights are abused, but
also the rights of people who would gladly pick a leaflet or tell him
that the peace movement is dumb; an activity which is an obvious right
on a street of a city.

Mr. Foy is here rebutting the idea that the owner of a mall should be
able to refuse entrance to pests, just as the owner of a home can, since
a corporation it subject to the same...[see above].
Note that Mr. Foy, who works for Aerospace Corporation, states, in effect,
that Aerospace Corp. cannot refuse entrance to pests; that if it allows
customers to come in and do business with it, then it must allow
the general public to come in and distribute literature.

Are you saying that if an individual builds a mall, then he should
be able to keep people he doesn't like out, but a corporation
(even if 100% owned by the same individual) cannot do this?
My own feeling on this is that a mall owner should be able to restrict
political activity (and other non-shopping activities), but that there
should definitely be something like the ""Equal Access"" for political
broadcast ads -- if one group is let in, then others should be let
in under similar conditions.  Or no political groups could be let in.
I believe that our freedom of religion needs us to allow churches
and other similar situations to be exempt, in that a synagogue does
not have to allow the KKK equal time.  However, if a Seventh-Day
church is rented out to another congregation on Sunday, should
they be forced to rent it out on Monday as well (even if the Monday
people were Satanists?)

Actually, a better response would be to eliminate laws that provide
corporations with a special legal status and special legal privileges.
If people wish to deal with a company under those terms that are currently
in force for dealing with corporations, they should be free to agree with the
company to do so, but there should not be any special priveliges granted to
corporations by legal edict.  Note, many of the terms under which corporations
operate, such as limited liability, are dicounted by those who deal with them
anyway.

If a significant percentage of people who avail themselves of malls wish
to see the dissemination of such literature, mall owners will have no choice
but to oblige them, or see business go elsewhere.  If very few people care,
well, that's democracy in action.  It seems to me that you so often sing

It is not clear that it is necessary to be ""where the public congregates""
in order to reach it.  Modern telecommunications technology has provided
means to communicate easily with masses of people, such as cable television,
this and other networks.  There may well be other means that have occurred to
neither you nor I.

The real distinction is this:  There are (for the sake of simplification)
two types of property.  The first type is private property controlled by
an individual.  By this I mean things like my car, my house, my personal
tools, etc, that I actually use.  It also includes my means of production
if I am an individual producer.  For example, it would include my dental
tools and office equipment if I were a dentist.  In a very real sense I
can be said to own and operate this property personally.
The second type is what I will call social property.  A good example is
a steel mill.  I can't operate a steel mill all by myself.  A steel mill
has value and utility only if there is an organization to operate it.
The same is true of a shopping mall.  No one ""owns"" a shopping mall in
the sense that they ""own"" their house.  The important thing about social
property is that there must be organizations to operate it, and, in all
but very primitive societies, the rules under which these organizations
operate and exist are defined by the society as a whole.  The debate
between the proponents of classical capitalism and those of socialism
can be viewed as one about the ""best"" approach towards regulating the
control and operation of social property.
In my opinion it is an error to confuse the two.  Claims that forced
permission of leaflet distribution in shopping malls are the same kind
of thing as giving the general public the right to enter my house without
my permission are misleading, nor is the issue one of the formal ownership
of the mall.  Mind you, I am not taking a position on either side.  I am
simply trying to dispose of some strawmen and red herrings.

   This seems a specious argument at best.  Are you saying that you have
the right to distribute literature in a mall owned by a corporation, but
not in one owned by an individual?  Why would this make a difference?
I can't believe that you think this is a relevant distinction!

The best form of democracy as I see it involves not simply rule by
the masses but protection of individual rights and civil liberties,
protection for the rights of alternative viewpoints, however repugnant,
to express themselves in public.  What is so reprehensible about the
Soviet Union and other Leninist dictatorships is that no such civil
liberties are allowed.  Dissenters have no place to dissent without
the approval of the authorities.  Let us turn your argument around,
Mike: ""if a significant percentage of the Soviet people wish to
see literature in Red Square they will press upon the Soviet authorities
for that right.""  But why should they *have* to beg askance from
the authorities?  To acknowledge such a demand in the first place is
to acknowledge that there is no room for dissemination of opinions
outside of that acceptable to the authorities.
By the same argument to say that the expression of opinions in our
own country depend upon their profitability for narrow interest groups
would mean that ""freedom of speech""  is really no such thing at all -
it would become just as dependent on the whims of authorities
(even if different authorities) as public expression in Leninist
dictatorships.
I find it incredible that ""Libertarians"" whose utmost concern is
supposedly ""freedom"" could support such repression of free speech!

Why distinguish between ""social property"" and ""personal property"" based
on whether one person can operate it or not?  Why not make the distinction
based on whether one person can *build* it?  This seems just as valid,
perhaps more so, since an automated steel mill MIGHT be operable by one
person, but would certainly require many people to build it.  This
distinction seems designed to justify the status quo concerning leafletting,
rather than a realistic basis for treating a mall differently than a
church or home.

Oh no, those evil capitalists are at it again!  
Really, one organization doesn't own all the channels of communication,
at least in the US.  (In the USSR, the situation is, of course, exactly
that--the state has a monopoly on information sources.)  Even if there
are so many ""moneyed interests"" who ""control the channels of communi-
cation"", they don't all agree with one another, so different opinions
do get expressed.

The point was that the mall managers have to respond to the shoppers' desires.
If they do not, the shoppers can shop somewhere else.  As for people supporting
the views if they don't know them, obviously they DO know at least enough
about themto not want to be exposed to them in the mall, and their desires
about this are widely enough known that the mall managers know this also.

It is possible for shoppers to dislike some types of proselytization more
than they dislike others.  That is the shoppers' right.

OK, let me clarify:  The owners don't want such use of their property
because it alienates shoppers.  Being forced to allow their property's
being used in such a manner reduces their profits from shoppers, thus
making them lose money.
I cannot imagine a shopper who buys one product in preference to another
because the product is advertised with an advertisement that says nothing
about the product itself or the product's price.  Yet such ads obviously
are effective.  Other shoppers often do things for reasons that you or I
might not.

In Bergen County Mall volunteers for a political candidate were threatened
with arrest for placing leaflets on cars in the parking lot.   Thus
mall owners would extend their censorship of free speech not just
*inside* the mall itself but to all entrances and the entire parking
lot.  The New Jersey courts decided that such a threat was an unlawful
infringement of the rights to free speech.

Several passersby, besides signing the petition I was
distributing also commended me for taking the trouble to circulate
a petition on a very important issue.  Indeed, one man said he
could not agree with my political viewpoint but that he 
supported my right to express it.  As he said, that is what is
great about America!  Ironically, a few minutes later I was

I think that there is probably a legal distinction between handing out leaflets

show the power of the lie.
Of course, truth has a power too, it just takes longer to show.
As that evil man A. Lincoln said, 'you can fool some of the people ...'
Incidentally, Tim, how do you think the Lincoln administration would
rate in terms of willingness to negotiate, freedom of the press,
repression of opposing politcal views, electoral fraud?  I'm sure
that Marcos had nothing on Abe.  That is why I refered to him as 'evil'.
Maybe we could have a human rights commission that would evaluate 
the Federal Government's behavior.  Then we could oppose that behavior
even if the South won the Civil War!  There's nothing like standing on principle, eh.
What that's you say?  You say the previous paragraph is absurd?  
It doesn't seem founded in reality.  Do I really want the South to win?

Just joking Tim, we all know that you REALLY post all these articles
to stimulate discussion.  Right?  You really don't think that if
the Communists take over the world (excepting the vile part know -
in a typically ethnocentric way - as America), right Tim?
The difference between the supression of speech in the USSR and in a  
mall is that the USSR can impose any penalty, including death if the
party (CP that is) feels like it.  What is the worst that you can 
get for tresspassing?

	Point well taken.  [Actually I don't give a damn about leafletting
in malls one way or another.]  ""Personal property"" normally has the char-
acteristic that the labor cost of bringing into existence is less than a
single persons lifetime.  However I did mean ""operate"" in a more general
sense.  Even if the steel mill is completely automated somebody has to
market the steel, somebody has to negotiate contracts for delivery of
ore to the mill and steel to the customers, etc.  Most property has the
characteristic that it has an associated function.  The distinguishing
feature of ""social property"" is that the exercise of its function requires
an organization and that its principal value is to an organization.  For
example, an office building is ""social property"".  Granted that people
could take shelter in it; however it was not designed for that and does
not serve that purpose very well.  [Obvious question -- how does one
classify an apartment building?  An army barracks?]
	One important feature of ""social property"" is that there must
be an institution associated with it -- it may be a company, a church,
a government, a club, a university, whatever.  [Yes, churches are
different from homes.]

I know because I watched the PBS Frontline show ""Russia: Love it or

watch it?  I think you would find it informative and probably
supportive of some of your views if you can get a chance to see it.

1)to gain access to electronic media in general one has to have $$$$$
  Should every political organization be rich to promote their views?
 
2)even *granted* $$$, there is no guarantee that one will be allowed to
  place critical views on the electronic media.  Helen Caldicott tried
  to place a Public Service Announcement on all 3 American networks
  (which are not *free*) and was not allowed to.
  The College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were also banned from
  placing their ad on the importance of responsibility in preventing
  pregnancies.  They took no explicit stand in favor of contraception
  or abortion but simply suggested that one should consult an
  obstetrician and carefully consider pregnancy.
 
3)I have seldom seen a representative from the Physicians for
  Social Responsibility, the Nuclear Freeze, SANE, or other peace groups
  asked to join panels commenting on speeches or programs dealing
  with the arms race.  Such panels are almost always stacked with
  members of the Foreign Policy Establishment -e.g. Kissinger,
  McNamara,etc.  While I have great respect for McNamara, his views
  hardly represent the many people involved in the Peace Movement.
 
  Thus I find it peculiarly ironic that ABC should catch flak for
  allowing Vladimir Posner to respond to Reagan's vast collection
  of lies and distortions in his defense speech.  How is it that
  a *Soviet* spokesman can get broadcast time but Randall Forsberg,
  Retired Rear Admiral Gene LaRocque, Helen Caldicott, Bernard Lown
  and other representatives of American peace groups who are
  critical of *both* sides part in the arms race can never get
  such time?  Perhaps the reason is that a Soviet's responses
  can be more easily labelled as ""propaganda"" than a response
  from *American* peace groups.

some below, as they come to me -- others may well think of still more
types, or sub-divisions of these types, as this is by no means
exhaustive. ""Proper"" or allowable or tolerable behavior may well be
different on theses different types of property. (What is ""proper"" is,
of course, determined by those with the greatest power -- usually those
that have the guns. This usually equates to those controlling the police
or army.)
Public property: The traditional city street and sidewalks. Note that
behavior on this is already restrained by ordinances regarding
traffic-blocking, permits required to set up a stand and sell goods, etc.
Municipal (public) funds pay to maintain these areas.
Public/private property: The private street, where the owners' funds pay
for the maintenance rather than municipal funds being used. Security is
provided by private guards, etc., though the municipality is called in
for serious police work or fire-fighting, etc. [I really am unsure as to
the legal status of public access to such areas. Anyone have facts on this?]
Personal private property: Owner-occupied real estate; your home. Note
that ""a man's home is his castle"" is no longer true -- occupancy
permits, laws about such things as pet ownership and smoke-alarm
installation already restrict what you do in the privacy of your own
home, even if you own the building and land. Condo association or
subdivision regulations or deed restrictions may also apply.
Rented personal private property: A home location rented from some other
person, as an apartment. Rights of occupant further restricted by lease
(either explicit or common-law).
Private business property: A factory or plant, for example, where the
general public does not have access, but which is open to the owners and
to those they have hired to work there, or contracted with for services,
or allowed access for business-related reasons (utility company people
coming in to read a meter, for example).
Limited-access public business property: A wholesale-to-the-trade
showroom, for example, to which access is granted to those persons
meeting some standard of group membership, such as ""buyer for a retail
outlet"" or ""purchaser in some quantity"". The nature of the restriction
must be posted or otherwise publicly proclaimed.
Quasi-public business property: A retail outlet, store, or service site,
where members of the public are allowed or encouraged to enter to shop
or to purchase services or inquire about such. If you enter, but do not
buy, browse, or engage in some form of trade relationship with the
proprietor, you may be legitimately requested to leave. Your presence in
this area is predicated on the presumption that you are there to trade.
Fully-public business property: The prime example is the mall, where all
this discussion originated. This is NOT the individual store or shop in
the mall, which falls under the preceeding category, but the area
outside the stores, to which access is granted the general public, in
the hope that they will in turn enter the stores to spend money. Note
that there is no requirement or contract to the effect that, once you
enter the mall, you *must* subsequently enter a mall shop to buy or
browse or otherwise interact with the actual retailer; you have a legal
right to enter this mall, even if it is private property, because it is
held out as available for access by members of the general public. You
can go and just sit, and it is legitimate. 
In the light of the above, I would equate ""public property"" with the
""fully-public business property"", in that legitimate free-speech
political actions should be allowed in both. Even though I probably
would violently disagree with everything Tim would say or the leaflets
he would distribute, I agree with him that access to this sort of area
should be allowed, despite that some person or organization happens to
own it.

I *never* claimed that the US and USSR were equivalent.  I have
enormous admiration for our freedoms and defense of people's human
rights in this country.  What I *AM* concerned about is concentrations
of power which threaten such freedoms and human rights and threaten
to make our country more and more like the Soviet Union.  I have
stated this again and again - apparently however any criticism of
disturbing trends in our own country is not tolerated by some people.
 
More disturbing is the following:

This is an age-old tactic: any criticism  of one's own country is
labelled as ""consorting with the enemy"".  This tactic *is* one which
is used in many countries, the USSR as well as the US.  The difference
as has been properly pointed out is the degree to which such attacks
result in actual repression.  In the Soviet Union one can be sent to
a Gulag for repeated dissent branded as ""unpatriotic"".  In the US
one may be sent to jail for a short legally defined term.  Unless
one is in a stage of right-wing hysteria such as McCarthyism during 
the 50's when people were systematically blacklisted for years.
Even then this is obviously better than being lined up before a
firing squad as happened in the Stalinist purges.  But is either
behavior to be condoned? I hardly think so.
Does anyone on the net?

Tim - Your basic inability to comprehend the issues involved never ceases
to amaze me.
	1) A mall is private property.  Nowhere in the constitution is
(or should it be) it stated that you have the right to distribute literature
on someone elses property without their consent.  Your ""free speech"" does
not give you the right to distribute literature in my home or my place
of business.
	2) Some (including me) believe that the unusual ""public thoroughfare""
character of shopping malls (they are like enclosed streets) makes it
desirable to allow literature distribution in malls (not in the individual
businesses) even though they are private property.  It is not at all
clear to me that this is a ""Constitutional"" right, however.  Were I on
the N. J. or N. Y. Supreme Court, I would have to think long and hard
about the matter (assuming the absence of state or local statute guaranteeing
such access to malls, or such provisions in the state constitution).  You imply:
	a) It should be obvious to anybody that the U. S. Constitution
guarantees your right to distribute literature in a mall.
	b) Anyone who doesn't agree with a) is a total idiot or an enemy
of freedom of speech.
	c) The U. S. government is oppressing you by not interfering with
the mall owner in his exercise of his perceived property rights.
	It seems obvious to me that a), b), and c) above are all ridiculous.
Do you seriously believe them?  If so, you need help.

which makes a mall a public place is that anybody is let in, and allowed to
remain, whether they have any business there or not.  (This is, in general,
only true during the hours they are open; the right of the mall owners to
close the place at night is unassailable.)  This is quite different from a
home, where the public may not enter, or a church, which is likely to let
anyone enter, but is likely to require that they participate in the service.
The right to free speech in a public place, so long as it doesn't interfere
with the owner's intended uses, is quite properly guaranteed by the courts
on the basis of the first amendment.  (The interference clause would rule
out blocking access, or setting up a loudspeaker system which interferes
with the ability of those in the stores to conduct business.)
Mr. Sevener is thus quite right to be outraged about having been denied
access to a mall for leafletting.

I did not claim that there exist a ""capitalistic conspiracy"".
However, there are poll results which exhibit that corporate officers
have in average political opinions which are much to the right of the
average of the public as a whole.  Thus the distribution of propaganda
trash like ""Plain Truth"", interprets the Bible in a way which ""shows"" that
the welfare ""against the God's law"" is much easier than the distribution
of ""peace literature"".

Sorry, but this is a peace of bullshit.  I NEVER heard about somebody who
prefers mall shopping over down-town shopping BECAUSE in a mall one is not
exposed to pamphleteers.  (Did anyone avoid some airports because of the

As I see it, the mall management should be allowed to expell people
who dicourage shoppers with their behavior.  I disagree that quiet,
well-dressed, unobtrusive pamphleteers are in this cathegory any more
than people handing-out restaurant ads.

It's not ""censoring opinions""--you can express those opinions elsewhere.
In the USSR, this is not possible.

First, people who don't like the leafletting are not likely to complain
about it.  (Who are they going to complain to?  And about what?)
And the owners of the mall have made the judgement that in general, shoppers
will not go to the mall as much if the leaflets are given out.  If the
owners are mistaken about this, their mistake will result in loss of money
by them, and eventually they will have to change their policy.
Yes, I am saying to trust the owners in their judgement of shopkeepers'
preferences--after all, if they're wrong, they'll feel it in their pocketbook.

It's quite possible customers might dislike advertising leaflets less than
they do political pamphlets.  As I have pointed out before, customers
may do things for illogical reasons, and this is not even that illogical,
since the customer preference is based upon the type of content of the
leaflets-- advertising vs. politics.

Not actually.  I _was_ hoping that you would say that you do not think that
the Communists should take over the world except for the US.  The reason I
exclude the US is that very few people in the US are willing to
say that they think the US should have a Marxist-Leninist form of government.
There is a group of people who seem to think that Communisim is fine for
the rest of the world. Try saying it Tim.  That's right, 
don't discuss McCarthyism (just exactly what is that, anyway?), just say
that you DON'T WANT THE COMMUNISTS TO WIN.  Try to keep criticisms of the 
US out of the paragraph in which you (hopefully) do this.  Once this is done
we can discuss what reasonable steps can be taken to prevent our little
red friends from 'building socialism"" all over the place.  Incidentally, 
my posting compared the possible penalties for trespassing to the penalties
for 'slandering the Soviet state'.  Of course, _criticising_ the US will not
get you put in jail at all, not even for ""short legally defined term"".
My understanding of the 'blacklisting' issue is that people were denied
employment on political grounds.  This is not the same as a prison term.
Also, can you think of any period of 'left-wing hysteria', or is it only 
right-wingers who are subject to this form of mental disturbance?

Unless you propose using tax money to pay for the support and maintenance
of the mall (rather than charging the stores rent), the stores and
the mall management (acting on behalf of the owner) are the only ones
who have a legitimate ""right"" to determine what can and cannot be done
in the mall.  In fact, when malls became a gathering place for teen-age
gangs, the police were called in to eject them, even though they were
not patronizing the store.
If Tim really wants to distribute leaflets on the mall, he can approach
a few of the merchants, show them what he wants to distribute, and
ask the merchant to bring it up at the next ""tenants meeting"".
Charities and non-profit organizations frequently do this, and are
given permission to leaflet for a specific period of time.  For example:
Easter Seals can have various fund raising events during the week or two
preceding the telethon.  Ecology groups and the forest service people are
invited during RV exibition week.
The main concern of mall management is control of any activity which
might be percieved by the tenants as driving customers away.  If
you can convince the tenants that your activities will ATTRACT
people to the mall, you might be able to get the whole mall for
a 'Theme exibit'.  Also, find out what the themes will be, and
who is running them.  You may be able to get a booth and distribute
leaflets from there.  From the original posting, it sounds like
you were ejected because you didn't go through channels.","DiIu60B-cU0J",18,1986-03-13,12,0

More likely, a church would allow someone to stay if either they participated
or they merely observed, i.e., they didn't disturb the service in any way.
Similarly, mall owners may allow people into the mall on the condition that
they don't disturb any of the (other) shoppers there.

A critical distinction, which you failed to mention, is that we are talking
about two different types of power, economic and political.  Economic power
is maintained in a free society by continuously pleasing consumers, while
political power is maintained in a non-free society by frightening the populace
into submission through violence and the threat thereof.  It is thus difficult
to imagine that our economic freedoms could lead to abuse of human rights,
while it seems that the abuse of human rights is necessary for the
maintenance of power by the communist party in the Soviet Union, at least
in the long term.

I fully agree that there are differences between types of property.
It is not much questioned that if you run a bissness on a property,
than you cannot limit access to it in an arbitrary way.  For example,
it is not legal to refuse leasing an appartment solely because the
applicant is black.  Access to a store cannot be limited in this fashion
as well.  
What is being proposed here is censorship by mall management (whatever the
form of this management is).  If driving customers away is a legitimate
concern, then simple rule concerning the behavior of leaflet distributors
would suffice.  I already ask why airports or downtown shopping alleys
can put up with them.  
Imagine that Tim is not a peacenik but a Trotskyist who wants to 
distribute his leaflets.  Do you think that many merchants would 
find it a cute idea to let him do it in the week around anniversary
of Trotsky's death?  Scary for shoppers?  Indeed, but why shoppers
in Cambridge Central Square do not avoid the stores?  If anything
makes peoples to go to a mall instead, it is prices, selection
and availability of parking.
The ancient democracies had to have the meeting places for the people,
be it Greek agora or Roman forum.  It seems that suburban communities
suffer a kind of agorafobia: a fear against a place where the most
of the public can meet freely.  Res publica, common wealth, turns into
a constellation of carefully insulated communities.  In this circumstances
I agree more with the decision of NJ courts, which view malls as
equivalent to public places than NY courts, which do not.

stated that there is always freedom of speech, regardless of 
access to public places like Malls, by using the electronic media.
If nothing else, according to the free market, one should simply
be able to *BUY* time on TV to present one's opinions.
Mobil Oil does it, Polluting Companies do it to prove they are
not polluting, so surely citizens concerned about population
control, preventing war and other issues should *at least*
be able to *BUY* time on TV to present their opinions.
 
Alas, this is *not* the case. Moreover the way in which requests
for *paid* time are turned down graphically illustrates media bias.
A report in the March 9, 1986 New York Times reveals this bias
quite clearly (p.56):
(quoted w.o. permission)
  ""The National Conservative Political Action Committee says it
   will spend $1.5 million on a campaign to sell Americans on aid
   to the rebels (sic) in Nicaragua.  The advertisements advance
   a kind of Central American domino theory with a 30-second spot
   depicting Mexican Communist terrorists(my note: the ""rebels""
   are of course, *not* ""terrorists"") sneaking across the border,
   each with the goal of murdering 10 Americans. (My note:
   plausible scenario eh?!!) Another conservative group, the
   National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, says it
   will spend $2 million on its ads, which assail the Sandinista
   Government of Nicaragua and suggest links to Libyan terrorists.
 
  ""Meanwhile, Neighbor to Neighbor, a San Francisco-based group,
   says it is having great difficulty buying air time for 
   ""Faces of War"", a 30-minute program that portrays conditions in
   Nicaragua and El Salvador and takes a strong stand against
   American support for the Nicaragua rebels (my note, once
   again we note that the NY Times has decided that the Contras
   are ""rebels"" while it is somehow obvious that ""Mexican Communists""
   depicted in right-wing ads are ""terrorists""-double think in action!)
  ""Nick Allen, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor, said more than
   100 television stations around the country had refused to sell
   air time to broadcast the program, whose host is Mike Farrell, the
   ""B.J."" of the old M*A*S*H television series.  Many stations,
   Mr. Allen said, called it too controversial or ""unbalanced""
  ""In Washington, four stations refused the program, he said, but a
   fifth, WTTG, Channel 5,is among about 30 around the country that
   accepted it and will show the program at 11:30 tonight.""
 
I find this sort of censorship and blatant bias contradicts claims
that (a)there is a ""liberal"" bias in the media (quite the opposite
is *indeed* the case)  (b) one can always *BUY* time to present
one's opinions.  Certainly a 30-minute program, while more in-depth,
is harder to put on.  But then again the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been among many groups denied
access even to 30-second spots on late-night TV.

   ""Although no one has made a reliable national survey on the matter
    a modest sampling suggests that groups producing programs supporting
    the policies of the Reagan Administration often have little
    difficulty in buying time.  John Fisher, chairman of the American
    Security Council, which makes the largest number of half-hour
    programs with a pro-defense viewpoint, said that the council placed
    ""Peace through Strength"" - a program aimed at alerting Americans
    about the dangers of ""peace through appeasement"" - on 174 stations
    in one week in September, 1984.
   ""According to Mr. Fisher, ""Peace through Strength"" and ""Crisis in the
    Americas"", a pro-Administration program on Central America, have each 
    been shown more than 900 times on television.  In many cases the
    programs were broadcast free by stations as public-service programs
    for which the council did not have to buy time, he said.
 
    .....
   ""Neighbor to Neighbor has filed a complaint with the FCC against KBHK-TV,
    San Francisco's Channel 44, charging a breach of the Fairness Doctrine
    (my note: Reagan's appointees to the FCC all support total elimination
     of the Fairness Doctrine)
    because of the station's refusal to sell time.  Mr Allen says that
    KBHK is usually willing to accept paid broadcasting and that the only
    prime-time coverage that Channel 44 has given to Central America
    in the last 12 months has been the pro-Administration opinions of
    the Rev. Jerry Falwell on his Moral Majority programs.  Mr Falwell

Now why should this be? Presumably the groups affected are willing to
pay enough for the time to compensate the TV station for their lost
revenue, including the effect on neighboring show's viewing share,
otherwise this is hardly a fair criticism. TV stations are generally owned
by corporations, so it's unlikely the owners have personal opinions that
lead to these refusals. If corporate management is acting against the
interests of the shareholders to suppress opinions *they* don't like, they
leave themselves open to lawsuites from infuriated shareholders.
This leaves two possibilities:
    - The TV stations think airing these programs will annoy their
      audiences and thus affect later revenues.
    - The TV stations think they may loose their licences or have
      other regulatory problems as a result of airing the shows.
The first *could* be a factor, but it seems unlikely to be major. Do
viewers of *Dallas* really care about what political opinions have been
aired on the station?
So my guess is that these problems stem from fear of government regulation.
The solution seems obvious, though I doubt Sevener would agree with it.

for him to be removed by displeased consumres.

I can't comment much on this, since I don't know the deatils of Marcos'

power and political power are separate, by definition.  Since
Mracos' Philipines was not a free society, I don't see how the

I believe that such rights are morally justified.  Moreover, this

rights were morally justified, rather than practically justified.
You may well be right about what the important question is, but why
do you assert that I am responsible for steering the conversation

with property rights.

Apparently, you and I differ in a fundamental way over just what a 
right constitutes.
As far as I'm concerned, the right of free speech is the right not to
be prevented from speaking, it is not the right to be supplied with a
microphone aor an auditorium at another's expense.  Nor is it the
right to be heard, i.e., the right to have an audience.

does not just show up in *endorsements* it also shows up quite
graphically in the refusal to even air *paid* ads by groups
opposing militarism.

Now this is a rather curious ""free market"".  I had always thought that
a free market meant that products or services should be offered to
all with the money to pay for them.  This is supposedly the glory of
the truly free market - as a merchant I will sell shoes to *anyone*
be they black or white, fascist, communist or atheist.  Now we find
groups with the money to pay for ads being turned down while other
groups are being provided similar time for free ""in the public interest"".
Does this or does this not illustrate a clear bias?

Hmmm, really? I would like you to document a single case in which a
polluting company was refused paid time for an ad.

I didn't realize that selling any product or service in a free market
was dependent on ""looking favorably upon the message"".  Moreover it
is curious that TV stations had no qualms about placing cigarette
commercials on their stations - was it because they wished to promote
lung cancer rates?  I have seen numerous ads promoting nuclear
energy on different TV stations - do these TV stations have
a magic solution to the problems of nuclear wastes which lasts for
centuries?
Moreover isn't it interesting the *type* of bias this represents in
the supposedly ""liberal"" media?
I patiently await your documentation of a single case in which a
polluting company was refused paid advertising time.

Look around you, then.  Read newspapers and history books.
Just because 'economic' and 'political' have distinct definitions does
not mean 'economic power' and 'political power' are separate.  Mike did
not claim they were identical.
In an intelligent and well-informed society run by an honest government,
the two powers would be completely distinct.  But in our 'free' society,
the electorate is easily influenced by advertising, which costs money,
and members of the government can easily abuse its powers to gain personal

Your definition of ""free speech"" would go over quite well with the
Communist Party of the USSR, the National Socialists of Germany,
P.W. Botha of South Africa, and all other dictators throughout the
world.

I am sure that many people were blacklisted in the 1950's; it is not a made
up story.  I consider that a very unfortunate chapter in our history.  However,
it might be well to keep some perspective on what was going on in those days.
The Soviet Union was colonizing (and in the process murdering a lot of innocent
people) many countries that just wanted to be left alone (can any of us here 
in the U.S. really understand what Poland has gone through in the past 47
years?).  Many people, well meaning I am sure, did identify themselves with the
philosophy if not the government of the Soviet Union in the 1930's and 40's.
Some of them took an awfully long time to wake up to the reality that the 
Soviety Union represented brutality and repression.  
Also, it is bad enough to be blacklisted in a given industry, but another
thing to be blacklisted in a country that has only one employer; namely the
government.  I might also mention that there has been quite a bit of what
I would call McCarthyism on the left in this country.  Do you remember the
Carter cabinet member in 1980 who almost literally called Reagen a racist?
Reagen may lack a lot of good qualities (such as seeing reality), but he
is basically a man of decent motives.  I think branding him a racist is
leftwing McCarthyism.  That is not the only example I could mention, but
I will spare you.
The issue is freedom.  It is bad when one person unjustly represses the
freedom of another.  It is wrong when a government unjustly represses the
freedom (such as freedom to breathe) of its citizens.  But, imperfect as
it is, the United States, even at its worst, stands for values far more
humane and positive than the Soviet Union.  If we cannot agree on that
point, I fear we will not do well in competition with the Soviet Union.","djmq3l7T1FEJ",20,1986-03-27,-14,0

Apparently Radford, you have not studied the numerous cases in which
journalists in the media were summarily dismissed for expressing
views at variance with ""business interests"". TV stations understand
the unfortunate fact that the Military-Industrial Complex has
billions of dollars - Peace groups have scarcely any.  They are
so destitute the recent Great Peace March folded for lack of funds.
(as well, I suspect, due to poor management)
Sydney Schanberg was the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who
was depicted in the movie ""The Killing Fields"" for his reporting
on Cambodia.  He was just dismissed from the New York Times after
publishing a series of articles in opposition to the Times editorial
policies on housing and community issues.
John B Oakes *used* to be the senior editor of the New York Times:
he was a relative of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger the publisher of the
Times.  He was dismissed as editor of the Times after publishing
a series of editorials which infuriated the New York Times'
corporate board.  In exchange, he is allowed to write Op-Ed pieces
on a regular basis.
THIS is what happens at the ""liberal"" bastion of the New York Times.
*HOW* can TV stations suffer regulatory problems from airing paid
ads of Peace groups when they also air ads of pro-militarist
groups for absolutely nothing?
The real problem is that TV stations are frightened to death that their
corporate sponsors may reduce support if they allow an alternative
viewpoint to be placed on the air.  After all, the biggest American
corporations also stand to gain billions from Star Wars and
the nuclear arms buildup.
 
There are a number of books you can read for information on the media
and its corporate sponsors.  ""The Powers That Be"" by David Halberstam
is one that is highly recommended.  Another one is ""The Establishment""
by Leonard Silkwood.  There was also an excellent documentary on
Edward Murrow on HBO recently.  Hopefully, perhaps they will show it
again.
I continue to be amazed at the naivete of some people on this net!

If it is indeed true, as I have read in various articles summarizing
studies done on this question, that
1)well-paid factory jobs are declining  (this is *undoubtedly* true)
2)the major increase in jobs has been in low-paid service jobs
 
Then it only makes sense that 65% of new jobs have gone to women.
As the husband gets laid off from his $20-30k factory job, the
wife is increasingly forced to go out and work at McDonald's
or anywhere she can get a job.  Since she has probably been out of
the labor force for years low-paid service jobs are what she will
probably get. 
 
This would seem another deceptive use of statistics by the right-wing
similar to their attempt to try to make it look as if the country
is going broke aiding the poor by lumping Social Security in with
welfare programs.  Note it says ""65% of all the wage and salary growth
has gone to women"".  The phrasing of this makes it sound as if
women are getting more raises than men.  I don't think that's
what it really measures but rather simply totals all increased
wages and salaries from new jobs combined with any raises.
If this  is true then of course if women are getting most of the new
McDonald's type jobs then they will also get most of the
wage and salary growth.  But *how much*?  If women were getting
new jobs comparable to those of men then they should get *at least*
the same increase in wage and salary growth as their increase in jobs.
They are not: instead women are getting 78% of the new jobs predominately
in low-paid service positions but only 65% of increased pay.
 
If it is indeed true that most of the new jobs are low-skilled and
lowpaid service jobs, and these are taken mostly by women then
this explains why women are not getting the share of increased
total wages one would expect if they were getting new jobs
equivalent to men.

I have already pointed out that in fact this indicates the new jobs
women are getting are *not* as well-paid as men.
But this is really a poor measure overall which tells us almost
nothing.  The questions to be asked in comparing women to men
and whether they are truly achieving equality are:
1)what are the median incomes for men vs. women?
  unfortunately it still remains true that women earn 65% of
  what men earn.  This statistic has not changed to my knowledge
  during the entire Reagan administration.
  (at least it hasn't gotten worse as have the poverty rate,
   unemployment rate, income inequality, trade deficits,
   savings rate,etc ad nauseum..............................)
2)out of the new jobs created how many well-paid professional
  jobs were filled by women?  Has women's representation in
  professional jobs like medicine, law, engineering, science,
  etc. appreciably increased?  I believe they have increased
  slightly, regardless of Reagan's attacks on affirmative action.
 
The statistics cited by National Review are both deceptive
and irrelevant.  But that is hardly surprising for National Review.
Nor for the Detroit News and the media in general.

Glad to; I thought it was obvious. My apologies. *Business deregu-
lation may be better for equal opportunity than affirmative action*.
Of course there are other factors involved than govt  policy,  so
the  conclusion  is merely an inductive conjecture. That is why I
added the (?).  But if you wished to accuse me of a logical  fal-
lacy, it should've been ""post hoc, ergo propter hoc"", rather than
""non-sequitur"".
Instead, you interpreted my note as a blanket endorsement of  the
present  administration.  To dispel that impression (and I really
should not have to) let me list a few areas where I disapprove of
its  policies:  MX  ; abortion; death penalty; school prayer; re-
vival of detente; choice of welfare cuts; incoherent  mixture  of
monetarism and supply-side'ism; indiscriminate DoD funding; empty
rhetoric on terrorism. I could name many, many more.
Now please re-read your response calmly - and I know you can be
logical when you try. What do GI casualties have to do with
the text *or* the title of my note ? Watch that knee, Mike:
it jerked in mid-word! Right between Reagan- and -omics.

You are joking, of course, but there *are* a lot of people who
think that someone who gets a job (a woman, immigrant or whatever)
*takes* the job from others. On the contrary, anyone who holds
a productive job *makes* jobs for others. Thus, the more jobs

Fortunately, others have adequately rebutted the original ""conclusion"", and
their rebuttals serve equally well for this one.  Though of course you still
provide no reasoning.

Sorry, but your argument wasn't even complete enough to be of the fallacious
form ""correlation implies cause"".  Because you didn't establish that your
statistics had anything to do with equality (as other rebuttals have shown.)
Without a base of reference, you might just as well be saying that women
are getting further ahead of men, which certainly wouldn't be equality.
But I don't want to put words in your mouth.  (They'd hardly fit past your

Gosh, I guess it's my turn now to dispell your impression that I dislike
everything the present administration does.  I can list a few things too:
Supreme Court Justice O'Conner, (it's getting harder to think of anything
else...) firing Burford and Watt, keeping Bush silent, embarrasing itself, etc.

I understand how creating new jobs leads to creating other new jobs,
but just how does forcing one person out of a job due to availability
of cheaper labor create new jobs?  The current policy seems to be to
create conditions of extreme poverty and then lower the minimum wage for
minors.  The economic conditions force the minors to seek work instead
of attend school; the differential on wages gives them a competitive
advantage for *existing* jobs, lowering the cost to the employer and forcing
the higher-paid adult out of work.  Since labor is inelastic (something
conveniently ignored by free market freaks), the adult ends up unemployed,
his children drop out of school to go to work ...
Now in the case of immigrants, many of the jobs they take are so bad
no one else would take them anyway.

Obvious that it was your conclusion, perhaps.  An obvious conclusion from
the quote, hardly.  I love this ""may be"".  It is a true statement.
So would ""may not be"".  In books like ""Chariot of the Gods"" or
""Devil's Triangle"" you find lots of lines like ""Perhaps we have been
visited by aliens with powerful technologies."" or ""Is it possible
that there is a force here beyond the current understanding of science?"".
I forget the name of this little rhetorical technique, but the intent
is to mislead by insinuation.  Dangerous little minds will take your
your empty statement as a *conclusion*.  You are waging a disinformation
campaign.
>Of course there are other factors involved than govt  policy,  so

Inductive conjecture?  Have you ever heard the term ""intellectual honesty""?
Don't you think your inductive process would be a bit more valid if it took
into account, just for instance, the increase in the percentage of jobs that
are in the service sector and the percentage of such jobs that are held by
women?
>That is why I added the (?).
Like in the ""Is it possible ...?"" case that is ignored by small minds

post notes with conscious rhetorical fallacies?

You *must* be kidding.  You post something that occurred during the
Reagan administration, with a ""conjectured"" but totally unjustified
(by you or the quote) implication that a specific policy not only
was responsible, but was better than another policy which wasn't
even treated by the data (affirmative action is still in effect
despite Meese's attempts to dismantle it, and you offered no data
indicating the change in the number of women in the workplace since a.a.
went into effect).  So Mike responds with a couple of his own
(dead servicemen and DoD waste), also unsupported and arguably p.h.e.p.h.
You don't see a valid connection?  You want put your *method* of
presentation of information out of bounds of discussion?  No
dice.  You said elsewhere that you agree with the principle that
your conclusion, even if correct, is not trustworthy if it wasn't
reached through impartial analysis.  So put it into practice.
Intellectual honesty.  Think about it.

I always have trouble with statements like the above concerning 
how much women make compared to men. It seems to me that the 65% 
figure quoted cannot be representative of the *current* situation.
A far more useful number, in my opinion, would be the earnings ratio
of women to men for those people who have entered the workforce in the
last five or so years. This would provide a much better ""snapshot"" of
what is going on then a number that includes women who grew up in an
era when females were not only expected to perform only menial type
work but were also often barred from various (high paying) professions.
So how about it? Does anyone have said figure, or something close? 
I've never seen anything other than the all inclusive and somewhat
misleading 65% number. The only reason I can think of for this  is
that this ratio would be higher (perhaps significantly so) than 65%
and thus would not make as good a rallying point. 
[I imagine that the next thing I'll be reading is that the solution
for this problem is anti-market place comparable worth legislation.]

Glad to; I thought it was obvious. My apologies. *Business deregu-

Of course there are other factors involved than govt  policy,  so
the  conclusion  is merely an inductive conjecture. That is why I
added the (?).  But if you wished to accuse me of a logical  fal-
lacy, it should've been ""post hoc, ergo propter hoc"", rather than

I addressed them to the large minds, to give them something  that

enough to *change their mind* once in a while. Better still,

The newspapers write that the administration  has  been  dragging

tration claims to be scrapping regulations by the bushel,  and  I
believe  (perhaps erroneously) there is some core of truth in it.

*prevented*  the  gains  in equality. I think this is interesting
and worth consideration. I offer the facts *for* consideration.

I think you've got hold of the wrong end of the stick, here.  You might
ask of the first part of a surgical procedure: ""How does cutting
people open cure them?""
The ""availability of cheaper labor"" means that there are people willing
to do the work for less.  Typically it means that the ""cheaper labor""
folks are POORER than the fellow who has the job already.  
So you offer the person who has the job a lower wage -- he refuses,
he ""needs"" the salary he had.  (This process can be VERY indirect --
the folks in Michigan, with a per-capita income of $11,466,
can lose fleet contracts to the folks in Japan with a per-capita
income of $9,864).
You then offer it to the ""cheaper labor"", who accepts (You offer it
first to the people you've been dealing with because that's smart
business).  The ""cheaper  labor"" is not some subhumanoid hive-oriented
creature who may be safely regarded as more compliant, or less
deserving -- he (or she) is a human being, perhaps living in a poorer
country, perhaps the victim of prejudice, perhaps simply less-skilled
(though sufficiently skilled that he/she is useful to you).
Is it so horrible that the free market in this case tends to distribute
money among the downtrodden and away from those who refuse to compete?
>The current policy seems to be to
>create conditions of extreme poverty and then lower the minimum wage for
>minors.  
That's quite a remarkable statement.  Where can I find the
organization doing this?  Lowering or getting rid of the minimum wage
WOULD be a good idea -- before the imposition of the minimum wage,
black youth unemployment was about the same as white youth
unemployment.  I assume that whoever is administering this ""policy"" is
not couching it in terms of ""creating conditions of extreme poverty""
-- what do they (whoever ""they"" are) actually say about it?
>The economic conditions force the minors to seek work instead
>of attend school; the differential on wages gives them a competitive
>advantage for *existing* jobs, lowering the cost to the employer and forcing
>the higher-paid adult out of work.  
Quite a simplistic analysis, this.  I assume that this is backed up
with some statistics, somewhere?  In particular it seems to imply that
the role of skill and experience can be neglected.  In some jobs this
is true -- some assembly-line work, for example.  In other jobs (heavy
equipment operation, carpentry) this is not true.
>Since labor is inelastic (something
>conveniently ignored by free market freaks), the adult ends up unemployed,
>his children drop out of school to go to work ...
Once you're an ""official adult"", then it's nasty of Jim@ism780 to tell
you that you can't have a job because Jim wants to keep employed
somebody making (say) twice your anticipated wage, and until you're
that age, you're pretty heavily under the thumb of your parents, at
least as far as getting a real job goes.
Labor inelastic (in supply)?  Somewhat, certainly, but do you have any
figures?  If labor WERE very inelastic in supply, then we would NOT see a
change in high-school students' behavior because of a change in wages.
Further, the person in the high bracket (whose job is about to be
destroyed unless he takes a pay cut) would then not even consider
refusing the lower salary -- it would be madness.
Or perhaps you mean ""inelastic in demand""?  This would imply that
jobs are NOT created in response to offers to take jobs for lower
wages, nor destroyed in the face of demands for higher wages.  But
this propensity for detroying jobs in the face of demands for
continued high wages would seem to be what you're complaining about,
so I doubt you mean ""inelastic in demand"".
Besides, it would imply that no jobs were destroyed by the imposition
of minimum wage.  How many elevator operators, shop girls,
lamplighters, butlers, and maids, do you see around these days?
>Now in the case of immigrants, many of the jobs they take are so bad
>no one else would take them anyway.
Besides being more than a little insulting to the immigrants involved,
this contradicts your earlier assertion that labor is ""not elastic"".  
because clearly if a job that ""nobody else would take"" will be taken
anyhow, then the supply of labor is elastic so long as people can
immigrate.","ChtyftyklqUJ",13,1985-11-25,-28,19

You are rewriting history. Just look at the quote above. I gave you FACT,
no conclusion. Food for thought. As a public service. You ASKED for my   
conclusion. I gave it to you: the ""original"" and only.
(On the rebuttals, see below).

>Without a base of reference, you might just as well be saying that women

Right you are: *if* women were *ahead*  of  men,  the  statistics
would  show  they are getting *further* ahead, and it wouldn't be
equality. Facts being what they are, statistics  show  what  they
do. Base of reference is all around you.
Now, for the rebuttals. I assume you mean two notes by Tim Sevener's, as
the others I read consist of silly ad hominem flames. They con-
tain some nice analysis. However,  it does not rebut. Con-
sider Tim's typical case: a man lost a 20K job at a plant, a wom-
an has to take a 10K job at McDonald's.  Certainly  *bad*  -  but
even  then,  there  would  be *leveling* of the sexes - it would
just be leveling *down*. 
Whether the case is really typical for today's economy,  is  much
under discussion on the net. But it is a different question.
The best feature of Tim's analysis is that he has posed some relevant
*questions* . Some conceivable answers to them *would* refute the 
above conclusion; others would *confirm* it. In either case, facts,
not flames, and logic, not ideology, are required.

You said it was an obvious reasoned conclusion.  You didn't give
""may not be"" the same status.  How about providing some analysis
that shows how the data supports the conclusion?  My whole point
is that you are ""leading the witness"" by suggesting plausible
explanations without supporting them, just as Von Daniken does,
which is why I mentioned ""Chariots of the Gods"".

Pardon me, but I have an informed opinion about your intent.
Now, since I have been talking about your mode of presentation,
not about the facts presented, where does your guess come from?
I have no fear of the fact.  I have no fear of conclusions reached from
it through logic.  But I despise dishonest rhetoric.  I will take no
legal action to stop same, nor will I encourage the filtering out
of your comments, nor anything else that constitutes censorship,
which I oppose.  But I will continue to call a spade a spade.
Others can draw their own opinions.

Getting pretty hostile, eh?  Can't take a little criticism, eh?
I suspect we both do a bit of enlightening as well as obfuscating
and controlling.  In my life I have been known more for the former
than the latter. I do wish you luck, in learning to challenge
your own preconceptions as well as all other aspects of quality
of life that people deserve.  I share your wish that I do not
succeed in any sort of suppression.  If you think that strong
expressions of disagreement are suppression, then you don't know
what the word means.  As for control, I wish to exert some
control over my own life and fate, but I have steadfastly avoided
the means of control over others.  Again, I'm not sure you know
what the word means.  As for direction, we can all use some.

Oh, boy, it's not often that I get to thump this fallacy of argument.
#5 ""Evasion of a sound refutation of an argument by the use of a sophistical
formula"" [also known as bumper-sticker thinking.]  (Page 173 of ""How to Think
straight"" by Robert Thouless, in the chapter ""Thirty Four Dishonest Tricks of
Argument"".)
Are you trying to tell us that your methods of analysis, article writing,
or opinion formation are science?  Or are you trying to tell us that
appending a question mark to what you write makes it science?  Hey look,
I just wrote two scientific sentences!  Wait till I tell my mom!

My idea of large minds includes avoiding statements and attributions of

GOD FORBID (er... just between us atheists).
But if science does that, we may do well to emulate her.
Posing a question for discussion may produce better (or at  least
different) results than simply giving your answer for others to 
refute or agree. A couple of good substantive points have already
been made on both sides with respect to my (?) title. (BTW: does the
preceding imply - *because* I ended it with with (?) ? Who cares?)
I didn't stick in that ""science"" quote to prove anything,  but
simply  because  I  like  it, as a kind of epigraph. The quote is
probably inexact. It's from Karl Popper, but I couldn't place it.

Guilty as charged. Flames breed flames;  attributions  of  intent
are among the worst kind. Inquiries about individuals' ""intellec-
tual honesty"" are of the same kind. A *meta-subject* - about what

This denies all institutional aspects of market dynamics.  I suggest you read
some Thorstein Veblen.  I am not going to go into a lengthy debate here about
the realities of free markets; I would just like to point out that economists
much better educated in the intricacies than either you or I have argued
against this view.  After Veblen and Joan Robinson Classicism was
widely considered refuted; it is now back in vogue, more, I would argue, for
political reasons than those of theory.

This was hypothetical; it was rather shoddy of me not to make that clear.
And I was speaking of the move toward service sector jobs and the widespread
trend for formerly skilled jobs to become clerical due to the lower skill
required due to automation.

In areas where there is great labor competition there is little competition
among employers in regard to salary.  Without minumum wage or
union-established wages (which are not ""artificial"" laws affecting a
""natural"" market since all market behavior is subject to human laws,
especially the laws of property), if a service sector employer lowers wages
the employee cannot simply shop around for a higher wage.  When the supply of
labor is high relative to the demand, wages drop.  But one cannot simply
switch to a higher-paying field.  The way our society is structured, we have
ignorant or unskilled people without that flexibility.  We can let them reach
poverty levels when the evolution of the markets select against them, but
there is a high societal cost.  It means increased crime, disease, and
suffering; the former two clearly hurt all of us (even libertarians :-).
And if the working force dies off due to ""natural selection"" and then the
environmental factors change again their unavailibility could adversely
affect the rest of us.

I would argue (without figures, sorry; but I don't notice too many economic
arguments made with figures) that labor is VERY inelastic *in some ways*.
You have only shown that it is not *totally* inelastic.  The inelasticity
comes from restricted skill or other requirements limiting the jobs a person
is able to take, the costs associated with changing jobs due to search time,
overhead, and especially need to relocate, and the limited understanding that
flexibility is possible (meta-skill, if you wish; again, we can allow such
people to suffer the consequences, but it still is an inelasticity).

It isn't what I am talking about, but again you indulge in a logical fallacy.
The correct implication would be that jobs are NOT *ALWAYS* created ....
There is a *range* of inelasticity.
>Besides, it would imply that no jobs were destroyed by the imposition
>of minimum wage.  How many elevator operators, shop girls,
>lamplighters, butlers, and maids, do you see around these days?
Again, it would not imply any such thing, since the term is not absolute.
But I am interested in your demonstration that the loss of those jobs was
due to the imposition of minimum wage, either in whole or in part.

>Besides being more than a little insulting to the immigrants involved,

I was talking specifically about immigrants from below the Rio Grande.
I'm not sure it is insulting if it reflects their desperation, the inability
of illegals to take arbitrary jobs, and the dismal conditions that they have
taken for granted all their lives.  People's expectations are not to be
discounted.  Here in California, the blue collar workers often blame the
immigrants for taking their jobs, and the ""you wouldn't take ours"" argument
is often proffered by the immigrants themselves.
And again you are treating elasticity as a two-state phenomenon.
I should have said ""labor is not perfectly elastic"" instead of ""labor is
inelastic""; sorry.  Of course immigration is a form of elasticity, but people
whose spines are not already bent from stooping in the fields and who do not
know how to live 12 in a room on beans and tortillas and who cannot go back
to Mexico at the end of the harvest season incur a very high cost in taking
such jobs, reflecting inelasticity.  One of the consequences of the current
economic structure is that employers do not provide toilets for farmworkers,
and then complain that farmworkers are ""unsanitary"".  I'm not sure how
a totally unregulated marketplace would alleviate that.
The basis for economic structure is politics; regardless of what is
""natural"", people will attempt to change the environment in the ways that
appear to satisfy their desires, and that will necessarily lead to group
action.  This is why anarchy, libertarianism, and free markets can at best be
temporary phenomena.  We started out as anarchists, and then we evolved.  An
anarchic society is like the primeval soup: elements group forming cells and
then larger organisms with increasing ability to respond in varied ways to
their environment.  When you develop organisms with enough control over their
environments and enough awareness of how to achieve their ends and when the
desired ends go beyond mere survival, you get concentration of power and
feudalism.  Since power cannot be totally centralized, you get subgroups
which eventually become strong enough to challenge the central authority.
Eventually you get a fairly stable fluctuation between centralization and
localization of power.  The whole process gets warped by counter-selfish
behavior like loyalty, nationality, and the like.  If the central authority
is able to actually control mental behavior (via wires, drugs, propaganda and
conditioning, coercive telepathy (Larry Niven's Thrintun), and the like) then
it can get severely warped in the centralization direction without the
central authority even risking loss of loyalty among armed enforcers.
So you see, you will never have a perfect free market system because there
will always be brain-damaged people like me who do not think it is in their
best interests, and we'll form nasty coops with ugly tariffs and pervert your
lovely pure system.
(For a fictional counterexample, read David R. Bunch's _Moderan_, with
robotized individuals (with ""flesh strips"" which retain their humanity)
living in individual robotized Strongholds.)

I thought you were the one who likes to break taboos?  One of the favorite
taboos I like to broach is discussion of the internal consistency of people's
statements and of the processes that lead to disagreement, which include
differing use of language, fallacy, and conscious or unconscious lying.  It
is my firm belief that a major reason Ronald Reagan has that ""teflon sticker""
is because it is taboo in our media to call someone a liar, even if there is
firm evidence.  Of course, libel laws are not complete protection, which
partially explains the ban.  But I really believe that demanding honesty
increases honesty since even the demander, once making the demand, will be
held up to his own standard.  You may totally disagree with me, but you
should not criticize me too harshly for breaking taboos that I believe it is
preferable to break.  However, I have toned down a bit with the awareness
that this taboo is being strongly defended.  So implicit censorship has once
again taken hold.

Does the statement ""Water tends to run downhill"", ""deny"" the existence of
pumps and siphons?  No.  I do not argue here that classical microeconomics
is ""the truth"", merely that some of its conclusions remain true.  Among
these conclusions (or are they postulates?) is the notion that one will
(where one can) buy cheap and sell dear.  If this is not what they still

But Jim!  I'm only somewhat interested in your statement about minimum

activities.

Oh please!  Let's avoid the question of what is ""natural""!  As a
matter of approximate definition in this context, ""artificial""
involves things imposed from outside the system of economic trade and
physical laws, and ""natural"" involves those conditions reached without
""artificial"" restraint or stimulus.  A natural market reaction to
flooding is one thing (food goes up, insurance stocks go down).  An
artificial stimulus to food prices (people are taxed and the tax money
used to buy food, raising its price) is another.  I absolutely concede
that the imposition of property laws by a government is ""artificial"",
similarly that injunctions against force or fraud are also artificial.
I don't argue that ONLY ""natural"" forces should be allowed to operate,
merely that unnatural ones should be applied with the greatest care.
Your mileage may differ :-) -- what other folks regard as ""natural"" and
unnatural is interesting, but not all that important to the question of 
what to do in a given situation.

I'd be very surprised if the market for unskilled labor was so very
inelastic in supply as that of, say, carpenters.  If you need a
ditch-digger, or a field hand, it takes a few minutes to show someone
what to do.  It doesn't matter whether the person was a farm laborer,
a hobo, or a doctor -- the basics of unskilled labor are very easy to
get across, even if you don't speak the language.  This means that
essentially all the cost of changing jobs in unskilled labor is the
cost of moving around (they aren't called ""migrant farm workers""
because they can't move around, by the way), and the
harder-to-evaluate cost of hearing about and deciding to take an
alternative job.  This is not ""nice"".  This is not ""good"".  This is
not what I would  like, but it DOES mean that there's relatively easy
movement between unskilled jobs, which means in turn that aggregate
demand for unskilled labor must go down before we have the spectacle
of a fieldhand unwilling or unable to take a job as a ditchdigger when
that of a  ditchdigger is the same amount of work and pays more
besides.  If you're worried about computer programmers being unable
to become librarians, then we're talking retraining.  If you're
worried about fieldhands becoming ditchdiggers, we're talking about
moving.  I don't argue this is EASY for farmworkers (I concede  a
certain amount of inelasticity) but I don't see it as the obstacle in
TIME that retraining is.

It is you who made the bald statement ""Since labor is inelastic...."".
and stated that this was ignored by free market types.  I think the
two statments are both false.  Labor is SOMEWHAT inelastic, but there are
things less elastic than labor (the supply of art by Da Vinci, and the
supply of orbital vehicles, to name two very extreme examples, (yes,
I could come up with less extreme examples, but since the discussion is
non-quantitative, I'm avoiding a side argument by not doing so)).

No argument there -- except that you're ignoring compensatory factors
like people who have more than one skill, entry of new people into the
market, and the presence of substitutes for labor. (Labor demand
is more elastic if one can replace a particular sort of laborer with 
a particular sort of machine).  Another point to make is that any 
alternative involving artificial support of an industry hides the advantages
of having different skills from people who might want them.

Quite correct.  My mistake to have taken from your statement that
labor was inelastic the implication that you thought labor was
inelastic.  I should have phrased it a little differently.  Of course,
to the extent labor demand IS inelastic, jobs are NOT created or
destroyed in response to the fluctuating supply of laborers.

I suggest then you take a look at ""Minimum Wage, Maximum Folly"" in 
Walter Williams' ""The State Against Blacks"", in which he talks about another
set of low-paying jobs.  Also, try Milton Friedman's ""Free to Choose""
pages 226-228, and ""The Unheavenly City Revisited"" by Banfield, pp 107-108.
Finally, Benjamin Page, in ""Who Gets What From Government"" has this to say:
	The minimum wage, for example, is supposedly designed to
	ensure a decent wage level for all workers by forbidding any
	wage payments below a certain hourly rate.  But those hoping
	for an egalitarian result fail to take account of how
	employers respond to the minimum wage: they simply refuse to
	hire anyone who cannot produce more than the minimum wage's
	worth of work.  Those who have jobs get paid the minimum, but
	many other jobs are abolished.  Unemployment in certain
	industries (e.g., retail trade) and among those with low skill
	levels (e.g., many black teenagers) rises alarmingly. [pp. 170]

And of course, I never claimed, (nor did any free-market advocate I
know of make the claim) that the labor market (or any market, for that
matter)  is perfectly elastic.  Let's avoid one-sided emotional
overtones here -- inelasticity in supply doesn't always mean bending
your spine and giving up your native land.  It can also be reflected
in going to medical school, or joining a trade union.

Perhaps by making it profitable to do so.  Right now, if you're an
uneducated illegal immigrant, not currently capable of producing a
minimum wage value (hence, you are employed doing piecework or
employed illegally), your job-path upward is more than a little restricted.  If
there were no such thing as an illegal immigrant (because immigration
was free), and no such thing as ""minimum wage"" there'd presumably be
fewer artificial ""chokes"" on  (say) registering for courses, getting a
government job, joining the US Army, registering for various aid
programs, getting jobs as lamplighters, shopgirls, elevator operators,
movie ushers, butlers, maids, cooks, (and, hell, let's throw out
licensure) hairdressers and social workers.
I specifically do NOT hope that this would provide a toilet in whatever
place you saw that lacked one.  Nope -- in a free society, you're free to
be a son-of-a-bitch.  On the other hand, you're also no longer one of the
very few places immigrants from south of the Rio Grande could work -- and
why work for a son-of-a-bitch when they can work for pussycats?  
I can't (and won't try to) argue that a free economy eliminates the wretched:
it merely provides them the widest range of opportunity.  So what to do
about the toilet problem?  Well, we could REQUIRE toilets, but,
as Milton Friedman points out in a 7/27/70 Newsweek column, that isn't
necessarily the way to help the farm workers:
	A recent Wall Street Journal story gives a striking example--
	the effects in Michigan of stricter federal and state
	standards for housing migrant farm workers.  The intent: to
	improve the conditions of a group of low-paid workers.  The
	result: to hurt the workers, the farmers, and consumers.
	""Higher labor costs,"" says the story, ""have prompted many
	growers ... to switch to mechanized havesting in recent years,
	lessening demand for migrant workers.  That trend has been
	intensified in the last two years as government agencies have
	implemented stricter housing regulations for growers
	participating in their migrant-worker placement programs....
	""State and federal officials estimate that mechanization could
	eliminate from 6000 to 10,000 jobs in Michigan this summer
	that were previously done by migrants.... License applications
	[for migrant camps] are down 11 percent so far this summer....
	""Nonetheless, approximately 50,000 migrant workers, mostly
	Mexican-Americans from Southwest Texas, are expected to come
	into Michigan looking for work this summer.  That's about the
	same number as came through last year.""
	Mechanization is a good thing if it is a response to a decline
	in the number of persons seeking jobs as migrant workers at
	low wages.  That would mean that the former migrant workers
	have found better employment opportunities.  Mechanization is
	a bad thing if it is a response to higher labor costs imposed
	arbitrarily from the outside.  That simply wastes capital to
	replace people who are forced into unemployment or even less
	desirable jobs.
	*Migrant workers* are clearly hurt.  It is small comfort to an
	unemployed migrant worker to know that, if he could get a job,
	he would have better housing.  True, the housing formerly
	available may have been most unsatisfactory by our standards.
	However, the migrant workers clearly regarded it, plus the
	accompanying jobs, as the best alternative available to them,
	else why did they flock to Michigan?  It is certainly
	desirable that they have better alternatives available to
	them, but until they do, how are they helped by eliminating
	alternatives, however unsatisfactory, that are now available?
	That is simply biting off their noses to save our faces.

Such as theft?  I don't think that we'll ever be rid of it, but to
argue that BECAUSE we'll never be rid of it, it should be SANCTIONED
*would* be a mistake.  Similarly, to argue that politics is always
with us, and THEREFORE we must have a dynamic, expanding,
allowed-to-meddle government *would* also be a mistake.  
By the way, history abounds with examples of trade without government
(trade between nations) and government without trade (communes, families).
Neither is the ""basis"" for the other -- rather the pursuit of goals
is the basis of both.
To argue that
the basis for economic structure is politics is to argue that the basis
for water structure is the riverbed.  I think the comparison is apt. 
A riverbed may lead a river among alternatives, but it can't lead it uphill,
it can't prevent the river freezing over, and it can't prevent it from
drying out.  Similarly, you may use political means to affect the market,
but not to cause it provide ""free lunches"",  not to suspend the laws
of supply and demand.

Huh?  This doesn't fit in very well with what I've heard of primate 
evolution, or are you going back to non-social creatures altogether?
The stability of a libertarian society is of course a matter of debate.
By some standards, the US is a libertarian society (less so nowadays)
and it has lasted 200 years.  There have, as Murray Rothbard points out, been 
quasi-libertarian societies in the past that have lasted for some time.
Another discussion, another time, I think -- but 
(and here we come to the promised comment) to simply state that 
politics is a useful way of garnering power and therefore no non-political
system will be able to withstand it is to underestimate the tolerance of a 
libertarian society for (say) local governments, and to overestimate the 
power of politics.

Now, Jim!  I suspect you of deliberately baiting me!  Do you recall my asking
for a ""perfect"" free market?  No?  Perhaps you recall my saying (many times)
that ""Utopia is not an option""?  You are, of course, WELCOME to form coops
and live communally in any society where I find myself dictator.  You'd
even be free to have tariffs among people who've agreed to this.  No sweat.
You'll lose by it, of course.  The people in the agreement will have to
pay more than the folks outside it.  Correspondingly, the people inside
the agreement will be able to internalize externalities in ways not open
to non-members (members would be able to correctly handle a free-rider
situation involving only themselves).
I object to none of this, provided that you initiate neither force nor
fraud against those who didn't sign your agreement.

Whoa!  You're arguing that supporting the overthrow of a ""sovereign"" nation
should not be lightly undertaken, and claiming that the alternative, leaving
it unmolested, should require less evidence.  I'm pointing out that 
you MIGHT be doing the sort of thing you dislike in another context.  Were
this a private conversation, I probably wouldn't have brought it up, but since
you're not the only one reading this, it seems worthwhile to bring the
reader's position into it too.  How many readers who vote for taxation
are aware they've taken a stand?

If I misunderstand you, please say so.

I have NOT heard you argue for taxes.  Of course, IF you have voted for them,
you have advocated them (unless you think that one shouldn't vote one's
conscience, or that folks are not impressed by the vote).  Only you know,
so far, whether you have voted for them.

Indeed.  To vote FOR a tax issue involves the consequence that one has
put an iota more power behind the state's power to tax.  Is this the
same as ""advocacy""?  It's certainly highly stylized, but it seems to
me that it is.  If you mean to draw a purely artificial distinction
between what you express on a ballot, and what you express in prose,
that's fine by me, but both are listened to, both are taken to
represent your opinion, and VOTES affect law.
>I asked why you would have me argue against taxation, and you did not answer
>that, unless your claim is that not voting for taxation is the same as
>arguing against it, a strange claim but one you seem to be making.
Oooh!  I hate this!  You said:
	>Why would you want me to argue against taxes when you don't
	>think I have enough information to argue for them?
AND IN DIRECT RESPONSE, I said:
	Because if your point is that if you don't know enough you
	shouldn't support positions, then it seems to me to be only
	consistent to agree that if you don't know enough you
	shouldn't vote for taxation.
To say it again, Jim, if your point about Jan's position about Nicaragua
is that he doesn't have enough information to advocate the overthrow
of a sovereign state, and he therefore shouldn't take such positions,
then it surely also applies to OTHER situations where ANYONE forms an
opinion on what they feel is enough information.  In particular, lots
of folks vote FOR (say) school levies.  To do so enhances the power of
the state to tax, and the polls are widely used as an opinion-indicator.
To vote FOR a school levy is thus to put oneself in the camp of those who
wish to increase taxes (for whatever  reason one thinks sufficient).
It is also a measure of support to those who would take a little more of
one's paycheck to put under government control.  Is this to be done 
WITHOUT STRINGENTLY SUFFICIENT INFORMATION?  Hell no!  And yet folks
do it all the time.  To claim that Jan didn't check carefully enough
before suggesting a view on netnews (which, after all, the state cannot
use as authority for anything) and to accuse him of intellectual dishonesty
because the facts look different to you strike me as a pair of rather
overblown responses.  As an instrument in showing you just HOW overblown,
I've invoked the POSSIBILITY that you've voted for issues  important
to other folks as Nicaragua is to you.  My claim is not that
""not voting for taxation is the same as arguing against it"", but rather that
voting for taxation is an act of the same sort as advocating it.
My GUESS is that you have voted for taxation at some point (most voters
have, I suppose), but the point stands even if you personally have never
done so -- intellectual dishonesty is quite a different thing from 
intellectual completeness.

Ho hum.  If the state were some sort of magical entity, this would be true,
but it's not.  The only worthwhile means I've heard of for judging a state
is by the fate of the individuals in its power.  At least some Nicaraguans
don't like their state.  If people in the US agree with them, perhaps they
should be free to help them.  If they disagree, perhaps they should be
free to donate time to the Sandinista government.  Right now, explicit
foreign aid by individuals is prohibited by the Logan act (probably
by several others too).  My reaction to this sort of controversy is that
the Logan act should be repealed, and people should be free to 
send their money to the Contras, the Sandinistas, or to Joe Bob, based
on the information the individuals consider sufficient.

Well -- in the US a bunch of votes is sufficient to topple one foreign
policy and put in another.  Advocacy on netnews is NOT, no matter how
heated or well-informed.  In short, a vote is a more dire sort of advocacy,
the kind the authorities back up with guns and paycheck withholding than,
advocacy within netnews.

A very good point.  The logic of the argument  holds regardless of the
conduct of the arguer.  My point is that you've over-reacted (impolitely)
to Jan's stuff (of course, I'm not polite, always, myself), and your
rhetoric is made suspect by demanding that his advocacy must pass 
a severer test than yours (he must talk about degradation and death in 
HIS proposal for what to do in re Nicaragua, but you don't have to).

I get it.  Does it count that Jan only suggested ""aid"" to the contras,
which (after all) only turns into explosions ""rather indirectly""?

Given that the Japanese attacked in 1941, and the relocation occurred in
1942, it would have been quite a trick for the Japanese to forsee
relocation (remember, nothing like it had happened in US history).  
>Do you
>really see them as equivalent?  
I see -- the parallel is that the Sandinistas didn't explicitly 
remove all civil rights until recently, so that the suspension of civil
rights cannot be used as a pretext for justifying Contra aid unless
the Japanese-American Internment may be used as a pretext for Pearl Harbor.
That's cute -- I like it.  The problem for you is that IF a revolution
were to happen in the US that endangered and oppressed people, THEN
the Japanese would have had a case for an attack on that government's
authority -- not on Pearl Harbor.  IF that government then were to
declare martial law, then those who argued that ""The US still has a
pretty free government"" would have been dealt a mild blow. (Mild only
because the counter-argument that they only did it because they ""had
no choice"" can be raised).

So?  I argue that the nature of ANY government, particularly one that
claims tight control of its citizens is violence.  My point is that
if he should, you should.  Not that neither of you should.

How about: ""Nobody contends the Sandinistas have clean hands.  Though

Degradation and death didn't come into this except as implicitly understood
by everyone as being in the cards for both sides, until YOU mentioned it
as something Jan SHOULD have mentioned.  He didn't, but you HADN'T, and
it's just nasty of you to insist that a government in power is somehow
more sacred than a revolutionary movement (or did you prefer 
pre-revolutionary Nicaragua to post-revolutionary?)

Perhaps you should have just avoided suggesting that

And it's NOT a good question (if you leave out the implication that
anybody has said they want to destroy the Nicaraguan people), but the
question of whether we have the ""right"" to do nothing while people are
being killed is worth asking, too.  BOTH sides involve ""degradation
and death"".  That one involves less than the other is hard to prove,
and there's enough gore to go around without the debating trick of
insisting that the fellow advocating one move in a complex and bloody
situation is required to mention that HE's talking about degradation
and death.

Look:  Find me a Contra who believes that the contras, and only the contras,
are responsible for the armed struggle going on there.  Find me one who
believes that his people would be alive and free under the Sandinistas.
If you have trouble finding such a person (and I propose the ""search""
as a thought-experiment) perhaps it is because THEY believe that things
are better in the most important ways if THEY win.  It's not certain to
me, but I suspect a fair portion of those guys think they'll do better
if they have Yankee aid.

WHOA!  Just let's hear the answer to the question.  Jan is indeed proposing
to send aid to the Contras, and whatever his reason, if the Sandinistas
kill and degrade (notice how ""blowing things up"" has crept in) people,
then COUNTERING them (even if it means other instances of killing and
degrading MAY have as firm a basis in terms of 
minimizing death and degradation as NOT countering them.  Certainly in
ARGUMENT one may not simply insist that this is not true -- one may therefore
not require that the ""other side"" be held to closer rules of conduct
than the ""good side"".
>Jan *does* support the Contras.  The whole *point* of the Contras
>is to kill and blow things up.  You cannot support the Contras
>without supporting killing and blowing things up.  
Oh sure..... I can just hear the Contra's wife: ""Well dear, another nice
day of killing and blowing things up?""  ""Yes Honey, today will be a 
quota-buster for sure.  Think I'll kill our cat first"".  I know of no
movement, anywhere, whose members thought of themselves as having as
an end value the destruction of lives and property.  To accuse the 
Contras of this (without providing facts) is to do what you yourself
have asked that Jan not do -- take a position without revealing 
the factual basis.  As you say, this wouldn't excuse Jan from doing it,
but your own position is weakened if you seem to be requiring Jan's
side to meet specs that your side does not meet.  Let's be clear here:
the issue is whether to fund the Contras.  For the moment, let's simplify
the situation by saying that Jan says ""yes"" and you say ""no"".  If you
simply place, as a bald statement, that the whole point of the 
Contras is to blow things up, (after stating in great detail the importance
of supporting a position factually) then you'd better be able to 
back it up -- and the notion that ""The whole point of the contras is to
kill and blow things up"" strikes me as off in left field.  You may not
agree with the Contras, but it would be like saying the whole point
of the Highway system is to have accidents, or that the whole point of the
legislature is to enslave people.
>You *can*
>support non-intervention without supporting killing and blowing things up,

>politicians in the U.S. and elsewhere.
>So, why do you ask the questin you do, unless it is from a Manichean view?
Let me ease your bafflement.  As I understand it, ""Manichaean"" refers to 
a tendency to divide the world up into starkly evil and starkly good 
parts.  For example, if I were to tell you that blowing things up and
killing was ALWAYS evil, and therefore supporters of it were EVIL,
and that standing neutral or refusing to blow things up was ALWAYS
better, then I'd be taking a Manichaean stance.  As it happens, I'm saying
that even remaining neutral has both good and bad sides, that it's possible
to kill and blow things up in a good cause (though I'm not here saying
that the Contras are, merely that the action, while repugnant, may have
overridingly good consequences).  Similarly, the refraining from action
involved in neutrality is NOT always or purely good, and I've pointed
this out.  
If you say: ""Jan should mention that the policies he's supporting result
in real degradation and death"", but then argue that restraint is a better
policy, you'd better be prepared to argue that restraint results in less
degradation and death.  In particular, you'd better be prepared to show
that restraint does NOT result in degradation and death unless you are also
willing to talk about such degradation and death as a 
result of restraint.  As a widely-read person
who makes a big point about how necessary it is to be well informed before
advocacy, I asked you to tell us either that there is NO such degradation
and death (in which case you would indeed be excused from the sauce for
the goose.... argument) or to concede that the Sandinistas have indeed
indulged themselves, in which case LEAVING them in place involves
(judging from the past) degradation and death, in which case an advocate
of THAT policy (leaving the Sandinistas unmolested) must ALSO mention
degradation and death -- he's advocating letting it continue.

Nobody argues that -- hardly.  Sauce for the goose though -- the 
Sandinistas have dirty hands too.  Let's not demand that their
opponents be the only ones who must admit to advocating violence.
It doesn't MATTER that you aren't arguing that the Sandinistas should
be supported.  It doesn't MATTER that I think you're correct about the
stance our country should take (""stay out"").  What matters is that you're
asking Jan to argue as if he were evil, or advocating evil, when it's
unknown to any of us what the best move is.","-x9hG4s9j-cJ",0,1985-12-08,-20,0

Actually, I doubt the insurance companies would go for this.  It only solves
half of the issue (if it even does that).  Suppose, that I (with my seatbelt
discount) go out driving with me belt on and run into (my fault) someone else
who is not wearing their seatbelt.  My policy is still obliged to pay.

So social darwinism rears its ugly head on the net.  I was just reading
something like this earlier today.  Let me see...  here it is:
    Social Darwinists, following the English social theorist Herbert
    Spencer, thought all such regulation unwise.  ""Very many of the
    poorer classes are injured by druggists' prescriptions and quack
    medicines, Spencer willingly conceded.  But there was nothing wrong
    in that; it was the penalty nature attached to ignorance.  If the
    poor died of their own foolishness, the species would improve.""
		   -- Paul Starr, ""The Social Transformation of
		      American Medicine,"" quoted in the Texas Observer
Funny.  I thought that the cruder examples of this sort of thinking had died
out some time ago.  Obviously they haven't (unless our friend was merely
being facetious).
I've got an even better idea -- why not actively discourage the use of
seatbelts with a heavy tax?  If the social darwinists are right, that should
increase not only the world's average intelligence but its average wealth as
well!  :-{

No offense intended, but this is just the kind of thing that makes lawyers
have unassisted orgasms, makes judges commit suicide, makes insurance
company execs give smug little I'll-get-that-extra-Mercedes-this-year-
after-all smiles, and makes your average Joe's wallet look like an
Ethiopian famine victim.
Who is to decide that an accident could have been prevented by wearing a
seatbelt?  If the insurance company doesn't want to pay the injured all
they have to do is start too long, too expensive court battle to wear
the injured, the courts, and the rest of us down.  This area is far too
subjective and nebulous to be put into an arena where it can cause so
much grief.
My solution to seatbelt, helmet, anti-suicide, and other such 'preventative'
laws is simple:  get rid of them.  You're going to tell me that I can't
take a risk that endangers no one but me?  You're going to tell me that
I can't kill myself if I want to?  Rubbish!
By the way, the You in ""You're going to tell me...."" above is not
directed at Peter, just at legislators in general.
They let people hang-glide and water-ski without helmets, don't they?

When Texas was considering its recently enacted seat-belt law, this very
thing was proposed as an alternative.  It got shot down primarily by
practical considerations--If a non-seat belt user was in an accident, it
was pointed out, all they had to do (assuming they were conscious),
was to quickly buckle up their belts before the dust settled.
Obviously this argument has a few holes, but nobody ever lost money
betting on the lack of intellectual quality of Texas legislators..(-: :-)

While the risks may endanger no-one but you (perhaps), its not true that
they harm no-one but you.  When you are injured, your insurance pays you,
and I pay your insurance company.  You sit in hospital and use the last
bed, so the hospital has to build a new wing, and I pay for it.  You
croak, and use the last cheap plot in the cemetery, so now I have to
buy a more expensive one.  After all this, your ""freedom"" has still
not stopped costing me ...  Now your ex-employer has to employ someone
else, and train them, I pay more for his product.
So, please, if you want to kill yourself, do it in some way that
everyone knows that's what you are doing, and make sure that you
succeed, no insurance, no hospital.  That still doesn't recover
all the costs, but it at least will save some of them.  Remember
that society has an investment in you - you owe us!

   an auto fatality (the cost to the police and hospitals to
   clean up the mess, the cost to the government of not collecting
   in taxes the cost of educating the individual, etc. etc.).
   The average fatality cost about $50,000.  This is paid for

2. a study of every fatality in a specific model year of Volvos
   in Sweden (I think the year was 1975).  The study was done
   jointly by Volvo, the insurance companies, The National
   Traffic Safety Board, and the people who usually reconstruct

   nobody could figure out why the car caught fire; Volvo moved

As a result of this study, Sweden passed a mandatory seat belt
law.
In addition to protecting you in a crash, a good seat belt will
support you if you have to swerve your car to avoid an accident,
thus preventing accidents as well.

An interesting viewpoint, and I can see your point somewhat, but:
a) You live in New York City (I know you don't, but pretend); there is
   a higher crime rate there, and when you get mugged your insurance
   company pays and I pay your insurance company.  I could give a lot
   more examples, but the basic line is that life (and ESPECIALLY
   insurance) ain't fair.  If you're interested in such things,
   definitely take the time to read _The_Invisible_Bankers_ by
   Andrew Tobias.
b) You hang glide and fly small planes, so you get injured and/or
   killed.  I pay.  Life is a bitch, ain't it?
My basic message here is much more objective than that:  There are
insurance discounts for non-smokers for the reasons that you put
forth above, and I like that because I am a non-smoker.  Am I really
a non-smoker?  Send me to your insurance company's doctor and I
guarantee you he can answer that question reliably unless I work
in a coal mine or in downtown L.A.  Now, do I really wear my
seatbelt all the time?  Who knows but me?

I owe you?  OK, I guess you're right -- I'll do my good deed by
reducing the population, not contributing to the rise in population
at a later date, not consuming anymore food, energy, or space; and
I'll lower the unemployment rate at the same time -- all by suicide!!
Pretty effective little act, isn't it?
As for your earlier point about you paying for this and that, what
about the jobs that I create in the insurance, health care, and
burial industries?  Not to mention the work afforded to florists (assuming
someone likes me enough to send flowers to either the hospital and/or
the funeral), the minister who reads my eulogy, the lawyers who squabble
over my estate, the coroner who does the autopsy... I could go on for
days!!
I think I'll go off myself right now; what a great feeling to be
benefiting others!!

One problem with the above solution is the difficulty in determining
whether or not seat-belts would have an advantageous effect or not.
Also, what happens when I hit someone (my fault) and they didn't have
a seat belt on? Am I less liable because they didn't wear one?
The new trend of mandatory seat-belt laws is so ridiculous! 
My home state of North Carolina is having their law go into 
effect Oct. 1. I am a habitual seat-belt user but I'm almost
ready to not wear them past Oct. 1. I think it's just another
excuse for police to inspect vehicles.
I fully support mandatory child restraint laws, however.
The difference: kids can't responsibly decide whether or
not to wear them and shouldn't be penalized by death for 
having bone-headed parents.

I believe that if a seat belt user is involved in an accident, the selt
belt will stretch enough that investigators can easily tell the selt belt
has been through an accident.
I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.

and non-user) would be a good idea.
It is claimed that it is easy to cheat.  In most accidents it
should be easy to tell.  A significant number of non-users end
up dead.  Others are unconscious.  Some are thrown clear of the
car, or across the car to the other side.  Others would be too
dazed to think of buckling up afterwards.  The nature of the
injuries would often be decisive.  For example, if a person's
forehead is caved in from hitting the dash the force of the
accident would probably cause belt bruises on wearers.
Showering glass particles would probably leave a shadow where
the belt is.  Patterns of blood on clothing and the belt would
indicate a lot to an investigator.
Even if people did successfully cheat some of the time, the
benefit in terms of lowered premiums to belt wearers would still
be sufficient to be desirable.
I am sure the insurance companies have statistics on how much
cost is incurred in paying to people in accidents who are
wearing seatbelts vs. those not wearing.  This would form the
basis for differential premiums, which I think would be rather
large.  Those carrying ""belted"" policies who are injured while
not wearing belts could be paid out at a rate proportional to
the differential.  Policies could be offered with four options:
(1) unbelted driver and passengers, (2) belted passengers,
unbelted driver, (3) belted driver, unbelted passengers, and (4)
belted driver and passengers.  The same differential payouts
could apply, although I think it would be advisable to only
offer two options depending on the driver wearing or not wearing
a belt and pay out for passengers regardless, since a passenger
often would not know what kind of policy the driver carries and
could in any case be purposely mislead by the driver.
The argument that requiring occupants to wear seatbelts
infringes on their freedom is often buttressed by analogy to
risky things like hang-gliding.  While I am less in favour of
seatbelt legislation as time goes by, (especially when choices
can be offered as in insurance options), I would like to refute
the argument.  The analogy is not strictly applicable since it
is impossible to hang-glide without hang-gliding but it is
possible to sit in a moving car wearing seat-belts.
The point that the foolishness of non-users costs all of us has
not been made strongly enough.  By far the greatest cost to
society is the loss of productivity and creativity from the
injured and the dead.  Of course, anyone has the right to be
unproductive and uncreative.
Seatbelts on drivers help them maintain their position at the
controls and therefore lessen the chance that they will lose
control after primary collisions or unforeseen gyrations (i.e.
skids).  Thus they lessen the chance that they will hit oncoming
traffic or pedestrians thereby injuring or killing innocent
bystanders.","BqLiEtCGqQgJ",1,1985-07-30,1,0

>I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.
        I'm not to sure about that,  but  wouldn't  the  injuries  the
        person  wearing  the  seatbelt be identifibly different from a
        person who was  not  wearing  a  seatbelt?  In  a  high  speed
        collision I would think a person wearing a seatbelt would have
        bruises across the waist and  chest  where  the  straps  were.
        Also  a  person  wearing  a seatbelt would be unlikely to have
        suffered head injuries.
        Overall the idea of not paying off accident victim who weren't
        wearing  seatbelts  doesn't  strike  me as very practical.  It

This is true. If fact, If you are in a moderately severe accident it is
recommended (at least by consumer reports) that you replace your seatbelts
because they cannot absorb a second shock as well and could possibly fail.

From experience, I can testify that this is true. It's surprising the kind of
evidence that a trained investigator can find. 
I had an accident where I was rear-ended by a car massing more than twice
mine, traveling about 35-50 MPH upon impact. I had my left-turn signal going
(and my brakes on -OUCH!-), which was verified by the particular way the
remnants of the bulb's filaments deposited themselves upon the remnants of
the bulb!
Anyway, why couldn't the insurance company simply nullify the policy if
the owner of the policy sustained injuries that wouldn't occur if he had
been wearing his belt? (I know, this merely narrows the margin where it
is questionable, yet it becomes pretty small.) I dislike paying higher
premiums because other people don't wear their belts.

    They don't even need to *try* to verify which of their customers actually
wears their seat belts.  All they'd have to do is to offer two types of
insurance: seat-belted and non-seatbelted.  The only difference would be that
seat-belted would cost less, and wouldn't pay for injuries caused by not
wearing seat belts.  As <someone> above points out, there should be big
differences in the types of injuries which occur so that a non-belted
driver using belted insurance wouldn't be able to fool anyone by putting the
belt on after the accident.

Points are well taken.  Being basically a libertarian by nature, I had
thought of the insurance non-payment plan as an alternative to the intrusive
nature of a seat belt law, but couldn't come up with a counter to the
""buckling up"" after the fact argument.
However, it does seem that from a legislative point of view, a variation
on the original argrument could be used.  Might not litigants argue that
they really did have their seat belts on, but the accident wasn't severe
enough to stretch them?  This is all promising, but I think we need
more information, and possibly a body of case law, to convince legislators...

Okay Bob, since I have a financial interest in your attitudes
and lifestyle, I expect to be able to influence your attitudes
and your lifestyle. Please submit to me (address below) a detailed
account of your personal habits. Please include such information
as:
	1. Eating habits (I don't want you to eat foods that

If the accident wasn't severe enough to stretch the seat belts,
then the medical damages ought to be very low.
If litigant's face is broken from hitting the windshield, even a jury is
unlikely to believe the seat belt was actually used. (where seat belt
means combination lap/shoulder belt)

In some states you are.  California used to be one, but I'm not sure if  it
still  is.  The  concept  involved  is  ""contributory negligence"".  If they

auto-dialed Jerry Falwell's 800 number hundreds of times a day for eight
months. For those who have missed news reports, this is the text of a piece
written for the Washington Post. All facts are current as of Jan. 7. I pass it
along with no comment...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	By the Washington Post
|
|	ATLANTA -- For now, at least, the Rev. Jerry Falwell has exorcised the
Demon Dialer.
|	But an angry computer commando, as a protest against TV evangelists,
vows to keep right on bedeviling the $100 million fund-raising machine of the
Moral Majority (or the Liberty Federation, as Falwell recently announced his
group will be called) with his $200 Atari home computer.
|	``I'll give you a demonstration,'' said Edward Johnson, 46, a
bespectacled computer consultant, pecking away at a keyboard in his
one-bedroom walk-up apartment here.
|	That activates his modem's auto-dailer. Bleep, bleep, bleep goes the
video arcade echo on his speaker phone as his Atari rings up Falwell's world
headquarters in Lynchburg, Va.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says an operator. ``Can I help you?''
|	Johnson grinned. His computer is programmed to tie up the line for 30
seconds, then it hangs up and dials again, as it has every 30 seconds, 24
hours a day, seven days a week, for the last eight months. ``Here we go
again,'' he said, and the computer dials 
1-800-446-5000
.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says the operator. ``Help you?'' Click.
|	``You can tell by the tone of voice they're not too happy,'' he said.
|	Indeed, Falwell officials estimate their first high-tech protester
cost them close to $1 million in lost pledges on a blessed WATS line, which
fields some 1 million calls a year, before Southern Bell detectives ordered
Johnson to hang up on Dec. 20 or face criminal charges -- using the telephone
to harass is a federal felony. The besieged switchboard raises at least half
of Falwell's $100 million budget, used to support a TV ministry, missionary
work, Bible study, an anti-abortion crusade and the like.
|	``He has robbed the poor and needy of many thousands of dollars,''
said Falwell in a press released that warned others who would do ``injury to
the cause of Christ by similar illegal acts.''
|	But Johnson accuses TV evangelists of persuading elderly viewers to
part with money they can ill afford to spend, buying religious trinkets and
false hope while the on-the-air preachers use their tax-free status to
subsidize and promote often incendiary views.
|	``They're making millions because there aren't any laws to protect the
gullible from such a powerful medium,'' said Johnson, who says he nearly lost
his family farm to TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggert.
|	After one rip-roaring TV sermon, he said, his 68-year-old mother, Mary
Johnson of Sylvester, was ready to sign over the family's 150 acres in south
Georgia. A virtual shut-in, she lives alone on land his father, who died 12
years ago, once planted with soybeans, peanuts and corn. But Johnston stepped
in and, along with an older brother, Raymond, talked her out of it.
|	``She once bought two Singer sewing machines from different salesmen
in the same week,'' he said.
|	Johnson's crusade began one Sunday morning, April 7, when, he
remembers, Jimmy Swaggert on a local affiliate accused gays of ``spreading
AIDS like flies'' at bathhouses.
|	A political activist and card-carrying member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, Johnson got angry. ``He was implying that you should treat
those people like flies,'' he said. He considered it unfair and inflammatory.
And, of course, he almost lost the farm.
|	He wrote the Federal Communications Commission to complain. He tapped
a second computer to mount a letter-writing campaign to congressmen and
senators. And he dispatched copies of those letters to Falwell, who had his
name. But it would take Falwell eight months to unearth Atari Central.
|	He targeted Falwell because he's the ``most politically active'' TV
evangelist, and his mother had sent him hundreds of dollars. ``If we get
Falwell, Swaggart will fall of his own weight,'' said Johnson, who is single
and lives alone.
|	Weaned on old-time religion growing up in Worth County, Ga., he joined
the Air Force out of high school, worked for a large computer firm as an
engineer, then settled into consulting.
|	He has nothing against religion, he says, but he compares his beliefs
more to Spinoza and Einstein than to fundamentalist TV preachers.
|	But what better way to protest than slow down their collection plate,
he argues. So he began dialing 1-800 ...
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' said the operator. ``Tap the phone if you
can hear me, honey. We'll pray for you.''
|	``At first,'' said Johnson, ``they thought I was deaf.''
|	For a time, he tried debating the operators to keep them busy. ``But
it was always, `God bless you,' or `God loves you.' They were so sweet, I kind
of felt sorry for them. They were programmed to be nice.''
|	So it was back to the computer. ``A computer is totally impersonal,''
he said. ``It can't feel sorry for you. It's relentless. It shows no mercy.''
|	Toward the end, operators were answering the dead lines: ``Edward
Johnson, is that you?''
|	They stopped thinking the caller was deaf.
|	``My computer kept the pressure on,'' he said. ``It had a great
demoralizing effect.''
|	On Nov. 15, Falwell officials reported trouble on the line. ``They
came to us with a simple technical problem,'' recalled Wayne Jackson, an AT&T
spokesman. ``They were getting hangups and lines jammed.''
|	Technicians ruled out a glitch and put on a tracer. It was touchy
going. Johnson's Atari was programmed to dial and hang up fast, to avoid
leaving fingerprints. But AT&T got its man.
|	On Dec. 17 ``we figured out it was coming from 404 area code,'' said
Jackson, and officials in Atlanta were alerted. Three days later, Southern
Bell security took over and Johnson was identified as the high priest of the
first church of Atari protest.
|	``It's amazing,'' said Richard Miles, a company spokesman. ``As big as
Atlanta is, within 30 minutes, we had tracked him down.'' The phone company
gave him a choice: stop calling Falwell or lose his telephone. Johnson pulled
his own plug.
|	Will Falwell take the Demon Dialer to court? ``Our attorneys are
considering the options,'' said Duane Ward, his PR director.
|	Before his computer sniping, Johnson protested such local issues as a
road for Jimmy Carter's presidential library that cut through his neighborhood
-- until demonstrators stopped it. From his window, he gazed at idled
earthmovers for inspiration, their cabs spray-painted, ``Long Live the
Trees!''
|	Suddenly Johnson, who once lived a life of quiet resignation, is,
however briefly, a media star. He attributes his inspiration to rage.
|	He says it's not over yet.
|	``I'm encouraging all hackers to reach out and touch Jerry Falwell,''
he said. ``If he's the Moral Majority, this is a good way of taking a vote.''","zx5yshZgQQkJ",1,1986-01-13,-17,13

I've fallen into this class.  It's a grey area as to what is harassing,
but it is almost certain that if someone tells you that you are harassing
them, and you continue to do it, that you are harassing them.
