        It is specious for another reason as well, it is *false*.
There is no significant excess brain capacity, it is all used for
*something*. Just because only ~5% is used for *consiousness* does not
mean the rest is without function.

This is an interesting topic to me, not for the evolution vs.
creationism aspect of it, but because we take it for granted that
intelligence is always a good thing, whereas it may not be.
By Werner's reasoning we ought to have two or three brains, just in
case.  (Why keep all the stuff in one place?)  I wonder if there aren't
cases where having all those extra nerves is just asking for trouble.
It would seem to me (naively) that nerve paths provide a sort of
interstate highway map for some kinds of viruses to follow, and the
richer a nervous system you have the more inroads they can find.  (I'm
thinking of herpesviruses; I had shingles about ten years ago.)
I seem to remember hearing about some research in which someone showed
that intelligence is selected against in rats.  Anybody know about
this?  (Some people will probably suggest it is also selected against
where my family comes from.)  There are certainly constraints against
brain size, e.g. an infant's brain at birth is limited in size by the
size of the birth canal.  Stephen Jay Gould says one reason why the
human baby is so helpless when born is that the human infant is a sort
of fetus that got out of the womb too early.  If it stayed in until it
was as developed as its mammalian counterparts it could not be born
without killing its mother.  Anyway, there is a price to be paid for
all this excess brain size.
As for the 5%-95% argument, I don't take it too seriously.  If somebody
came to me and said, `You're only using 5% of your brain, so let us
scoop out the other 95%,' I'd probably decline the offer.  I may be
only using 5%, but I want ALL of it.  (In fact, if you have any extra
lying around, please send it to me.)

   T.J. Palmer was an ignorant, but observant individual.  He lacked the
training necessary to truly understand and explain the results he got.
Fortunately for the world, Chiropractic schools no longer teach the Palmer
Philosophy.
   No competent chiropractor that I am aware of claims that chiropractic 
can or will cure *ANYTHING*, much less everything.  That bogus claim is
a direct result of the AMA deliberately using out-dated chiropractic
materials (from Palmer's time) in their smear campaigns.  Recall that
the AMA is the same group that opposed the licensing of, among others,
physchologists, dentists, podiatrists.  The AMA has lost any number of
law suits brought against it by the Chiropractors.  Many insurance 
companies (including quite a few state Worker's Compensation carriers)
actually prefer chiropractic treatment for patients with back injuries
(after screening by an orthopedist for breakage or other orthopedic
damage).  They achieve better results, faster, and for less money.
As I said in an earlier posting, compare the annual premiums paid by
MDs and DCs for malpractive insurance...this tells you something.
   IN late 1981, I suffered a severe compressive injury to my spine.  I
went to hospitals, and doctors galore.  Most of them did nothing, claiming
there was nothing wrong, and all that pain was ""in my imagination""  Cute.
I am *SO* glad that they took those AMA required courses in mind reading.
In any case, none of them were able to provide me with *ANY* relief.
After a few years of crippling chronic pain, and massive muscular spasms,
I reluctantly went to a chiropractor.  After 2-3 sessions, my level of
pain was down considerably, the muscle spasms, while still resent, were
not as bad, and I was somewhat more functional.  I also wasn't being doped 
out of my mind on muscle relaxers and pain killers.  (as a minor side
issue, I had no money or insurance at the time.  This chiropractor was
treating a friend, who had talked to him about me.  He insisted that I come
in for treatment.  He said that I would surely have more money someday,
but that treatment was essential.  He waited 3 years for that money, treatig
me the whole time.  Never complained about the money.  How many MDs would
do that?)
   Most chiropractors are honest, well trained healers, practicing a method
that is proven to provide relief, and is *SOME* cases has produced what
at least appear to be ""cures"".  Unfortunately, there are quacks in every
sector of the health care field.  The AMA just *LOVES* to publicize the
occasional quack chiropractor...too bad they don't put as much energy
into publicizing their own quacks when discovered.
   Modern chiropractic is not for everyone.  If you have a backache, or
a neck ache, or leg pains, and your MD can't do anything but provide you
with mind-dulling drugs that provide only minimal and temporary relief,
then you should consider seeing a chiropractor.  They *MAY* be able to
help.
   Don't fall victim to the money-grubbing power politics of the AMA.
Check the facts for yourself.  Remember that the AMA is the organization
that owns millions of $$$ in tobacco stock, and refused to support the
Surgeon General's warnings on cigarette packages.  According to studies
I have seen, the official AMA postions seldom represent the opinions
of the member MDs.  Often, according to these studies, they represent as
few as 5-10% of the membership.
   Doctors are human beings, not gods.  Western medical ""science"" has no
valid claim to being the only correct or effective means of achieving
health care.  When I need an MD, I see one.  When I need a chripractor, I
see one.

Let me start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of my SO. I myself have
never been to a chiropracter.
Last August, he (my SO) had excrutiating lower back pain and neck pain. A 
good night's rest had become impossible, his sinuses were frequently clogged
in the morning. He would also experience ""pounding"" (his word) headaches
that would come on in a flash. He works at Ft. Dix; the doctor there recommended
pain killers and compresses, and time off work. Well, Dave *hates* pills and
drugs, and couldn't afford ""time off work."" He works in an office, no heavy
physical labor, so he couldn't see what difference that would make. He went to
a chiropracter (one recommended to him) who took X-rays which showed vertabrae
in the neck and back that were *severely* out of kilter. Dave saw the X-rays
himself, was skeptical that it could be so bad, and actually paid for another
set through Ft. Dix just to make sure the chiro wasn't pulling a fast one.
Sure enough, same result.
He started going to the chiropracter three times a week for several months.
Each session would consist of spinal manipulation (back cracking). He felt
better after the first few weeks. Even during the height of fall pollen and
dry leaf season, he had NO stuffy noses in the morning. The headaches were
greatly reduced as well.
I live with my SO; I saw first-hand the day-to-day improvements. Up to that
point, I had harbored a vague distrust of chiros. Now I've seen one case where
a chiro was a definite help, and NO drugs were used. I should also mention that
periodically he was re-examined and subsequent X-rays were taken which did show
improvements in the out-of-line vertabrae. He is now down to one visit per 
month, and should be through after one or two more visits.
 
Neither one of us believes everything that chiros claim. But as for helping
everyday back troubles, we would both try a chiro first.

Once I had an intense muscle spasm in my back that muscle relaxants didn't
do anything for.  It was extremely painful.  I went to my mother's chiro
and in 15 minutes I walked out feeling great.  The spasm was gone and it
never came back.
The only other cases I've seen are people at my karate studio who see
chiros.  I have seen several people with hip problems go to chiros and
their flexibility has increased tremendously.  Their high kicks are now
much stronger, faster and higher in my opinion. The difference is visibly
obvious, and impressive, to me. Also,  they claim that the pain in their 
hip joints is now gone. (We don't advocate high kicks for tactical reasons, 
but that's a entirely different subject!! :-)).
I have developed similar problems with my hip joints.  The joints are painful
when I'm sitting in a chair and spread my knees apart (bad sign eh?) and I
develop laower back pain when I take a fairly long walk.  I'm considering
a chiro,  but I will see a MD first to rule out things like arthritis, 
obvious injury, etc.
I feel that chiros are great if they STAY WITHIN THEIR DOMAIN.  When they
start trying to treat diseases, etc.  they then become quacks.

One of the things I forgot to add in my recent posting was the time I went
to my chiropractor for my regular ""maintenance"" (adjust the timing, change
the spark plugs... :-)), and I happened to have had a lingering headache.
When I told the chiro about it, and described where the headache was, he
immediately asked, ""Are you on a diet?  Or have you recently changed your
eating habits?""  Well, it so happened that I had just gone on 2nd shift at
work, and I was eating at all kinds of weird hours.  The chiro kind of
pressed down on my stomach, and the headache pain was noticeably diminished.
To avoid a recurrence, I merely ""regularized"" my eating hours.
People have said in past articles that chiros don't seem to know that a
back has a front attached to it.  Perhaps that's because they're going
to the wrong chiropractor.

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I read in a recent article on ""Orgasm"" in Discover magazine (or one of
the clones) that the vaginal lubricant produced during arousal in women
is simply 'filtered blood serum' ie, blood cells are removed. This would
probably not remove the virus. How this enters the mans body in

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

I appreciate your sentiment, but let's keep some perspective.  It's  a  lot
easier  and  cheaper  to  make a soldier than a doctor.  Also, the level of
intelligence required to be a doctor is found in a much smaller  percentage
of the population than that required for a soldier.
I suspect the figures even out considerably if you compare dollar costs  or
times  required  for  training  soldiers  and  doctors. (You could even try
summing IQ's (-: ).
A more relevant question is:  Can one doctor adequately serve 1,050 people?
My  understanding  is  there's currently a surplus of doctors in the United
States.  It's the uneven distribution that causes problems.

Again, the wrong question is implied.  More relevant:  Would spending  more
than  $140 million dollars annually significantly speed up the finding of a
cure for AIDS?  I'd cheerfully trade a couple of F-16's  for  a  cure,  but
it's not at all clear that such a tradeoff exists.

	No, $140M in a year probably wouldn't cure AIDS, but one tenth of that
could vaccinate every child in America fully, which would probably save just
as many lives.

	I'm not saying that there should be one doctor for every 28 people,

little.

Not to say that Craig's sentiment is incorrect, but the figures I have
seen for the cost of an F-16 are quite different. According to ""The
Arsenal of Democracy"", we have paid the following prices for F-16s:
1979	145 @ $ 9.482 M
1980	175 @ $ 9.465 M
1981	120 @ $14.088 M
1982	120 @ $17.608 M
1983	120 @ $18.704 M
1984	144 @ $17.717 M
1985	150 @ $24.900 M
Two F-16s shouldn't be more than $50 to $70 M in 1986.
Some of the prices we have charged other
countries for F-16s include:
Iran
	160 @ $14.844 M, 1978, including a contribution to F-16 R&D costs
Israel
	75  @ $15.453 M, 1978
	55  @ $23.575 M, 1979
Netherlands
	30  @ $ 7.199 M, 1980
Pakistan
	15  @ $14.5   M, 1981

Note also that, if you know you do not have AIDS or any other
infectious disease, you help increase the healthy blood supply by
donating!  (And the nurses will help you determine what might be
disqualifying.)
For recent, good information on AIDS and other diseases that are

I recall that the Red Cross won't take your blood if you have taken an
antimalarial drug and traveled in a region where malaria is prevalent.
I don't recall which of the 2 conditions they specify.  So, my question
is:  Which of the following conditions makes your blood *unacceptable*?
	(1) travel to a malaria infested area?
	(2) use of chloroquin (or premiquin (sp?))?
	(3) use of fansidar (YA antimalarial)?

        There was a time when the ARC would not accept blood
from anyone who had taken any cold remedy containing
quinine. I had a had a bout with bronchitis (back in the
50s) and had been given a Rx containing quinine to help stop
the cough, and several months later tried to donate blood.
The ARC said no go - even atropine (I guess belladonna, too)
was a no-no. Wonder how long that stuff stays in the system?
Has this rule been changed?

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to
the Press conference AND all three patients died in the week following.

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's

it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

things, peroxide, is simply illadvised, bad folk-medicine, something we
certainly don't need right now when it comes to AIDS.  There are lots of
agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have

Way back when I thought about getting into medicine, I was working at M. D.
Anderson in Houston.  3-west was the lung cancer wing.  The smoke concentra-
tion in the waiting rooms in that wing were the highest in the building.
Seems everyone was so NERVOUS visiting their friend/relative that just
had a lung or larnyx removed that they needed SOMEthing to calm down --
like a cigarette.  I suggested that a lung which had been removed from a
patient by dried (run air to expand and dry it) and then displayed in
a case in the waiting room.  I was told that would be beyond the bounds
of good taste.  I guess that cancerous, tar-filled lungs are OK, as long
as they are on the inside....

Spencer Gifts and other similar specialty shops offer a ""lung ashtray,""
which is a plain ashtray with a clear hollow plastic model of a lung
suspended over it to catch the smoke and cloud up. A very graphic
deterrent to smokers (at least, to those who think). These should be
required in any doctor's or hospital's waiting room.

No.  These only make people who are already non-smokers feel smug.
When I was a smoker they actually served to remeind me of how much
I wanted a cigarette.   Perhaps, as dave suggests, I was a non-thinking
smoker.   Still, the objective is to make all smokers quit, isn't it,
whether they are non-thinking or thinking.

[DAVE] Thanks for a very interesting insight. If a lung ashtray only
served to remind you of how much you wanted a cigarette, obviously my
suggestion is not going to work as a deterrent. My implication that
""thinking smokers"" would be deterred is also disproven by your
observations, since obviously you were thinking at the time you were
reminded of how bad you wanted a cigarette. Apparently the desire for
a cigarette is not a logically based desire, and attempts to deal with
it logically (i.e., ""convince you it is harmful and you will quit"") will
not work. But this raises the question, What IS the best way to deal
with it? Or is there ANYTHING a non-smoker can do to influence a smoker
to quit; perhaps it must be the smoker's decision, and there is no way
to influence it from the outside?

Bingo!
If someone who smokes quits, it will be at a time of his choosing and
for his own reasons.  When someone assails them with the ""Smoking is
bad for you because..."" tirade, they think, ""Boy, this person thinks
I'm so stupid that I don't know all of this.  If he thinks I'm going
to pay any attention to such an arrogant and holier-than-thou jerk, he's
got another think coming.""
In other words, all that will happen if you spout off about the perils
of smoking is that you will totally discredit yourself in the eyes of
the person that you're supposedly trying to help.  (I say ""supposedly"",
because there really are a lot of arrogant and holier-than-thou jerks
out there who don't really want to help at all; they just want to
denigrate smokers so that they'll feel superior).
Okay, so what *can* you do?  First, examine your own motives.  Honestly.
If you feel superior to those who smoke, then kindly keep your mouth
shut (most ex-smokers fall into this category).  Your conceited braying
is obvious to almost everyone, and smokers in particular find it down-
right funny that you think that you're better than they are.
If you don't like the idea that maybe smokers are actually *enjoying*
doing something that you personally would never ever do, then you too
are requested to keep your notions to yourself and your kind.
If you don't like being exposed to smoke, you might try the almost
always ignored route of simply asking the smokers that you deal with to
be considerate of you.  Insist that restaurants have a non-smoking
section, since you can hardly be expected to ask every stranger at
every nearby table to be considerate.  (It probably wouldn't work,
anyway).
If you're concerned about smoking as a ""public health menace"", then
concentrate on *prevention*.  A lot has already been done in this area,
especially on television where ads have been banned and most characters
don't smoke.
If you are concerned about the health of someone special to you, then
you have a difficult time ahead.  Your best bet is to *never* bring up
the subject of smoking; that person already knows damn well about the
hazards.  Instead, make sure that the ""someone special"" knows that
they *are* special to you, and that their health is something that you
care very deeply about.  But this must be communicated subtly, in a
*caring* tone, not in a *lecturing* tone.  It will take a long time;
maybe months, maybe years.  But eventually they will decide *on their
own* that they should give up the habit because it endangers something
that *you* care about.

I agree wholeheartedly.  The ""reminder"" factor is one of the biggest
obstacles to those trying to quit as well.  This goes for both positive
and negative reminders.  When you are trying to quit, you really want to
forget that there are such things as cigarettes and tobacco.

I was about to followup in the same line, but Doug's posting says it
much more clearly than I ever could.  It is the people that you are
close to, who care about you -- that you love -- who have the most
impact on your ability or inability to stop smoking.

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

I knew AIDS wasn't carried by mosquitos when made the first posting.
Let me restate the ""what if"":  ""What if another disease as nasty as AIDS
comes along, which CAN be spread by mosquitos?"".

This has been checked out by the CDC, and apparently there is no risk 
for transmission of HTLV-III via an insect vector.  I'm not sure of the
reference, but I think it's a recent issue of JAMA, in the ""Leads from the
MMWR"" section.
By the way, the virus is inactivated by high and low pH and by exposure to a
temperature of 56 C for ten minutes.  Most standard disinfectants (Lysol,
Clorox) and halogenated hand soaps will also inactivate the virus.

You are assuming that the person you entrust your care to has not misrepresented
his abilities as a healer.  The point is that a large amount of damage may be
done by someone who is misrepresenting him/herself to a small, but nonetheless
gullible segment of society.  Also remember that how gullible a potential
victim is depends on how fast a talker the ""healer"" in question is.  Although
the number of charlatans at large may be small, the potential damage that they
can cause is large, hence the requirement of licensure for the physician.
Remember - I'm not arguing for taking away the right of an INFORMED consumer
of health care to go to who they want, but I think the potential for abuse of
an UNINFORMED consumer makes licensure necessary.

	It is not illegal to seek medical care from a non-licensed ""healer"".
It is only illegal to offer to GIVE medical care without benefit of a license.
	The question I have is 'Why would you even WANT to entrust your broken
arm to an unlicensed practitioner?'  Without even being a board certified
Orthopedist, I can think of at least a dozen complications of a broken arm
that could cripple one for life or even kill. A license is just a form of
consumer protection, nothing more.

Sorry Craig, you missed my point.           
First---What about the Good Samaritan Law in regards to accidents. A person
        is offering to GIVE medical care. Is that person breaking the law?
        If so why do they do it and run the risk of lawsuits?
Second--It is not whether I WANT to, but WHY CAN'T I? I agree it is not a

In some instances, across the country, the unlicensed practice can be a
felony.  There have even been felonious instances by a licensed doctor.

The Good Samaritan Law was passed to prevent the increasingly common occurence
of normal people, say giving someone CPR, and then getting sued for breaking
a few ribs.  Based on that information, the logic fails.
	Besides, the good samaritan is offering to give First Aid, not
comprehensive medical care.  But the fact that they had to pass the good
samaritan laws proved that at least some lawyers found it profitable to argue
that yes, they were breaking the law. (I don't agree, and I also believe in
altruism as a motive.)

	Didn't you read what I said. It's not illegal at all.  I even kept the
line in above [ if you can go back a screenful]
	It may be legal, but it sure ain't smart -- especially for the example
chosen (broken bone).

The distinction between LICENSING and CERTIFICATION is a legal
one having little to do with the degree of preparation or skill.
A license gives you the right to do something that would be a crime
for the un-licenced to do.  A certification gives you the right to
do something and claim exceptional expertise at doing it when
others are allowed to do it, but are not allowed to
claim exceptional expertise at doing it.  There may also be
some limitations on the ability of the un-certificated to practice
in some situations.
In the area of medicine, to offer treatment without a licence
is a crime.  Under certification, it would not be a crime; though
taking the offer might be stupid ... :-)
While it is usually the case that both licensing and certification
require some formal training and/or examination; the distinction
between them rests on the penalty for practice when not blessed
by having the paper.  Physicians are licenced, not certified.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the

One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now

The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of

black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

for HTLV-3.
	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

Oooh! An attack!  Good.
Here's the story.  
On several occasions you have made reference to articles in the popular
media (Newsweek, CBS) on various aspects of health.  You have then gone
on to exposit your favorite theories and statistics as if the articles
you refer to presented them.  Often the articles or reports you look to
for support specifically *contradict* your claims.
I consider this practice both dishonest and deceptive.  You can at least
stop essentially misquoting the sources you claim to represent, as with
the toxicity level of mercury in amalgum filling.  If I find you dishonest
in this respect, how am I to believe your less substantiated claim?
Certainly not without sources.  
Remember, *you* are the one offering cures, not me.  I only report what I
see and hear that I feel you have misrepresented.  I am not a doctor nor
any kind of health practitioner.  I am simply someone leery of snake-oil
salesmen who is trying to do the best for his health as he can.  I expect
those offering panacaea's to do a better job with facts than you seem to
be capable of.
>I am continually amazed at the low opinion some readers of the net
>have of the intelligence, honesty, sincerity, morality (I was even
>accused of a LIE) & general capability, of professionals who care
>enough to share their knowledge on the net.
You have been the one accusing AMA related physicians of the same sort of
thing!  I see you like being on the receiving end of that sort of cr*p
about as much as Bill Oliver does.  Perhaps you will begin to tone down
your own accusations.

This tells me nothing.  I've known *lots* of perennial graduate students.
What is the *source* (and the precise levels found) of your data on
mercury toxicity in amalgum fillings.  According to the CBS report, which
you originally cited, even Dr. Morgan admits that this is only a problem
with people particularly sensitive to heavy-metal poisoning (I don't know
what that means, but it seems different from what you are saying.)

Like I said originally, the ADA (or whatever professional Dentist's
association) *has* been studying this problem and long before your
lawyer friend wrote a letter.  Obviously, being self-serving sons of
b*tches, they don't count, right :->  They do disagree with you, or
at least according to the CBS report.
>My first impulse was to smile at Byron Howes comments.  However, he
>writes like a thinking person---he is just seriously underinformed.
I don't claim to be informed.  I'm just noting that while you and I
claim to have seen the same CBS report, your article said very different
things about it than I saw.  The same happened with the Newsweek report
about sugar.  You made very different claims for the article than were
actually in the text of the article.
In what *other* ways are you making misstatements of fact that I don't
know about if my poor feeble underinformed brain can spot these.
>He makes his comments based on the flimsiest amount of information

I haven't the faintest idea what your motives are, and I don't care.
I'm only afraid that serious damage (not to mention expense) is going
to be incurred from misinformation, from any quarter.
> Mr. Howes assumption that I am a fool reflects
>more on him than it does on me.  I have found it much safer to assume

I think Bill Oliver has noted that simply isn't true.  You impune the
ability and integrity of all AMA related doctors all the time.  I'll
let the readers of this newsgroup decide whether I am a fool or not.
That is hardly relevant.
> That attitude has placed me much closer to

Right.  A direct line on the truth.

I routinely distrust individuals unwilling to make their complete arguments
publicly. I've been through this with the fundamentalists and the creationists
and I'll go through it with you.  If you believe what you have to say is
important, than back it up.  As one of the posters to net.origins is very
fond of saying ""extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof"" not simply
your word or promises of references.

What time is this, Walt?  Again, are you seriously interested in people's
health and well being or merely proving yourself ""superior"" to mainstream
medicine.  Understand, I have no disagreement with Holistic medicine or
the concept thereof.  Some of your ideas may be accurate.  There is
possibly much to be learned there.
So long as you continue to misrepresent others, however, in an effort to
""sell"" your position I find I am unable to distinguish truth from falsehood
in what you say.  I certainly am not going to take you very seriously if
I feel I have found evidence (which I do) that you are selling me a bill
of goods with little substance.

There are four stages of societal response to the discovery of
radically new concepts (in this order):     
     #1  Ignore it and it will go away.
     #2  Ridicule
     #3  Attack 
     #4  Total acceptance:  ""Well, that's obvious!  We knew that all
         the time!
Twice now, Steve has ridiculed something I have placed on the net;
only to have strong evidence to the contrary be published within a few
days of his unsupported position.  His response has been to regress
(like the child who reverts to bedwetting when the new baby is brought
home from the hospital) from the relatively advanced societal response
of ridicule to the relatively more primitive strategy of ignoring.
Sorry Steve,  you're going to have to work harder and harder to ignore
what is rushing, like an avalanche, into all our lives.  Just today,
in one of the many Medical Journals I read every day, in the special
section called Medical Ethics (appropriate, I think), Thomas Preston,
MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine
& Chief of Cardiology at Pacific Medical Center, joined my side.  In a
one page statement,""Palliative Care No Match for Prevention of
Disease"", one more outstanding clinician points out exactly my
position: Reference--Medical World News/September 9, 1985 (page 19).
The same day two more articles in the same vein: Family Practice News/
September 1-14, 1985, page 16, ""Medicare Asked to Take Part in
Promoting 'Wellness'"" & page 18 (same issue) ""Promoting Healthier
Life-Styles Challenging, Rewarding"".
Even the AMA has already reached the last of the four societel
responses.  In American Medical News/September 13, 1985, the
announcement is made that the third special supplement to Newsweek by
the AMA appears in the Sept. 9th edition, titled: ""To your health!
Building and keeping a healthy body.""  The supplement covers such
topics as nutrition, exercise, and disease prevention.  The only
professional national medical organization that specializes in this
field is the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA).  For the
past 7 years, since the beginning of the AHMA, the AMA has done as
much as it legally could to stifle it.  The very things the AMA is now
claiming for its own has been practiced for many years by Holistic
Medical Practitioners.  Of course, the AHMA is now practicing an
advanced form of what was known 7 years ago.  It will be years before
the conventional medical practitioner catches up though catch up they
will eventually.  It should already be considered malpractice to offer
less than is known.  Eventually that may be what forces many MDs to go
back to learn all this new stuff.  
Trying to pitch the offerings to the net to satisfy the lowest common
denominator would be a sad thing for the rest of us.  Maybe we can
create a ""special class for slow learners like the Steve Dyers"".

I have stated twice, Walt, that my facts were taken from the articles
in Newsweek you claim to have read and the CBS (and CNN) news reports
you claim to have seen.  I submit that either by deliberation or by
simple inability to grasp ideas you have misrepresented the medical
findings in those very same sources to the network and perhaps to
yourself.  Whatever the reason, I find this behavior in a health pro-
fessional very frightening.
If it makes you feel any better, I wouldn't entrust myself to an
AMA-type doctor who was incapable of correctly drawing simple
conclusions either.  (This has nothing to do with the correctness
of the conclusions, but the correctness of the process of drawing
conclusions.)  If I see that a person cannot reliably draw facts
from material I am familiar with, what am I to think about the facts
drawn from material I am not familiar with?

Here is my personal opinion. I have known many people on both
sides of this issue. The unorthodox group is often guilty
of an unscientific approach lacking in logic. The orthodox
group seems to go too far in the other direction, trying to
reduce everything to ""logic and scientific materialism"".
(not that I accuse Steve of this, I just used the above
 as a starting point for this letter.)
I thought that Godel's incompleteness theorems, Quantum
physics and such had blown scientific materialism out of
the water, at least as far as being a ""true"" description
of the world. What the unorthodox approach has in its favor
is often based on personal experience, which tends to be
difficult to treat scientifically.
I think that the orthodox group might benefit from practices
promoting personal experience (perhaps Yoga/meditation, fasting
or whatever), while the unorthodox group might benefit from
a study of logic.

Poor Stoll, so predictable.  What do you think you have been spewing all
over the net with statements like ""RA RA"", ""WHO's LAUGHING NOW?"", and
all the other useless mudslinging articles?
Just ridicule and attack, that's all.
While you have some interesting points to discuss your method of
presentation is that of a raver with a HUGE chip on his shoulder.
I am going to apply #1 to you; I hope you will somehow go away.  I find
your logic VERY offensive, and your narrow-mindedness repungent. I advise
everybody else to add ""reply to WWS"" in their subject line so I can
ignore those postings too.

mean I have to throw the baby out with the bath water. M.D.'s still
have my trust,  one even suggested I see a chiropractor the other
day.  This is in Canada of course, we might have a different breed
of MD's and Chiropractors.

Garbage, Walt, and you know it!  When you stop misrepresenting facts I

distort and downright lie to promote your position, you are going to have
to expect that folks will be suspicious of what you say.  I don't want

Sure, Walt.  All AMA-type physicians were/are against prevention so they
can make big bucks providing useless cures.  Nobody ever looked at
stress as a causative factor in disease until the holistic physicians
came around, nobody was ever aware of dietary factors in disease until
holistic physicians came to be and nobody knew about the relationship
between diet and mood until holistic physicians discovered it.  (The above

You read it here folks.  Say, Walt, how come I learned all of these things
in elementary school -- before the American Holistic Medical Association
came to be.  Looks to me like the situation is reversed:  you, in the name
of the AHMA, are claiming for your own the very thing that have been
practiced for years by members of the AMA.  Again, this is a false repre-
sentation and you probably know it!

Those on the ""orthodox"" side have personal experiences too.
Sometimes these experiences include controlled double blind experiments.
Amazing how the personal experiences of the ""unorthodox"" are almost
never reproducible by non-true believers in that particular

Great idea!  I also vote for net.med.holistic.  Bill could simply
announce in net.med that e.g. ""I have refuted all of this in a new

I would like to clarify my comment, in case there are others like Walt
who may have misinterpreted me.  I was not proposing ""ignoring"" crackpots, as
much as refusing to engage in extended debate.  I have seen too many other
news groups degenerate into such harangues, and net.med is not the place
for this.

Well, I will risk being branded as a heretic and say that the fact
that an experience is not reproducible does not mean it is invalid.
(Unfortunately if one is willing to accept reports of such experiences
one is likely to be victimized by charlatans and/or irrational people.)
Some things may not be susceptible to experimental verification
(isn't there a principle in physics that observing an event changes it?)
I am not rejecting the scientific method. I am surrounded by
these holistic types out here in Northern California and for
years have been trying to get some of them to be more rational.
But I also think they do a lot of good.
I would also like to state that I do not have as much faith
in the representatives of orthodoxy as you seem to. I seem
to recall that some pioneers in science have been put through all
kinds of persecutions before their views became the new orthodoxy.
Perhaps some correct views never were accepted. How do you know?

I don't have any first hand experience with voodoo or wife beating
so I can't endorse those practices. What I was trying to say is
that since reason can only take us so far, techniques for
changing one's state of awareness may be useful in obtaining
new insights.

Unfortunately no-one never claimed that it's the ""true"" description of
the world. All we can say is that so far it works, unlike any other
model of the world that I've ever heard of. Of course choosing a model
based on ""what works"" is part of SM in the first place, but what better

I'm not so sure that noone ever claimed scientific materialism
is a true description of the world. (Isn't something along
those lines part of Marxist doctrine?) But anyway basically what
I was trying to say is that it is a good model (actually quite
an amazingly good model), but that it should be understood as
being a model rather than truth. As you say, choosing a model
based on what works is part of what SM is all about, as I
understand it.
My particular pet theory which I've been trying to integrate
with existing models is rather controversial and has to do
with adding as an axiom the existence of a soul, without saying
anything about God, religion etc. Since this is somewhere
out in left-field as far as most people are concerned I
won't burden you with the details ... (this view is
heretical both to religious and materialistic types ...)
What I like about Godel's theorems, Quantum physics, etc.,
is that they seem to suggest something mysterious is going
on that isn't readily explainable. I like mysteries ...
Apologies to the readers for burdening them with my personal
opinions ... I won't put any more of this in the net.

I am Bill Stoll; Walt Stoll is my father.  I got my Masters in CS at the
University of KY at which I had (and still have) an account.  When
I came to work for AT&T, I discovered USENET.  The discussions in
net.med made me think of him, so I suggested he buy a modem for his
Macintosh and use my old account to join the discussion.  It has
been a lot of fun for him, and I'm proud to see him finally getting
involved with computers.
I have to throw in my 2 cents regarding ""net.med.holistic"".  As Walt
adjusts to ""netiquette"" and the high intelligence of this audience,
I think you will see less public flaming and accusations, and more
facts presented with evidence worthy of discussion.  My somewhat
biased opinion is for people interested in new breakthroughs (and
important ""rediscoveries"") to wait a few months more before giving
him his own newsgroup or unsubscribing to him.

While I certainly agree that this is so, I don't think you can really
fault the physicians.  It is not they who research medical matters;
they can only apply whatever information the researchers provide.
And I can't even fault the researchers, inasmuch as there are still
a number of ""sicknesses"" that I'd rather see cures/prevention for
(AIDS, MS, and cancer to name just a few), rather than have them
spending their time and money on researching ""better wellness"".

Dear Frank,
Holistic Medicine has the cures for your list.  When I practiced
Conventional Medicine alone I had no cures for any of your list.
In addition, the cures for the ills on your list have many powerful

So, don't bite people!  Don't associate with biters.  But don't use this as a
reason to bar non-biters from school.  In my whole school career, I found it
necessary to bite one person -- a teacher who hit first.
If a person at school bites, send the idiot home!  Not because he/she

a child having AIDS attending school, there is a much
greater risk of the child catching what would normally
be a simple childhood disease and not being able to
fight it off.  Take chicken pox as an example.  There once
was a tribe of indians living in the area of northern Iowa
that was wiped out after coming in contact with chicken pox.
The same thing happened in the area of Easter Island some
200 years ago.  So, since chicken pox can kill those
without an immunity, the child with AIDS will have the
same problem.  I feel that putting the child into this
environment would be a greater risk to the child than
that supposed risk to those around the child.  Shoving
a child into the school based on principles is not helping

	Whenever someone asks me how bad AIDS is, I respond, ""Well at least it
isn't as bad as Lassa Fever.""
	It begins with fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a sore throat (just
like a cold.)  However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces every
organ to close shop.
	Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseases
known to man.  It was first described in the early 70s by a group of Columbia
U. researchers.
	The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in a 
missionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.
After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospital
in Jos, where she died the next day.
	Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of the
disease, and a third was deathly ill.  She was flown to New York (prompting
several staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )
and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,
survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.
	Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to study 
additional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing the
epidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,
the first outbreak's final victim.
	(Source: Ten Diseases You Were Better Off Not Knowing About)
	(        G. Thomas, MD and L. Shreiner, MD _That's_Incurable_)
	Lassa Fever is not AIDS.
	However, in a final twist, Suramin, one of the antiviral drugs used
to treat Lassa fever, is currently undergoing clinical trials against the
AIDS virus.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.
I understand your position, but dissagree.  I assume you feel the same.

Since dentists learned that sugar caused cavities they have been in
the forefront of the research involving sugar.  The medical profession
has been ""johnnie come latelies"" in this field.
As far back as 1964 dental research had shown that a moderate dose of
sugar was sufficient to drastically reduce the ""phagocytic index"".
For those of you who don't know:  The phagocytic index is a measure of
how many bacteria a white blood cell ingests in one hour.  It is a
very accurate measure of one form of immunity.  Now that AIDS research
$ has made it possible to measure many aspects of immunity in fine
detail, and sugar has hit the ""big time"" by being on the cover of
Newsweek, I'm sure it won't be long before these studies are repeated
measuring many more parameters.
I will just list the table that summarizes that first study and wait
for the predictable denials from those who still don't want to know:

       1964
This study has, of course, been replicated many times.  The last time
that I am aware of was by Emanual Cheraskin, MD, DDS, who was Chairman
of the department of Dentistry at the University of Alabama Dental
School at the time.  He has gone on to dedicate his life to educating
the public, and any professionals who will listen, of the pervasive
health burdens caused by refined carbohydrates.
The same amount of glucose ingested in an unrefined state (in other
words, with all the 48+ nutrients it grew up with--in the exact
proportion that it existed in nature) causes no reduction in the
phagocytic index.
You know, a grain of wheat is alive.  No matter how long it is in
storage it is slowly running its own ""Krebs cycle""(the same metabolic
cycle we humans use to process all forms of carbohydrates).  Those 48+
nutrients are present in the exact proportion, and in the exact amount,
necessary to digest exactly the amount of carbohydrate in that grain
of wheat. Nature is pretty tidy that way.
If we eat the grain of wheat as it is we get everything needed to
metabolize exactly that much starch.  If we allow the food processors
to remove the 48+ nutrients first, then, when we eat the refined
product, our bodies must take those 48+ nutrients from storage in
order to run the ""Krebs Cycle"".  So long as a certain % of refined
foods is not exceeded the human has reserves enough to get along.  The
best estimate by those who have taken the time to understand the field
(so far as we do understand it) is that we can tolerate about 15% of
our carbohydrates refined.  Above 15%, even with our presently
available crude measuring techniques, measurable decreases in function
occur.  The present average in this country is 60% refined &
increasing every year.  We have but to look at comparable statistics
from Guam (which has persistantly led our % here in the US by about 5
years--presently 65%+) to see what we can expect of our future chronic
disease incidence.
The problem is not a lack of research data but the unwillingness to
accept things that hit so close home as our own eating habits--one of
the most personal of things.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

Some topic suggestions:
I have a mild comes-and-goes psorisis.  I use a cortisone cream, but
find that it is much better in the summer (lying in the sun) than
the winter.  Causes? Cures?  Infectious?  Long-term dangers?
On a completely different topic,
My brother is an oncologist.  He mentioned that he heard from another
doctor at a party that autopsies of Alzheimer's disease patients showed
increased levels of aluminum in their brain tissue.  ""And what do
doctors recommend for their oldsters?  Maalox, of course.""
Feel free to take it from there.
(My brother was one of the generation that received X-ray treatment
for their tonsils.  He went through med school on an Air-Force
scholarship where he promised to serve after school.  At his pre-induction
physical, he was asked ""Doctor, why do you have a 15% hearing loss on
one side?""  Turned out to be a brain tumor, which was operated on
successfully.  He had a thyroidectomy subsequently.  (This was over 15
years ago.)  This gave him a unique perspective on oncology, of course.
I haven't heard too much about the effects of these treatments, though
I know three people who had them, all of whom have some ill effects.
Most of the net readers grew up after the X-ray treatment era, but
a summary/followup might be interesting.
When do you have time to study?
Ps: all of the above may be quoted/reproduced.

--The science of looking at a person's eyes (at the blood vessels and

  iridology?)
--Somebody told me that there is a current study in which they asked
  women who are having their IUD's removed if they could sample the

  scarring of the fallopian tubes, making pregnancy risky for them.

Hi. Since you are looking for topics, I am interested in
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  I was wondering if any

of years?   Or any information at all. Thanks.
#####################
I'm not sure about topics, but there were two spot radio announcements
by Carlton Fredricks, PhD, that I remember.  Fredricks is a nutritionist
(whatever that means).  He has several books published about nutritional
deficiencies and/or approaches for treatment/relief of certain conditions.
He was sponsored by Lindberg Nutrition which is a chain of Health Food 
stores in LA.
1.  Fredricks claimed that the symptoms of arthritis could be eliminated
or substantially reduced by complete elimination of the foods of the
nightshade family from the diet.  There were 5 items mentioned.  Three of
them were potatoes, tomatoes, and rutabaga.  I don't remember the other two.
Potatoes and tomatoes might take a little doing to eliminate (spaghetti,
lasagna, pizza, etc.) but it seemed to me that someone in the grip of
arthritis would regard that as a small price to pay for substantial relief.
The other two items were even less common than rutabaga.
2.  Fredricks related the story that if a farmer had a cow that couldn't
conceive and called the vet, the first thing the vet would ask is ""What's
the animal been eating?""  But if a woman goes to her doctor to complain about
infertility, the *last* thing the doctor asks is ""what have you been eating?""
(This story obviously doesn't prove anything, but somehow seems to strike
a responsive chord in me).

No.  Iridology is the study of the iris of the eye.  The study of the white
area of the eye is called sclarology (sp).  The detail of information available
in the whites is very coarse whereas the iris shows great detail.  The current
expert on iridology is Dr. Bernard Jensen.  Dr. Jensen has produced some books
that range from simple-to-read pamphletes to major works.
I have a pamphlete on sclarology at home.  If you are interested I can try and
search it out and give you the name and publisher and/or some basic
information.  If you would like to discuss iridology I would be happy to do so
or point you to a good source.

Chiropractors also represent a source of unnecessary x-rays.  Many
chiropractors do full spine xrays (some even full body xrays)
purporting to show the patient the areas of ""subluxation"".  Of
course the patient is too ignorant of radiology to question what
the chiropractor points out as areas of abnormality.  X ray
machines really don't belong in chiropractor's offices.  Very
few M.D.s have x-ray machines in the office due to the necessity
to have good calibration to avoid excess exposure.  (Dental x-rays
are an exception, but they aren't nearly as dangerous if miscalibration
does occur.)  I would advise people not to let a chiropractor x-ray them.","-06732tVrtEJ",11,1985-08-17,-4,0

I remember them well.  I also enjoyed looking at the bones in my feet.
While I haven't developed food cancer I've often wondered if there was
any relationship between them and my lifelong battle with athlete's
foot fungi.   Does somebody know if, in fact, there is some kind of
correlation between exposure to those devices and cancer of the bones
in the foot?

What I liked even better were the little radiation viewing devices you
sometimes found in cereal or crackerjack boxes. They were little
plastic tubes with a lens at one end and some of the radium material
that goes on watch dials at the other. You could look into it in a
dark room and watch the little flashes ...
This was back around the early '50s, I guess, when anything nuclear was
popular. It seemed like everyone was heading west to hunt for uranium;
movies like ""The Atomic Kid"" with Mickey Rooney were popular; and I
had a brand-new fake plastic Geiger counter I'd play with (it came
with fake uranium rocks and you'd hold the counter up to the rocks and
the counter would click like crazy). I can't remember ANYONE
suggesting that radiation might be bad for you in those days. The
movie ""Atomic Cafe"" captures the spirit of the times well.

Boy do I remember!  I have thought about it for years!
I'm 38 now and remember going to the store in the 50's and looking
at my feet through it until my parents would wisely drag me away.
I always figure that it's just a matter of time before
I have some wierd growth on one of my toes!  It does worry me
somewhat - I wonder if there are any statistics out there on
cancer of the foot associated with those things.

I was x-rayed by a chiropractor once.  He wanted a picture of the joint
where my spine meets my skull so he asked me to open my mouth wide and
he took the picture through my open jaws.  No headrest or anything to
hold my head in position.  He didn't get the joint.
Interestingly enough, he didn't wear any protective clothing or get
behind a screen or anything.

Let's not let our prejudism show, I would advise people not to let anyone x-ray
them without good reason.  Many of the clinics that doctors practice in do have
x-ray machines and the best way to pay them off is to x-ray people.  My
siister-in-law is currently attending a chiropractic college and has already
(in her first year) been informed of the dangers and importance of x-rays in
her future field.  Chiropractors are trained specialists, and just like doctors
and dentists, some are good and some are bad.  The only answer is intellegent
patients who have taken time to learn enough to tell the difference.
Uninformed people are one of the major risks in chiropractics, when asked about
their medical past many will take the ""If he's so good let him find out about
my past and tell me!"" attitude, this has led to many injuries because the
chiropractor didn't know about a past problem and did a manouver they would not
have done otherwise.  If you want advice about any form of natural treatment
don't ask a conventional doctor.

	My response was ""Well, you can't rule it our, but it's not something
I worry about.""  Perhaps the following can be much more reassuring:
	A mosquito is not so much like a hypodermic syringe injection as it is
like a needle-stick.  In the last four years, over 500 nurses, doctors, and
med students have accidentally stuck themselves with needles while drawing
blood from patient's with AIDS.  All are being followed by the CDC.  Not one
of them has even turned Antibody-positive (which neccessarily precedes the
disease, but which is not necessarily an obligate precursor of it.)
	I hope the above, which translates to ""It ain't happened yet"" is
more reassuring than my first article.

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

by semen has been only circumstantial, although fairly strong (its spread by
sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

I frequently use and recommend herbal remedies for almost any ailment.
The use of herbal laxitives to reduce weight is of course questionable.
It is also true that most people are constipated and are unaware of the
importance of bowel management (most doctors included).  Weight is
often a symptom of other problems and a return to a natural diet would
probably bring most people back to their proper weight.  Leading a
non-sedate lifestyle is also important (I question regimented exercise
with the exception of rebounding).  There is also food mixing, proper
mastication and frequency/timing to consider when eating.
The point is that herbal remedies used properly are of tremendous value
in helping people.  However, companies like Herbalife seem to be fast
buck companies with questionable scruples.  There are some excellent
herb companies with high standards and these should be praised in order
to remind people that segmenting out one group does not ruin the whole
bunch (we have all admitted their are bad doctors).  Herbal methods
have been very succesful in weight loss for those who spent the time to
learn and decided that their life was worth more than getting another
soda.  My family gets herbs from the Nature's Sunshine company and we
have been very pleased.
As a point of history Herbalife was started by a man who claims that
his mother died as a result of malnutrition while taking the Cambridge
Diet.  His qualifications to produce herbs is questionable and their
constant drive to ""Lose weight Now ask me how"" indicates that weight
loss is of more importance than health, not a very wholistic viewpoint.
Don't use Herbalife as an example unless you state that they are a bad
example.  None of their distributers has ever explained to me how they
can put a herb in tablet form without corrupting it.

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	I have my own small addition, I tested positive for ""hepatitis""
last summer, but negative for A/B.  I eventually discovered I had
mononucleosis.  Thus non-A/B hepatitis can also be a secondary symptom
of some other disease.

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual
partner if you had a positive HTLV-III test. A positive antibody test does
*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.","FhgStjPmxOgJ",19,1986-03-21,-10,11

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,
there is no way currently to get rid of the damn thing.","H75UzjNUdRYJ",19,1986-03-21,-9,26

success rate was less than spectacular).  We'd meet, dance, go home and screw,
etc.  If I slept with the same guy more than once within a short time span, then
I'd feel justified in at least entertaining thoughts of romance (not that I was
ever into these whirlwind affairs that seem so common).  I also wouldn't chase
after someone who was clearly just sleeping around, since my assumption would be
that he's just interested in sex and not in romance.  (Nothing wrong with that,
just not what I wanted.)
Now, however, the tables are turned, the rules have changed (at least mine have,
for a variety of reasons), and I'm following a more traditional (dare I say 
heterosexual) approach to dating.  Unfortunately, I never bothered to learn how
to date back when I was in school.
First, I wonder how gay men react to dating someone who is also dating others. 
Currently, I'm a little reluctant to give totally honest excuses such as ""I
can't go with you Friday because I already have another date"".  I guess I'm not
quite used to the idea of ""dating many, sleeping with none"", and I'm afraid that
my friends will share this confusion and turn it into distrust or dismissal.
Second, how does one turn a platonic friendship into a romantic relationship?
Or perhaps a better question is how long should it take?  I'm so used to 
sex first that part of me is very impatient, while the more rational parts of me
are torn between the risks of moving too quickly and the risks of moving too 
slowly. 
I apologize for making this so personal, but it seemed the best way to provide
context.  I hope this will turn into a general discussion of dating and changing
social practices of gay men, and not into a session of amateur psychoanalysis.

-------------------------DISCLAIMER: ""gay"" vs ""Gay""--------------------------
I admit much of this may seem based on traditional het styles.  I did not
set out to mimic.  I am not ashamed to be ""straight"" in some ways.  It's
a topic for another note, but the Gay fad for being snooty about all that
is heterosexually traditional bugs the h*ll out of me.  Being ""Gay"" is a
style as being ""straight acting"" is a style.  Being gay sexually doesn't
mean I have to be Gay in my choice of food, entertainment, cars, sports,
or political opinions.  Or my style of dating.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With all this ado said and done, comments are invited.  I hope having a
solid model to work from is useful.
 
I've answered one of the original question but failed to shed light on how one
starts dating a friend.  Except that it is perhaps a natural process of seeing
someone regularly; it also requires being un-male-like honest about growing
feelings.

dated men (until I met my mate) and feel it is the best and most logical way
to proceed in a relationship that might take a romantic direction. I really
never got a bad reaction from anybody, but I think Sacramento is more oriented
to that type of thing than larger, more highly populated areas (I just moved
to Pittsburgh; I'm not from here).
In answer to the first question, I don't think anybody should have to apologise
if they wish to date. For that matter, why should anybody apologise for how he
(or she) runs his social life as long as he doesn't hurt anybody else? 
Especially if the constraints are upon oneself. I found a lot of people used to
make me feel guilty about not going to bed with them. Then I realised, what the
hell should I feel guilty about that for? They don't need me for that, and I
have no obligation to them in that regard. So I did what I thought was right,
and if they didn't like it, tough. That was their problem, not mine. But those
who were truely my friends remained so. And it's only silly if you choose it
to be so.
As far as when an intimate relationship should begin, I would say it depends
upon the two individuals involved, and what your goals are. There is
nothing wrong with discussing the issue; it can save a whole lot of confusion.
Discuss your feelings, how you feel about each other. Nothing is 100% certain,
after all. When you both feel the time is really right (based on more than
horneyness) then it undoubtedly will be.
I'm glad this was brought up. For a while, I thought I was the only one who
thought dating was a good idea. I used to hear all this junk about how only
heterosexuals date and we can't/shouldn't do what they do. I think that's
bull. Besides, the attitude that ""just because they do it, it's wrong"" doesn't
hold water. It's like them saying something similar about us. I'm curious

What about a simple, ""Sorry, I have plans for Friday, how about Saturday?""
Or even ""Sorry, I am getting together with a friend Friday, how about
Saturday?"" [BTW, I thinks it's crucially important to offer an alternative
lest the other person think you are indirectly saying ""no"".] The other person
may conclude that you MIGHT be dating someone else, but so what - you're not

I think the use of ""platonic friendship"" might mislead us from the issue.
Are we talking about becoming sexual with good friends, or are we talking
about when to first have sex with a new romantic interest?  I think you
meant the latter.
My advice is that you have to learn from experience what
is right for you. I know that for myself, there has to be a physical attraction
from the start as well as a non-physical interest in the person. If there is
insufficient non-physical interest, nothing will develop after we have sex,
and after the sex is no longer ""mysterious"" with him, my interest in seeing him
will decrease rapidly. If there is insufficient physical attraction, I will
quickly become disinterested in the sex, and the relationship with end unless
he is interesting enough non-physically to be a ""platonic"" friend.
The only point at which TIMING of the first sex is important is that there
is enough interaction beforehand that I get to know if/how he is
non-physically interesting to me. This is important because this interest
is necessary for me to sustain romantic feelings just in case the sex winds
up just so-so.
I know that since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, I have been more interested
in ""dating"" with the goal of ""settling down"" with someone. However, speaking
health-wise, sex in the context of a ""relationship"" is no safer than
""recreational"" sex unless the two of you have had sex with no one else in
the past five or so years.","kXT4-cARIZsJ",9,1986-01-09,6,17

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

Of course, the recommendation to avoid exchanging bodily fluids only
makes sense if either or both haven't been absolutely monogamous for the
past 5 or 6 years.  But even today's good boys and girls might not have
been in such a covetable position for that entire period--if one interprets
the recommendations strictly, even a single ""unsafe"" sexual experience since
1980 is enough to no longer feel 100% assured.
While I think it's great to be monogamous if that's OK with you two, it's
also pretty obvious that these recommendations are directed towards those
who haven't been practicing monogamy.  And that includes a lot more than
those whom you would call promiscuous.

       and  cold  war within the gay community""	by Marshall K. Kirk
       and ""Erastes Pill"", in ""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
       ""Amongst	ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank	and
       power  in the gay world,	and the	opposing sides are drawn in
       terms of	self-identification and	public appearance.  What is
       worse,  this  struggle for hierarchy will continue unless we
       abandon some of the dogmas of the gay establishment. ...
       ""The shared impressions and arguments  put  forth  here	are
       tentative,  our generalizations are riddled with	exceptions,
       and we imagine that some	of our speculations will be  proved
       incorrect.
       ""First, consider	two modes of self-perception. ...  Many	gay
       men  like  to  identify themselves either as 'straight gays'
       (R-types) or not	(Q-types).
       R-types view themselves
       ""Rs like	to think that they pass	as straights on	the street.
       They  value  highly their acceptance in general society,	and
       many are	careful	to  sustain  friendships  in  the  straight
       community.   Rs	are  proud  of	their manly appearance,	and
       typically rankle	over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
       gay  males.   They  may	be  receptive to, or even obsessive
       about,  social  conventions  and	 norms	based	on   gender
       distinction;  ...   completely  homosexual Rs may persist in
       describing themselves as	'bisexual.'
       ""The one	thread connecting the  childhoods  of  Rs  we  have
       interviewed  is	peer  acceptability.  By and large, Rs were
       kids who, for one reason	 or  another,  could  conform  with
       ease,  and  so did. ...	Young Rs, it seems, were only dimly
       aware of	 their	need  for  the	rewards	 of  acceptability,
       effortlessly   achieved.	   So  the  arrival  of	 adolescent
       sexuality sent a	stunning shock	through	 well-adjusted	Rs.
       ...   Many  boys	 ignored and disguised this discovery until
       they could come to terms	with it.  In the meantime,  teenage
       Rs  struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer
       image.  Even as they grew up to enjoy sex with other boys on
       the  sly, conformism in all other aspects of demeanor became
       the self-exacted	quid pro quo.
       Q-types view themselves
       ""... these gays often are not, and feel	that  they  do	not
       wish  to	 be, 'straight-acting and appearing.' The extreme Q
       is a homosexual on display.   (He  may  not  always  be	one
       display ... [e.g.] in the presence of family and	employers.)
       On the street, he may assume any	one of the  several  public
       personas	 most  familiar	 to the	straight world:	the pomaded
       and permed 'fem', the titanic leather  master,  the  clipped
       clone,  the  GQ	hyperboy, and others. ...  Qs are outwardly
       gayified; they have bought into strict outgroup	stereotypes
       which, whether screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
       constitute  a  burlesque	 of  gender  roles.   Qs  think	 of
       themselves  as visible gays, and	tend to	make such a profile
       central to their	ego structure. ...
       ""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,  and  Qs	are
       perhaps more likely than	Rs to be drawn toward the asylum of
       gay ghettos in urban centers. ...
       ""Whereas	Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and	 so
       did, many Qs felt that, for whatever reasons, they could	not
       conform during their youth, and so did not.   Those  reasons
       might  include passivity, effeminacy, homeliness, remarkable
       prettiness, lack	of athletic  skill,  or	 almost	 any  other
       cause   for   unpopularity  among  male	youth.	 At  first,
       evidently, many Qs were unhappy loners  who  salvaged  their
       self-esteem by making a lodestar	virtue out of individualism
       rather than peer	acceptance.  But  non-conformity  engenders
       anti-conformism.	  So  some  Qs	went further and acquired a
       taste for  outrageousness,  actively  calculating  shock	 to
       others  in  order to reinforce their social status as rebels
       with a cause. ...
       ""As the years go	by, and	they learn that	they are not alone,
       Qs  adopt zealously the visible uniforms	and credos of their
       supporting outgroups. ...  Surveys have shown that, for many
       Qs,  camp  behavior  is	a  passing phase of overt defiance,
       toned down in later years.
       ""When those gays	who boast R-status meet	 those	who  defend
       Q-status, there can be trouble.	First, let's look at things
       for the viewpoint of the	 R.   For  one	thing,	the  sexual
       objects	of  Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs, for the most part
       are scorned. ...	 It is the 'fem' [from among the variety of
       Q-type  personas]  who bears the	brunt of the invective from
       Rs. ...
       ""[Gay] bars are often regarded by  Rs  as  the  bastions	 of
       self-segregated	Qs - branded as	twinkie	bars, leather bars,
       etc. - and so may be viewed with	distaste. ...
       ""We should mention at this point	that those Rs who shun	the
       bars  find it more difficult to lead satisfactory sex lives.
       They have trouble meeting other Rs because,  unlike  visible
       Qs,  out	 in  the  straight  world most Rs have banished	any
       tell-tale signals of  homosexuality  from  their	 conformist
       uniforms	and are	wary of	mistaken self-exposures. ...
       ""To make	sexual matters still more difficult  for  many	Rs,
       they  face two more unique dilemmas. ...	 First,	... a Q	may
       be drawn	to,  and  satisfied  by,  a  relationship  with	 an
       acceptably  masculine  R.   But what of the classic R-type -
       the 'all-American boy' whose only felt  shortcoming  is	his
       sexual  preference?   For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual
       object possessing the one feature  he  feels  he	 lacks	and
       wishes  to  capture - may very well be the straight boy,	who
       is, by definition, unattainable.	...
       ""The second sexual dilemma faced	by Rs involves	the  ritual
       of  sex-play  itself.   For  at	least  some  Rs,  it seems,
       masculine role performance is the  most	thrilling  part	 of
       sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened in homosexual practices
       such as passive anal sex	or active fellatio. ...
       ""But even if the	 R  is	contentedly  'out'  to	family	and
       friends,	 and  self-exposure  is	 not an	issue, he may still
       dislike Qs for two related reasons.
       ""First, because the R has typically conformed with  ease	 to
       the  mainstream,	 the  exaggerated  outgroup  displays of Qs
       simply baffle him.  Why would any person	choose to draw such
       public ridicule and abuse, he wonders? ...  'I don't see	why
       they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
       [we  interviewed].   'It	 obviously looks phony and fools no
       one.' At	best, then, many Rs come to view Qs  the  way  that
       many  straights view homosexuals	en bloc, as somehow foolish
       and trivial, a nationality of sterile cuckoos. ...
       ""Second,	Qs do more than	baffle Rs - they also  irritate	 Rs
       terribly,  to  a	 degree	that more detached straights cannot
       understand.  Many Rs plainly resent  being  identified  with
       the  Qs,	and blame them for the weird profile of	homosexuals
       as a whole. ...
       ""Like most gay males, it	seems,	even  exotic  Qs  hear	the
       siren  call  of	the rutting R.	And so relations between Qs
       and Rs grow still more tense.
       ""It is our impression that, for both Rs and  Qs,	 archetypal
       Rs  the	'idols	of  the	 tribe.'  It is	the R whose natural
       masculine grace tops  the  overall  hierarchy  of  desirable
       traits	in  the	 fierce	 gay  competition  of  good  looks.
       Handsome	Rs often sense this pecking order, and feeds  their
       egos  while  hardening  their disdain for Qs, especially	the
       effeminate ones.	...
       ""Many Qs	may learn from necessity to refocus their libido on
       fellow Qs. ...
       ""For it is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after	the
       R  as  sexual object, they may also resent and reject him as
       social  companion!   There  are	several	 reasons  for  this
       rejections. 'Sour grapes' is an understandable reaction from
       those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
       have  defensively  fashioned  a	lifestyle  out	of peculiar
       individualism are bound to resent (and perhaps envy  just  a
       little)	those  gays  who can and do successfully conform to
       straight	standards. ...	There is more to  Q/R  estrangement
       than just these problems.
       ""For one	thing, if the handsome all-American straight boy is
       the  ultimate  sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-
       type homosexual must appear as a	ghostly	mock-up	of the real
       thing. ...
       ""Further, Rs are	 still	more  upsetting	 to  those  Qs	who
       believe	that  'butch'  behavior	is just	an unnatural put-on
       for gays. ...  Just as the anti-conformity of Qs	baffles	Rs,
       the ease	with which Rs conform to the mainstream	may be hard
       for Qs to understand. ...  Hence, Qs  may  misinterpret	the
       Rs' ingrained disinclination to gayified	behavior, and label
       it homophobia. ...
       ""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type  persona
       as the 'true' gay type, and hence feel like outsiders within
       their own outgroup. ...
       ""How do these tensions between Rs and Qs	affect	the  social
       structures,  political institutions, and	activist success of
       the gay community?  ...	 Those	who  could  not	 hide  have
       instead	turned	to make	their stand against oppression,	and
       Qs have risen to	political leadership and brotherhood in	the
       activist	 movement across America.  This	is to their credit.
       Extreme Qs, as a	group, may rate	below Rs on the	sociosexual
       hierarchy,  but they can	and do rank above them on the scale
       of political power in the gay world.
       ""In  the	 meantime,  reticent  Rs,  who	benefit	 from	the
       sacrifices  of  Qs and yet carp about their flamboyant image
       in the straight world, have been	able to	have it	both  ways:
       they  achieve  personal	acceptability in the right straight
       world of	today, while relishing the progress  toward  social
       flexibility  made on their behalf for tomorrow.	But because
       Rs do not choose	to play	the activist game in great numbers,
       they  lose their	ability, as a group, to	influence the rules
       of that game.
       ""Although the point is hard  to	prove  with  certainty,	 we
       suspect that it is mainly Qs who	organize the gay community,
       set its norms, and decide which of  its	collective  efforts
       are  PC	['politically  correct'].  PC initiatives are those
       which the gay leadership	and press deem to be good  for	the
       gay  community  as  a whole.  And the mobilization of the R-
       type subgroup, it turns out,  is	 definitely  not  PC  -	 at
       least, not in Boston.  Let us give you an example.
       ""Several	years ago, a handful of	 young	men  in	 that  city
       attempted   to  start  an  organization	which  would  bring
       together	self-perceived	Rs  for	 social	 activities.   They
       posted  two  short announcements	in college and local papers
       with the	 headline,  'STRAIGHT  GAYS.'  The  leaders  rather
       crudely	hinted	that this new club would be for	those young
       gays 'not  entirely  comfortable	 with  the  glittering	bar
       crowd.'	One  of	 the  authors  attending the organization's
       first meeting.  He found	the room packed	 with  excited	and
       grateful	 Rs,  who immediately set about	the organization of
       the  club  activities  ranging  from  baseball	to   opera-
       listening.   The	only qualification for membership was self-
       selection according  to	the  understood	 character  of	the
       organization,  and  its	aims  remained	social	rather than
       political. ...  Within weeks, the club was regularly drawing
       to its meetings between one and two hundred members - making
       it one of the most active gay groups  in	 Boston.  ...	Its
       leaders likened the group to the	gay clubs designed to bring
       together	men with  other	 special  interests,  such  as	the
       black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite, or 'man/boy love'
       societies in town.
       ""Boston's  gay  leadership  did	not  buy  the	comparison,
       however.	  There	was evident suspicion and resentment (based
       some part, no doubt, on envy) at	the prospect  of  'student-
       aged'   all-American   Rs   cloistering	 exclusively  among
       themselves for social and sexual	companionship.	A local	gay
       newspaper  attacked  the	group openly for its supposed macho
       snobbery	and for	the 'closet cases' it  seemed  to  nurture.
       ...    The   organization's  leaders  protested	that  their
       intentions had been misunderstood  (although,  in  a  sense,
       they   have  been  all-to-clearly  understood  -	 and  found
       politically incorrect).	But eventually they  bowed  to	the
       pressure.   Over	 two  years  they  gradually phased out	the
       stress upon 'straight gays.'  The  criticism  from  the	gay
       community  stopped  coming.  Alas, so did the group's R-type
       members.	 Having	lost  its  distinctive	drawing	 card,	the
       entire  operation  fizzled.   It	 had  failed the test of PC
       administered by the Q-oriented community. ...
       ""And there is a final twist in the Q/R cold  war	 which	may
       impede  the  growth of gay rights from time to time.  R-type
       gays are	the ones who actually succeed in slipping into	the
       circles	of mainstream political	power in America.  So it is
       a sad irony that	confidential liaisons between uptight Rs in
       government  and	Qs heading the gay activist movement can be
       further	strained  by  the   R's	  basic	  alienation   form
       unconventional Qs in general. ...
       ""This  analysis	has  found  the	 gay  world  troubled	and
       handicapped by the mutual alienation of Qs and Rs.  It is PC
       to deny this split. ...	First, we must abandon PC myths	and
       admit  that  the	 split	exists.	 Second, we must understand
       clearly the root	cause of the Q/R cold  war.   Someone  once
       called  it  'oppression	sickness':  each outgroup member is
       ill-at-ease with	himself, and is	frustrated  by	his  forced
       companions,  because the	social mainstream imposes pressures
       and expectations	which he feels that  he	 cannot	 meet,	and
       because	his  companions	 remind	him of his own failure.	 So
       the more	progress we can	make toward  social  acceptance	 in
       the  straight world for gays as a whole,	the less tension we
       will see	between	groups within the gay world. ...
       ""In the meantime, the gay  community  should  recognize	the
       distinct	identity and special problems of R-type	homosexuals
       - and could begin by expanding the aegis	of PC tolerance	 to
       include R-type organizations.

two polar categories of gay men, based on how they were able to
conform in youth and how they accepted ""gayified"" behavior in adulthood.
Things don't seem that clear cut to me for several reasons:
The first reason is that I wouldn't know whether to classify myself as
a Q or R. On one hand, much of ""gayified"" behavior and style really
turns me off. Just as the authors say of R's, my reaction OFTEN
is ""Why would someone want to appear that way?"" On the other hand,
I don't shun the gay ghetto and, like Q's, I suspect that a gay man
who does so suffers from internalized homophobia. In my childhood,
I was an unathletic sissy. I could not conform, but unlike the author's
description of Q youths, I did not turn non-conformity into anti-conformity.
Instead I deeply wished I could conform.
The second reason is that I often meet ""gayified"" gay men who DID
conform in their youth. They were athletic, they joined a fraternity,
etc. And now as adults they conform within the gay ghetto. Because of
their conformity to some ""gayified"" style, if I had to classify them
as Q's or R's, I would chose Q's. They OFTEN aren't particularly
effeminate, but rather ""masculine"" clone types, who are on one of the
gay bar's softball teams in the gay softball league, who go out
to gay discos on the weekend (at least prior to the epidemic), and in
general, seem to keep their social life restricted pretty much to the
gay ghetto.
The third reason has to do with gay self-hatred. The authors say that R's
put a premium on straight appearance because they were
able to conform and reap the benefits of conformity during their youth.
The authors explain the R's dislike of gayified behavior as
inability to appreciate why Q's lean towards anti-conformity.
The authors claim that the Q's view this dislike as gay self-hatred,
and that the Q's are merely un-understanding of the R's premium on
conformity. I strongly disagree. There is quite a bit of ""R-like""
behavior that IS motivated by homophobia, although it would be
difficult to ascertain how much of this dislike of various
""gayified"" behavior comes from homophobia.
But on the other hand, a lot of what the authors say rings true.
I think that this is so because what they describe are not two
types of gay PERSONS, but rather two DYNAMICS IN OUR PERSONALITIES.
I see both the ""R"" dynamic and the ""Q"" dynamic at work in my own
personality, in my own style, and in the personalities and styles
of my gay male friends. Furthermore, most gay men I meet show quite
a mixture of these two dynamics. As for the way I ""categorize"" (or not)
myself, I do not think of myself as a gayified gay or as a ""straight""
gay, but as a Rob-Bernardo-gay (or as a just plain Rob-Bernardo). I often
feel very critical of gay men who have moved to San Francisco and
gotten too GHETTOIZED. They seem to have lost their individuality
in conforming to the gay ghetto. But that's another posting to net.motss.
So, what I think the authors missed is that conformity in youth
can lead to conformity to the gay ghetto in adulthood, and that
some dislike for gayified behavior is due to homophobia.","GilhGtHFa8wJ",23,1985-11-23,-11,10

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

I would be interested in a proof on how gay sexual behaviour is self-
destructive. I engage in it with my lover, and I have found that it is
constructive; the physical act is only one aspect of it. I guess I don't
believe in sex, only making love. A bonding occurs (or should, in my
opinion) when such an act is performed. I'm afraid that Mr. Ardnt is the
one who seems to lack understanding of what the act is all about.
He also evidences a lack of understanding in what exactly occurs in
homosexual acts.

I'd be interested in a proof demonstrating that it is a perversion. Such 
behaviour occurs elsewhere in nature (it's been observed in marine mammals
and avian species among other). And who is he to say what sexual fulfilment
(or fulfullment, as he says)is anyway? What may be fulfilling for him may not
be for others. I'm afraid Mr. Ardnt lack the quality of empathy.

Again, can he prove his assertion? Anal intercourse is not the only way to
communicate the disease, and it may not be the only factor. The condition
of the immune system at the time the virus is introduced to the body may
be a factor as well.
Mr. Ardnt makes many assertions, but I think the proof for the, if it exists,
is flimsy at best. It is nice to see something written by him which is
halfway decent though. That's nice.","g9t8pGWN0fIJ",2,1985-11-16,11,21

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

within	the  gay  community""  by  Marshall  K.	Kirk and ""Erastes Pill"", in
""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
""Amongst ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank and power  in	the
gay world, and the opposing sides are drawn in terms of	self-identification
and public appearance.	What is	worse, this  struggle  for  hierarchy  will
continue unless	we abandon some	of the dogmas of the gay establishment.	...
""The shared impressions	and arguments put forth	 here  are  tentative,	our
generalizations	 are  riddled  with exceptions,	and we imagine that some of
our speculations will be proved	incorrect.
""First,	consider two modes of self-perception. ...  Many gay  men  like	 to
identify themselves either as 'straight	gays' (R-types)	or not (Q-types).
_ R_ -_ t_ y_ p_ e_ s__ v_ i_ e_ w__ t_ h_ e_ m_ s_ e_ l_ v_ e_ s
""Rs like to think that they pass as straights on  the  street.	They  value
highly their acceptance	in general society, and	many are careful to sustain
friendships in the  straight  community.   Rs  are  proud  of  their  manly
appearance, and	typically rankle over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
gay males.  They may be	receptive  to,	or  even  obsessive  about,  social
conventions   and  norms  based	 on  gender  distinction;  ...	 completely
homosexual Rs may persist in describing	themselves as 'bisexual.'
""The one thread	connecting the childhoods of Rs	we have	interviewed is _ p_ e_ e_ r
_ a_ c_ c_ e_ p_ t_ a_ b_ i_ l_ i_ t_ y.	 By and	large, Rs were kids who, for one reason	or another,
_ c_ o_ u_ l_ d conform with ease, and so	did. ...  Young	Rs,  it	 seems,	 were  only
dimly  aware  of  their	need for the rewards of	acceptability, effortlessly
achieved.  So the arrival of adolescent	sexuality  sent	 a  stunning  shock
through	 well-adjusted	Rs.  ...   Many	 boys  ignored	and  disguised this
discovery until	they could come	to terms with it.  In the meantime, teenage
Rs struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer image.  Even as
they grew up to	enjoy sex with other boys on the  sly,	conformism  in	all
other aspects of demeanor became the self-exacted _ q_ u_ i_ d _ p_ r_ o _ q_ u_ o.
_ Q_ -_ t_ y_ p_ e_ s__ v_ i_ e_ w__ t_ h_ e_ m_ s_ e_ l_ v_ e_ s
""... these gays	often are not, and feel	 that  they  do	 not  wish  to	be,
'straight-acting  and appearing.' The extreme Q	is a homosexual	on display.
(He may	not always be one display ... [e.g.] in	the presence of	family	and
employers.)  On	 the  street,  he  may assume any one of the several public
personas most familiar to the straight world: the pomaded and permed 'fem',
the titanic leather master, the	clipped	clone, the _ G_ Q hyperboy,	and others.
...  Qs	are outwardly _ g_ a_ y_ i_ f_ i_ e_ d;	 they  have  bought  into  strict  outgroup
stereotypes  which,  whether  screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
constitute a burlesque of gender roles.	 Qs think of themselves	as  visible
gays, and tend to make such a profile central to their ego structure. ...
""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,	and  Qs	 are  perhaps  more
likely	than  Rs  to  be  drawn	 toward	 the asylum of gay ghettos in urban
centers. ...
""Whereas Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and so  did,  many	 Qs
felt that, for whatever	reasons, they could not	conform	during their youth,
and so	did  not.   Those  reasons  might  include  passivity,	effeminacy,
homeliness,  remarkable	 prettiness,  lack of athletic skill, or almost	any
other cause for	unpopularity among male	youth.	At first,  evidently,  many
Qs  were unhappy loners	who salvaged their self-esteem by making a lodestar
virtue	out  of	 _ i_ n_ d_ i_ v_ i_ d_ u_ a_ l_ i_ s_ m	rather	than  peer  acceptance.	  But  non-
conformity engenders anti-conformism.  So some Qs went further and acquired
a taste	for outrageousness, actively calculating shock to others  in  order
to reinforce their social status as rebels with	a cause. ...
""As the	years go by, and they learn that  they	are  not  alone,  Qs  adopt
zealously  the	visible	 uniforms and credos of	their supporting outgroups.
...  Surveys have shown	that, for many Qs, camp	behavior is a passing phase
of overt defiance, toned down in later years.
""When those gays who boast R-status meet those who defend  Q-status,  there
can  be	 trouble.   First, let's look at things	for the	viewpoint of the R.
For one	thing, the sexual objects of Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs,  for	the
most  part  are	scorned. ...  It is the	'fem' [from among the variety of Q-
type personas] who bears the brunt of the invective from Rs. ...
""[Gay] bars are	often regarded by Rs as	the bastions of	self-segregated	 Qs
-  branded  as twinkie bars, leather bars, etc.	- and so may be	viewed with
distaste. ...
""We should mention at this point that those Rs who shun	the  bars  find	 it
more  difficult	 to lead satisfactory sex lives.  They have trouble meeting
other Rs because, unlike visible Qs, out in the	straight world most Rs have
banished  any  tell-tale  signals  of  homosexuality  from their conformist
uniforms and are wary of mistaken self-exposures. ...
""To make sexual	matters	still more difficult for many  Rs,  they  face	two
more  unique  dilemmas.	 ...  First, ... a Q may be drawn to, and satisfied
by, a relationship with	an acceptably masculine	R.  But	what of	the classic
R-type	-  the 'all-American boy' whose	only felt shortcoming is his sexual
preference?  For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual object  possessing	the
one  feature he	feels he lacks and wishes to capture - may very	well be	the
straight boy, who is, by definition, unattainable. ...
""The second sexual dilemma faced by Rs	involves  the  ritual  of  sex-play
itself.	  For at least some Rs,	it seems, masculine _ r_ o_ l_ e _ p_ e_ r_ f_ o_ r_ m_ a_ n_ c_ e is	the
most thrilling part of sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened  in	 homosexual
practices such as passive anal sex or active fellatio. ...
""But even if the R is contentedly 'out'	to family and  friends,	 and  self-
exposure is not	an issue, he may still dislike Qs for two related reasons.
""First,	because	the R has typically conformed with ease	to the	mainstream,
the  exaggerated  outgroup displays of Qs simply _ b_ a_ f_ f_ l_ e	him.  Why would	any
person _ c_ h_ o_ o_ s_ e to draw such public ridicule and abuse, he wonders?  ...	 'I
don't  see why they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
[we interviewed].  'It obviously looks phony and fools no  one.'  At  best,
then,  many Rs come to view Qs the way that many straights view	homosexuals
_ e_ n _ b_ l_ o_ c, as somehow foolish and	trivial, a nationality of sterile  cuckoos.
...
""Second, Qs do more than baffle	Rs - they also _ i_ r_ r_ i_ t_ a_ t_ e	Rs terribly,  to  a
degree	that  more  detached  straights	cannot understand.  Many Rs plainly
resent being identified	with the Qs, and blame them for	the  weird  profile
of homosexuals as a whole. ...
""Like most gay males, it seems,	even exotic Qs hear the	siren call  of	the
rutting	R.  And	so relations between Qs	and Rs grow still more tense.
""It is our impression that, for	_ b_ o_ t_ h Rs	and Qs,	archetypal Rs the 'idols of
the  tribe.'  It  is  the  R whose natural masculine grace tops	the overall
hierarchy of desirable traits in the fierce gay	competition of good  looks.
Handsome  Rs  often  sense  this  pecking order, and feeds their egos while
hardening their	disdain	for Qs,	especially the effeminate ones.	...
""Many Qs may learn from	necessity to refocus their libido on fellow Qs.	...
""For it	is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after the  R	 as  sexual
object,	they may also resent and reject	him as social companion!  There	are
several	reasons	for this rejections. 'Sour  grapes'  is	 an  understandable
reaction  from those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
have defensively fashioned a lifestyle out of  peculiar	 individualism	are
bound  to resent (and perhaps envy just	a little) those	gays who can and do
successfully conform to	straight standards.  ...   There  is  more  to	Q/R
estrangement than just these problems.
""For one thing,	if the handsome	all-American straight boy is  the  ultimate
sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-type homosexual must appear as
a ghostly mock-up of the real thing. ...
""Further, Rs are still more upsetting to those Qs who believe that  'butch'
behavior  is  just  an	unnatural  put-on  for gays. ...  Just as the anti-
conformity of Qs baffles  Rs,  the  ease  with	which  Rs  conform  to	the
mainstream   may  be  hard  for	 Qs  to	 understand.  ...   Hence,  Qs	may
misinterpret the Rs' ingrained disinclination  to  gayified  behavior,	and
label it homophobia. ...
""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type persona as	the  'true'
gay type, and hence feel like outsiders	within their own outgroup. ...
""How do	these tensions between Rs and  Qs  affect  the	social	structures,
political  institutions,  and  activist	 success  of the gay community?	...
Those who could	not hide have instead turned to	make  their  stand  against
oppression,  and  Qs  have risen to political leadership and brotherhood in
the activist movement across America.  This is to  their  credit.   Extreme
Qs,  as	 a  group, may rate below Rs on	the sociosexual	hierarchy, but they
can and	do rank	above them on the scale	 of  _ p_ o_ l_ i_ t_ i_ c_ a_ l	power  in  the	gay
world.
""In the	meantime, reticent Rs, who benefit from	the sacrifices	of  Qs	and
yet carp about their flamboyant	image in the straight world, have been able
to have	it both	ways: they achieve  personal  acceptability  in	 the  right
straight  world	 of  today,  while  relishing  the  progress  toward social
flexibility made on their behalf for  tomorrow.	  But  because	Rs  do	not
choose to play the activist game in great numbers, they	lose their ability,
as a group, to influence the rules of that game.
""Although the point is hard to prove with certainty, we	suspect	that it	 is
mainly	Qs  who	organize the gay community, set	its norms, and decide which
of its collective efforts are PC ['politically correct'].   PC	initiatives
are  those  which  the gay leadership and press	deem to	be good	for the	gay
community as a whole.  And the mobilization  of	 the  R-type  subgroup,	 it
turns out, is definitely _ n_ o_ t PC	- at least, not	in Boston.  Let	us give	you
an example.
""Several years ago, a handful of young men in that city	attempted to  start
an  organization  which	 would	bring together self-perceived Rs for social
activities.  They posted two  short  announcements  in	college	 and  local
papers	with  the  headline,  'STRAIGHT	 GAYS.'	 The leaders rather crudely
hinted that this new club would	be  for	 those	young  gays  'not  entirely
comfortable  with  the	glittering bar crowd.' One of the authors attending
the organization's first meeting.  He found the	room  packed  with  excited
and  grateful  Rs,  who	 immediately set about the organization	of the club
activities  ranging   from   baseball	to   opera-listening.	 The   only
qualification for membership was self-selection	according to the understood
character of the organization, and its aims  remained  social  rather  than
political.  ...	  Within  weeks,  the  club  was  regularly  drawing to	its
meetings between one and two hundred members - making it one  of  the  most
active	gay groups in Boston. ...  Its leaders likened the group to the	gay
clubs designed to bring	together men with other	special	interests, such	 as
the  black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite,	or 'man/boy love' societies
in town.
""Boston's gay leadership did not buy the comparison,  however.	 There	was
evident	 suspicion  and	 resentment (based some	part, no doubt,	on envy) at
the prospect of	 'student-aged'	 all-American  Rs  cloistering	exclusively
among  themselves  for	social	and  sexual  companionship.   A	 local	gay
newspaper attacked the group openly for	its supposed macho snobbery and	for
the  'closet  cases'  it seemed	to nurture. ...	 The organization's leaders
protested that their intentions	had  been  misunderstood  (although,  in  a
sense,	they  have  been  all-to-clearly understood - and found	politically
incorrect).  But eventually they bowed to the  pressure.   Over	 two  years
they  gradually	 phased	 out the stress	upon 'straight gays.' The criticism
from the gay community stopped coming.	Alas, so  did  the  group's  R-type
members.   Having  lost	 its distinctive drawing card, the entire operation
fizzled.  It had failed	the test  of  PC  administered	by  the	 Q-oriented
community. ...
""And there is a	final twist in the Q/R cold war	which may impede the growth
of  gay	 rights	 from  time to time.  R-type gays are the ones who actually
succeed	in slipping into the  circles  of  mainstream  political  power	 in
America.   So  it is a sad irony that confidential liaisons between uptight
Rs in government and Qs	heading	the gay	activist movement  can	be  further
strained by the	R's basic alienation form unconventional Qs in general.	...
""This analysis has found the gay world	troubled  and  handicapped  by	the
mutual	alienation  of Qs and Rs.  It is PC to deny this split.	...  First,
we must	abandon	PC myths and admit that	the split exists.  Second, we  must
understand clearly the root cause of the Q/R cold war.	Someone	once called
it  'oppression	 sickness':   each  outgroup  member  is  ill-at-ease  with
himself,  and  is  frustrated  by his forced companions, because the social
mainstream imposes pressures and expectations which he feels that he cannot
meet,  and  because  his  companions remind him	of his own failure.  So	the
more progress we can make toward social	acceptance in  the  straight  world
for gays as a whole, the less tension we will see between groups _ w_ i_ t_ h_ i_ n	the
gay world. ...
""In the	meantime, the gay community should recognize the distinct  identity
and  special  problems of R-type homosexuals - and could begin by expanding
the aegis of PC	tolerance to include R-type organizations.
""At the	same time, the community must also burn	off the	chaff  of  its	own
implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""

     The current Christopher Street has an article addressing
America's increasing conservatism (I, for one, think the media is
unwittingly increasing conservatism by focusing on ""yuppies"" and
""increasing conservatism"", but you can insert your own theory on the
cliche at this point and read on).  The main thrust seems twofold:
diminish the emotional reaction accompanying words like ""gay"" and
""homosexual"", and re-interpret the gay cause as one for universal
American principles: freedom to beleive what you want, to say what you
want, to do what you want as long as it doesn't conflict with other's
rights (needless to say, that doesn't include the right to not deal
with gay issues).  Straights might not defend your right to have
children, but they'll defend to their deaths the right for you to talk
about it-- at least in theory.  (For the record, children of
homosexuals are probabilistically Less likely to turn out homosexual--
too bad stats don't have much impact on the way people make
decisions).
     I, for one, am very glad to see a conservative movement within
the gay subculture.  Ok, partly I'm biased because I beleive in
economic conservativism (generally laissez faire), but partly it's
because I'm tired of Sister Boomboom representing the gay cause to
America's families.  
     PCness (Political Correctness) has rendered the gay movement
impotent.  By calling Robert's Rules of Order heterosexual societal
baggage, it has created meetings decaying to complete disorder.  About
six years ago, a congressional report asked for suggested revisions to
American sex education to incorporate the lessons of the gay cause.
No response from the gay community was ever given, partly because
side issues had equal priority: cross-dressing is ok, isn't it?  Sex
between people widely divergent in age is ok, isn't it?  
     Before you (perhaps otherwise justly) accuse me of the same
intolerant attitudes towards diversity that Jerry Falwell and the KKK
have, let me say that I beleive goodness is in the eyes of the
beholder, and that only acts which are clearly destructive should be
prohibited.  But at the same time let me claim that the reason I
realize this is because I am forever rubbing up against the walls
society has arbitrarily placed against what I want to do.  And let me
further claim that, having grown up in a small midwestern town, had I
not rubbed up against those restrictions I would (perhaps) be as
intolerant as the rest.
     For although I recognize it is wrong to restrict others' freedom
in the name of making my own world more ""perfect"" (taken to extreme,
the mentality shouts ""less Catholics, Jews, Blacks, homosexuals to
estrange my children-- everyone should be just like me""), I also claim
that the gains to be made in the 1980's do not stem from convincing
others that this is true.  The media resents broadcasting messages
like this during the Reagon admistration (what kind of a message would
that be during a conservative ""era""?).  
     The Gay cause must set specific goals, achievable one at a time,
which satisfy two conditions: a) the goal must be acheivable in the
current political climate, and b) the goal must be supported by a
large number of individuals willin to contribute to the cause.  Yes,
this might mean we must temporarily halt our struggle against
pornography censors in order to get the feminist cause back on our
side.  It might mean we must abandon our struggle to lower the age of
consent in some states in order to get wider support for the abolition
of sodomy laws.  But it might also mean step by step victories which
will form the basis of a further movement towards maximum freedom.  
     In the end, we must stop estranging the most wealthy gays in the
country who, up till now, have been reticent to donate money to a
cause plagued with the reputation of being slightly left of cummunism.
It is time to free ourselves of our extremest stereotyping, to let
people know who we, as gays and lesbians, truly are-- rather like
everyone else.

'heterosexism'	I  mean	 an  unwitting	or  unconscious	 assumption on
someone's part that everyone  is  heterosexual	and  perhaps  leads  a
certain	type of	life, e.g.  marriage, family.)
The disenfranchisement	I  feel	 does  not  come  from	individuals  I
personally  deal  with,	 but  more  from  people at a distance or from
institutions.  For example, the	people at work who  I  talk  with  are
basically  not	heterosexist.	But the	words and actions of coworkers
who I do not interact with much, even professionally,  sometimes  make
me  feel  disenfranchised.   Just subtle things	in the way they	phrase
things sometimes.  Usually nothing so consciously anti-gay that, if  I
chose, I could challenge them about.
Nobody but me in our office openly gay that I  know  of.   No  one  to
REALLY	talk 'sisterly'	with.  There are a couple three	people at work
I can sort-of talk with	to in the way I	 would	only  normally	do  to
another	gay man, e.g. feeling comfortable enough to remark how nice it
is that	there are quite	a few construction workers around to  look  at
(the  building	is  half  unbuilt).   And  that	comfort	came only very
recently.
Sometimes I feel lonely.
AIDS
I don't	think there has	been a single day in the past year or so  that
I  have	 not thought about, worried about the threat of	AIDS.  The New
York Native (a NY-based	gay biweekly newspaper that is national	in its
scope of news) arrived today and a good	quarter	of its 60 odd pages is
about AIDS.
I will go to the gym tomorrow morning.	I will see  perhaps  a	little
bruise there or	a red mark here	and the	first thing that flashes in my
mind is	KS, even when I	KNOW that I ALWAYS get a little	 bruise	 there
from horseback riding, and that	I ALWAYS have had that little red mark
here ever since	I can remember.	 I will	effortlessly use the  exercise
cycle  for 20 minutes, but later in the	day when I return to my	office
from lunch and get a little winded going up three  flights  of	stairs
while  talking	at  the	same time, I wonder if it is pneumocystis.  On
Friday,	Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, will	come  out.   I
will  turn to the obituary column with morbid interest.	 There will be
half a dozen photos, mostly of gay men about my	age, some  of  whom  I
will recognize from the	neighborhood, from the gym, etc.  Infrequently
there will be someone I	knew  well,  a	person	I  once	 dated,	 or  a
roommate I once	shared an apartment with.
Do you think there's a chance Reagan will get AIDS from	the  blood  (I
presume) he got	during his polyp surgery?
Sometimes I feel terror.
HOME
I dream	of having a home life with another man on a gentleman's	 farm.
Something  small  but pretty.  A few animals - two horses, some	goats.
Something I think I could afford  with	another	 person	 of  the  same
means.
Another	gay man	who likes country living?  Another gay man  who	 likes
horses	(and  that's  not  just	 from  the  other  side	of the fence)?
Another	gay man	whose boots are	not just a part	of his	""cowboy	 drag""
when  he  goes out to the c/w bar on the weekend?  (And, god, he's got
to be intelligent, verbal, and introspective enough to get along  with
someone	 who  grew up in an upper middle class mainly Jewish suburb of
New York, who went to college for 10 years,  and  who  is  a  computer
programmer).
Sometimes I laugh!

I think this is a very common feeling among gay people, though how one
reacts to it depends on where it happens, how much you have learned to
artificially separate your personal life from your public persona, and how
sensitive you are to the kind of dissonance this produces.
It hasn't been a real problem for me where I work, except in one particular
instance which won't happen again: every year BBN holds a ""winter party"" at
a local museum with food, music and dancing, and last winter, the entire
company was invited.  Plans for my lover and I to meet up with other gay
and non-gay friends quickly vanished as I tried to find them among the
2000-odd people meandering around the six sprawling floors of the Science
Museum.  Lots of strangers, lots of people you wouldn't even want to talk
with even IF your lover weren't standing next to you, straight couples
EVERYWHERE, and my local support system nowhere to be found.  Aauuugggh.
After a few hours we left, suffocating from the thick cloud of
heterosexuality.  (I am sure I have just ""disenfranchised"" the straight
contingent here, but I'm telling it to you ""straight"", as it were.)

would be interested in the view point of a ""straight"" married female.  You
might be interested to know that we share some of the same views.  I have 
also been unhappy about the volume of postings to this net group.  What is
there tends to be of good content, but what struck me the most is I always
see the same names.  I am posting this via anonymous electronic mail for
two reasons.  I am new to the net and have just not learned how to post, and as
I am only working for the summer, it was not worth taking the time.  Also,
to be honest, I would hesitate to post to this news group because I would
not want anybody getting the wrong idea about me, even if I am married.  Of
course if anybody did, that would mean they also read this news group, right?
It will not be possible for me to receive any mail, as I am getting ready to
leave, but I probably still be reading the news group, so any public responses
(good or bad) are welcome.
	I am sure you wonder why I would be interested in your news group.
Some of you may think it is only a sordid curiosity.  I like to understand
what is happening around me.  The foreign friends I have had fascinate me
when they talk about their culture and beliefs.  In the same way your
culture fascinates me.  You live a life and emotions I do not understand, 
only because you are in a situation unlike any I have ever known.  The only 
close gay friends I have had were in high school, and still in the transition 
period where they had serious questions within themselves, so yours is a world 
completely unfamiliar to me.
	As for Ken Arndt, I know he attacks a very sensitive area with you,
but I really think it should not bother you.  In reading other news groups,
he is just as unpopular.  More than any other, he is openly insulted for his
view points.  Coming from anybody else, I can understand the agony it would
cause, but Ken is a sub-human life form with a pretense of human emotions.  I
was honestly surprised when he said he still loves you, and when are you going
to get together.  I would have been even more surprised if you had taken him
up on it, and would have assumed it was only to greet him in hostile numbers
with ulterior motives, but then that would be sinking to his level.
	One thing I would like to say, just as you might not like being
characterized as having a certain behaviour because you are gay, I too feel
slightly offended by the category you lump us in at times.  Remember, the
most hostile are probably also the most verbal.  Do you always have the best
of your group represent you?  On our campus the ""leader of the gays"" (self-
proclaimed, of course) was the local joke, and though I don't know this for
a fact, I suspect he only made things harder for some of the others.  It seemed
that every time he did not get what he wanted it was because he was discriminated
against for being gay.  This was believable the first time, but the fourth or
fifth time, the story got old.  Now, if I believed he truly represented all
gays on our campus, I would have come up with a pretty low opinion of them.
Instead, I chose to judge people on an individual basis.
	On the Jason on Bars article - I found it amusing.  It seemed to me
to be a cross between honesty and friendly humour.  It did not seem like the
article of a depressed resentful person taking his problems out on others.
I also learned something from it, as I have learned from all of the articles,
but I didn't take it as a verbatim narrative of a typical night at the bars.
It seemed the point was the emotions creating the actions, not a satire of
the gay whores.  The articles on the gay emotions have been much more interesting
than the rehashed stories on AIDS.  This is the only place I know that I can
find such honesty about the feelings and struggles of gay people.  Of course,
it would mean more if more people contributed.  I strongly encourage others
to take advantage of the anonymous postings.  It would also help if any body
who did chose some nick name, so multiple postings can be easily followed.
	Well, I know I have rambled on.  I hope this was taken in the positive
way it was intended.  If I have inadvertantly offended anybody, I apologize.
I am not aware of everything that is acceptable, ie - I didn't know 
homosexual was a derogatory term until reading this group, I always thought
the term gay was more insulting.

> You live a life and emotions I do not understand,

which got me thinking a bit about my everyday life, gay culture,
""gay emotions"", etc.  In a sense this is directed at the non-gay
readers of net.motss, though it's also an invitation for comments
from other gay people.
The issue of differences between gay and straight people is complicated and
multi-faceted, depending on the points you want to make and the method of
analysis you take.  I'm going to concentrate on what will seem almost
blatantly obvious and not worth mentioning to some, but subtlety often gets
lost in this discussion, so I'll forge ahead.  My thesis is, simply, that
there is no such thing as a ""gay emotion"" and that there are few
categorical emotional differences between straight or gay relationships.
This is no less true for committed couples, either cohabiting or married, a
form of relationship which is probably less affected by gay/straight
""cultural differences"" for the points I wish to make.  Right now I know a
*lot* of couples--my straight friends are all at that late 20's-early 30's
""marrying age"", and being in a long-term relationship myself, we've also
gained a lot of gay couples as friends.  I see the same joys, trials and
committment regardless of their sexual orientation.  You still have to take
out the garbage, still have to build a compatible living arrangement, still
can reflect on your partner sleeping next to you, still have to plan
together the life you both wish to live.  The emotions which bind a couple
together and which grow over time are identical in straight or gay
relationships.
I am not trying to dismiss the differences between straight and gay
relationships (which certainly are there: should make some interesting
followup discussion--hint, hint).  I *am* trying to emphasize the
commonality which comes, simply, from our shared humanity.

like to bring up movies. I posted a note last year asking if anyone knew of
the availability of a couple of gay films on videocasette; I'll ask again
since I was told that they are out there but the guy who told me didn't know
the source. I belong to a gay support group and we try to have a movie night
once a month or so. So far all that I've been able to supply the group with
is ""Partners"" with Ryan O'Neil ""HBO America Undercover"" special on gays in
America ""Word is Out"" Documentary by 24 gay men and women ""Aids The First
Chapter"" a PBS Nova production ""Boys in the Band"" ""La Cage Aux Folles"" There
just aren't many films that portray us in a positive light.
    The two films I would like to get my hands on are ""A Very Natural Thing""
which was released ~~1974. The promotional poster showed two men playing in
the surf and the caption read ""The story of David and Jason, It's the same
only different"" I thought that the movie was very well made; depicting a young
preist leaving the monestary and coming out in N.Y.C. The other movie is
""Saturday Night at the Baths"">> no not a porno but the story of a (supposedly)
straight couple. The woman was a singer or piano player at the Continental
Baths in New York. The movie builds up to the point where her boyfriend ends
up going to bed with one of their gay friends who works at ther baths and
where their relationship goes from there. Has anyone seen these two movies
and how did you feel about them....where can I get them if you know?
   There are also a series of foreign films that the Advocate advertises. The
one that comes to mind is ""You are Not Alone"" Anybody seen any of these and
are they worth purchasing. I'm looking for any *GOOD* documentaries that 
would go over well at a gay rap/support group meeting.

	Edmund White has written A BOY'S LIFE (1982?), which got a rave
review by Eliot Fremont-Smith in the NYTimes.  It's a thinly-disguised
autobiography of a gay adolescence, & is I think his best book: he drops
the pretence of trying to be the American Proust.  He also co-authored
THE JOY OF SEX, which for a sex handbook has some great writing.
	The only recent French gay novel I've read is Yves Navarre's
LES LOUKUMS (1972, published in US as SWEET TOOTH by RiverRun Press I
think), an acid satire of New York City using a metaphor of necrophilia;
however, it may make readers wince in these days of AIDS.  Navarre is
openly gay; try his many other novels.  Only a few have been translated
into English, as far as I know.

& street fair on Christopher Street took place under hot (80s) sunny
skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters
out there willing to post a detailed article?

what would YOU do when you found out a friend had AIDS?????  would you
hold their hand, hug them when they cried, feed them when they were too
weak to eat, hold them when they were delerious with fever and didn't
know you were there?  NO, DAMN YOU!!!!  You would be spouting your
GOD-DAMNED, SELF-RIGHTEOUS, POMPOUS BULLSHIT that was handed to you
by your ""god"" about how it was all brought on him by HIMSELF!!!!
i don't care WHAT you want to believe!!!  you can come and have your meetings
and talk about how evil all the queers are and how good all of you
tight-assed filthy Christians are because you've accepted god --
but in the process you've forsaken what god wanted you to keep in mind
as much as himself -- YOUR FELLOW MAN...
so call me a CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  you're a HOMOPHOBE!!!  and you're damned,
right, I AM A CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  (I do have friends who are Christian,
but they seem to have more open minds than most of the Christians i've
talked to)...i'm scared to death that one day my sexual preference will
be OUTLAWED!!!  i'm already uneasy holding hands with my boyfriend in
public, though it seems an unspoken rule between us that we're not going
to hide our feelings for each other just because of what society thinks...
if you had your way, i might get ARRESTED for that!!!!  and why shouldn't
i be able to kiss him if i like??  don't you touch or kiss or hold hands
with YOUR Significant Other (wife, gf, whatever) in public??
just don't expect a warm welcome on my front porch when you come to tell
me i'm doomed to hell, or three of you get together with a bunch of chains
and beat up some of my friends coming out of a gay bar or you assault the
youngest of us (gay men and lesbians) that are part of your own flesh as
well, deny them their right to live and love as they choose and leave
them with scars that perhaps will never be erased...
if i was to come to your door bearing such glad tidings, i bet that you'd
pretend that you weren't home, too....

particularly new or novel to readers of net.motss, is not a central
purpose of net.motss, and has been successfully exorcised several

net.religion.christian, where both sides of the discussion can

What ever happened to it?  It's still active.  True, there are folk who will
decide that they should be the instruments of God's wrath.  On the other hand,
there are those who believe that they have to speak the truth as they see it,
just as you believe that you must be true to yourself.
Please, save your anger for the former group.  The latter are just as sincere
as you are, whether you can understand it or not.  They believe that they have
a duty, both to God and to YOU to speak as they do.

That circular track, for some lucky  people, is the belief that they should

where do you draw the line between believing that you are doing the right thing
and being self-righteous?  It isn't always obvious.

And there are PLENTY of Christians who will do the same thing.  That's
compassion and common sense and it does not contradict our instructions from
God.  Remember, Jesus ate with those ``known'' to be sinners.

For the thoughtful Christian, this is the crux of a moral dilemma:  Does
this orientation, not of an individual's choosing, give someone the burden
of obeying very severe laws that others are not burdened by?  Or does it give
them the right to contravene statements that appear (to many, anyway) to be
clear prohibitions?

Hmm.  I don't know anyone who does that.  As I said, there are dilemmas

we want to see you burn in Hell.''

For what it's worth, it was (and probably still is).  Most people nowadays

I doubt that you are speaking to your audience here.  It's unlikely that too
many people on this net are doing many of the things that you have described.
And the people engaging in assuaults such as those you describe are NOT
behaving in a very Christian manner, so perhaps flaming at Christians is not
speaking to your audience either.

What?  You don't eat, put your pants (or nylons) on one leg at a time,

Unfortunately, most Christians ignore the rest of that book of the Bible,
eating pork and shellfish, milk at the same meal as meat (and on the same
dishes, even), and only pick out these half dozen verses to claim as God's
Law out of Leviticus.  Isn't this a bit hypocritical?

You just want society to say that because what we are doing is 'not right'
(according to you), we should be allowed to be fired from our jobs, thrown
out of our houses...  Not quite burning at the stake, is it?  Burning is
faster!

Forutunately, even in those states where it is still illegal, the courts
are throwing such laws out (Texas was the last).  And I agree, Christian
intolerance has been going on for far to long.

But I know lots of young people who have been thrown out of their
Christian parents home because they were gay, often after being
subjected to avertion therapy, electo-shock therapy, or prayer
marathons.  Sorry, but they call themselves Christians and go to
Church 4 times a week and read their Bibles.  Jerry Falwell, that
'great Chrittian fellow' in the news for the last few years, tells
lies on his pulpit.  I can only go by what they tell me, since enough
of them act the same way, I assume its a Christian trait.  Even you
seem to want to 'keep me in my place' ('we don't want society to
endorse what you do').
Fuck off Christian!

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

  Forty percent of the single men in San Francisco are homosexual, and most of
them are well-educated and earning more than $20,000 a year, according to a
professional survey.
  The survey by the Research and Decisions Corporation, commissioned by the
city-financed SF AIDS Foundation, was designed to produce the first reliable
statistics on the city's homosexuals.
[This section heavily condensed]
Of 706,900 SF'ers, 69,960 are homosexual (based on 500 half-hour interviews).
32% of homosexual men in SF earn more than $30K, with 31% earning $20-$30K.
57% graduated from college, incl. 21% who continued in post-grad education.
42% of homosexual men in SF report they are in monogamous relationships and
13% have one primary relationship that includes outside sexual activity.
78% have all-male sexual partners, 14% are bisexual with mostly male partners
and 7% are bisexual with mostly female partners.
More than half of the homosexual men are in professional-managerial positions
or operate their own businesses.  Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.
About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,
with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.
A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliability
of the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed off
to them because they're gay.""  However, he also noted that many affluent
homosexuals were moving into San Francisco.

It is important to note a few important things about that survey:
1) that the survey was NOT a random sample,
2) the 500 were TELEPHONE interviews and more than 10% of the 
   salaries reported have already been declared as inflated
   and the investigation has just begun...think about it -
   if you weren't making much money and someone asked you
   how much you were making, in a telephone interview, wouldn't
   you be inclined to inflate it a little bit???
Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms,
and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia
from growing up in a world determined to assume that
everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are
all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia -
like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the
view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia
could be used against us...
just a thought from a lesbian here in sf...

This information had to be obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request
by Congress & from a 33-page report issued by Weiss' HSGOH.  ""CDC fiercely
opposed"" the FIA request, & was FORCED to surrender the desired memoranda
when the CDC refusal was appealed & publication of some of the memos by
Weiss' HSGOH in their report seemed imminent.
The released information revealed:
1. ""Some of the same officials who assured Congress that the federal gov't
had all the AIDS money it needed were privately pleading for more funds
from budget officials.""  CDC AIDS Task Force coord. Dr. James Curran notably
indulged in this form of prevarication, almost constantly claiming he had
or would soon receive funds that he knew didn't even exist!
2. ""Within 5 months of its formation, the CDC's AIDS Task Force (ATF) was
vainly begging the agency management for more funds & shortages have seri-
ously retarded the CDC's efforts throughout the AIDS epidemic.""
3. ""Much of the money that the CDC did spend on AIDS was diverted from
other important health needs.""
4. ""The failure to expediate funds for AIDS research meant that no
significant outlay of funds reached researchers until March 1983--
almost two years after AIDS was first detected.""
5. ""Serious misunderstandings about which federal agencies would handle
various aspects of the AIDS epidemic also seriously delayed research.""
CDC has received a ""good press"" from the media (excluding the gay press
which knew better, & was virtually alone in being critical & following
events closely), yet all during this period (1981-3) it was in fact
starved for funds.
Here's a closer history of events as revealed in internal HHS memos:
As early as June 1981 the CDC knew that AIDS was a serious epidemic:
they'd assigned staffers to it from its VD project.  By December
""when the number of cases had soared"", they were aware of the
magnitude of the task.  But they severely lacked funds.  Curran sub-
mitted a 6-months budget for a piddling $833,300.  But HHS did not
respond.  AT ALL.  Finally, Congress allocated $500,000 in August,
8 months late.  REAGAN VETOED THE APPROPRIATION.
Congress overturned the veto, & Curran finally received the money in
September.  By that time, the number of cases had quintupled.
Funding for 1983 ""fared little better"".  Administration budget cutters 
forced CDC to recalculate its budget THREE TIMES, the final AIDS figure
being 60% below the original one.  CDC Aids Task Force director Dr.
William Rushing included the following with his budget proposal:  ""As
you know, the attached budget is insufficient to adequately fund AIDS
surveillance & epidemiologic studies.  However, we will continue with\the
highest priority activities until additional funds become available.""
Finally Congress alllocated $2 million more for the CDC in December 1982;
""like other money that Congress would later appropriate, however, the
AIDS funding came in spite of the statements of federal health officials,
not because of them.""
In August 1982 the CDC wanted to set up a national AIDS surveillance
system, but had no money for it.  For the next 18 months, CDC ""depended
on doctors & health officials to call them up & tell them about AIDS
cases..."", an absurd situation for a federal health agency to be in
during a national epidemic.
""We lost all that data -- two years of cases are now irretrievable. All
that time I was saying we should do the work & Curran was telling us he
didn't have the money,"" said Dr. David Ostrow, an AIDS researcher at
Northwestern.
Researchers weho do get funds got inadequate ones:  SF's Dr. Andrew Moss
received $30,000 to monitor AIDS epidemiology for the CDC.  ""They give
you $30,000 -- it;s such an interesting sum.  It's too much to turn down,
but not enough to do anything meaningful.  It's similar to everything
about AIDS.""
The CDC AIDS Tsk Force's major piece of work, a case control study, was
published 18 months after it was finished;  epidemiologists criticized
its findings as ""sorely out of date"".
The Reagan administration's AIDS effort continued to be ""malnourished,
slipsod, disorganized, & bogged down by cumbersome bureaucracy"" in
1983.  By May, Brandt was alarmed & wrote to the HHS asst. sec. for
mamangement & budget:  ""It has now reached the point where important
AIDS work cannot be undertaken because of the lack of available re-
sources.""  Then CDC director Dr. William Foege added a long list of
projects ""postponed, delayed, or seriously curtailed"" because ""money
was diverted to AIDS.  These included studies on hepatitis, influ-
enza among the elderly, & rabies.""
""Just two weeks later, however, Thomas Donelly, who is in charge of
budgets at HHS, wrote a senate staffer that `we are not in favor of
additional appropriations' for AIDS research.""
""Brandt, Foege, & other health officials were also testifying before
Congress that they had enough funds for AIDS even while they were
privately begging for more money.""
In late May the House was about to pass an appropriation of an extra
$12 million for AIDS; at this time Brandt wrote ""that while the HHS
was not requesting more funds, they would `not oppose' having the
authority to transfer $12 million from other parts of the budget
into AIDS""!!
In September, HSGOH decided to add $22 million to the administration's
$17 million request (""only a 20 % increase over the previous year's
budget levels"").  HSGOH ""staffers think Republican committee members
leaked word to the administration because days later, Margaret Heckler.
secretary of HHS, made a highly-publicized announcement that the adminis-
tration would commit $40 million to AIDS research next year.  Heckler's
announcement did not mention thatthis allocation was a FAIT ACCOMPLI
because of the secret House vote--and it did not mention that even the
$40 million was $10 million BELOW whatthe CDC requested for AIDS research.""
""`Normally when you have an epidemic, the health people are begging you
for money', fumed Congresswoman Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, who co-
sponsored legislation for more AIDS funding.  `Here we were begging them
for information on what they needed & they kept telling us that they didn't
need any money.  It was unbelievable.'""
""In Washington, Dr. Edward Brandt, the administration's top health official,
brushed aside suggestions that he had been dishonest about the federal AIDS
effort.  He didn't need to ask for money, he insisted, because Congress
gave it to him anyway.
`By the time I put in a request & it goes through all the processes,
Congress passes the money [indeed!],' Brandt told the Native.  `It's
difficult to ever say you have enough money.  In one sense, as long as
you have the disease, you could say we don't have enough money.  All I
can say is that the money is there now.'""
""Though most scientists agree that the long-delayed money is now coming
from the federal government, some think that the government has irretriev-
ably lost its credibility with the scientific community.""
""Weiss' report requests that the gov't institute policies to expedite
funding of research grants &, most significantly, establish an independent
[of CDC, HHS] commission to map an overall strategy to fight AIDS.... The
budget would THEN BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO CONGRESS, CIRCUMVENTING THE
REAGAN BUDGET SLASHERS [my italics].  The panel itself implicitly reflects
the most serious charge within just about every paragraph of [HSGOH's]
report: the Reagan administration has been lying through its teeth about
the adequacy of AIDS funding for 2 years.""
There is much more information & events described in Shilts' article.
But the hour grows late, & my fingers are getting tired.
As some kind of a bench mark to make sense of the dollar amounts mentioned
above, a while ago HHS asked for funds merely to develop a few tests for
animal experiments preparatory to the real bulk of research; they asked for
at least $197 million.  Also remember that Congressional appropriations
amounts are limited by a factor the administration isn't:  the constant
obstacle of a Reagan veto.
[Gay Community News, 10/27/84, Jim Ryan, ""Health Director Resigns"", p. 1]
Ass't Sec. of HHS Dr. Edward Brandt, the nation's top physician, resigns
at the end of this year.  For all his shortcomings in performance & his
prevaricating, Brandt is a competent professional who showed a willingness
to work with gay organizations and was free of political ideology, if not
influence.
""The direction & extent of the gov't's research [on AIDS] depends in no
small measure on who is appointed to replace Brandt.... Any decision on
a successor will emanate from the Oval Office.""  That is, on tomorrow's
election result.
""Many fear"" Reagan will nominate C. Everett Koop, currently Surgeon Gene-
ral.  He's been ""widely criticized for his opposition to abortion, for
making numerous homophobic remarks, & for close ties to fundamentalist
Christian organizations.
Brandt was given credit for obtaining more AIDS funds at one point:  he
leaked a letter he wrote to his boss, Margaret Heckler, forcing Heckler's
hand.  Apparently Brandt thought there was good reason to believe Heckler
would deny or (more probably) ignore his request for more funds.  Heckler
had previously sat on an urgent AIDS funds request for six months doing
nothing; in that period of time, 500 more people had died of AIDS.

Noting the landslide victory (electoral votes) and large margin

assume that US voters prefer Reagan to Mondale.  If you truly believe

Oh boy, America love it or leave it, eh?  You know, it's not that
easy.  Most other countries aren't too keen on granting political
asylum to yanks, and in general make it difficult to find steady
employment.  And they know when they've got a good thing.  This ""you
choose to live here"" business is nonsense.  The fact that I am free
to visit most any place in the world does not mean I can become a
citizen there, let alone work.
US is best?  Most desirable?  How do you know, not to mention rank
order?  The US is not best on most of the popular health statistics
(like lifespan or infant mortality indices), nor per capita income,
not to mention crime.  There are many other democracies that appear
to be about as politically and economically free as the US, and with a
much better quality of life.
Ah, but *we* can blow every one of 'em to kingdom come with the
touch of a button.  Lucky us.

Why do people always say this?  Everyone has the freedom to think what
they want.  I, too, think this is at least one of the best (if not the
best) countries in the world to live in.  One of the things I don't
think is so great about it is the fact that Ronald Reagan is president.
I am not a 'political animal' and admittedly not very good at defending 
my beliefs (mainly because I don't like to argue with people).  But this
doesn't mean I'm wrong, and it also doesn't mean I have no right to live
in this country.  I don't think it's right of you to deny another
citizen the right to complain.  After all, if nobody ever complained,
nothing would ever change, and we would still be toggling programs into
our computers.

I didn't even say Ron has no right to live here.  What I did say was,
if he is not willing to make constructive suggestions, maybe he would
do better somewhere else, somewhere he is willing to build instead of
destroy.

I completely agree with you here, too.  I believe that responsible
disagreement is the source of all progress.  
I also believe that people who can, do, and people who can't try to 
tear down those who can.  What I was trying to oppose was the gratuitious 
criticism in the absence of constructive alternatives.  I even support 
criticism of the ""I think something is wrong here, but I'm not sure what 
to do about it."" variety.  But it doesn't seem to me that Ron's
comments fall into either category.  And when, after the election, he
posted that sour grapes article, I felt moved to reply.
For those of you who might like to know, I think:
 - given the alternatives, US voters made the superior chioce.
 - neither party has a viable foreign policy, but I'm not sure exactly
   how I want it changed
 - the most pressing problem facing the US right now is
   government mismanagement of fiscal affairs
 - elimination of nuclear weapons is mandatory, the focus should
   be on getting both the US & the USSR to agree to ANY necessary
   technique for verifying compliance, treaties should include
   specific numbers of specific weapons and prohibition against
   ANY upgrade or enhancement or deployment of ANY new offensive
   weapon or system, defensive technology should be public knowledge;
   NOW WHO HAS ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO GET THE USSR TO AGREE?

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

I tolerate liberals in net.politics -- though it appears some have
great difficulty tolerating me.) And I think that most net.motss
readers, gay and otherwise, agree. (Let me also reject the complaint
not noted above, that he has no answers to the problems he raises.
Who does?) Leaving, of the three types of complaints I noted, that he
is frequently unintelligible and rude.
On to intelligibility. I frequently find such luminaries as Sartre,
Connell, Eliot, Hamsun, Lagerkvist, Pynchon, Brecht, Ionesco, and
Baudelaire... unintelligible. On the other hand, I sometimes find
them intelligible, which sustains me in reading their works. And I
have found that it is generally true that just that which makes them
so often unintelligible makes their message, when I am hit with it,
so forceful. Now, one need not include Ken in the list above -- i.e.,
as of the same rank -- to consider the possibility that his style suits
him as the best to get across his points. To make a point, it may
sometimes be necessary to strike the listener in the face with a dead
fish. Would you reduce the efforts of, say, Ionesco to that which would
fit on a bumper sticker? (It would save a lot of trees; ""The Lesson""
could be reduced to ""Communication is Fraught with Difficulty,"" and
certainly everyone would understand that communication.) Would
you wait till the author died, and read the books of criticism about
the author's work? It's usually easier than reading the work itself.
Would you have the author write an essay as dull as this one (albeit
in better prose, no doubt)? Or would you admit the possibility that the
author embedded his meaning as much in the form of his work as in the
words? That in order to understand it, you had to do more than
intellectualize? (I remember, from Personality Theory or Abnormal
Psychology, when the professor explained ""intellectualization"" as
the defense mechanism which enabled 150 male students to hear him say
something like ""All males hate their fathers because they secretly want
to have sexual intercourse with their mothers,"" busily write it down,
and wait for the next point. Having missed the last one.)
Not that I think I've convinced anyone of anything, but let's get on
to rudeness. Really not getting on at all, since the same point
raised above -- that attention may be better commanded by striking
the listener in the face with a dead fish than by writing a deadly
boring essay such as I am now doing -- applies here. Maybe you
should regard Arndt as an onion in the stew of life, and not expect
your reasoned arguments to turn him into a carrot.
The suggestion has been tendered that someone, not Ken, who reads
an Arndt message and espies some redeeming quality there, translate
the message for the edification of the remainder of the crew. A bad
idea, I think, but since I am filled (indeed, brimming over) with
polite language (rather gray, but it doesn't disturb anyone as long
as I don't mention National Review), let me try an example. Ken
recently wrote in an article that when in boot camp he felt sorry
for a crying recruit who was kicked by every other recruit who passed
him, including, when Ken got to him, Ken. Some net.motss readers
read this as a brave ""coming out of the closet"" on Ken's part,
others as an expression of Ken's wimpiness/rudeness/brutality.
Enter Mr. Explain-it-in-all-gray-tones! Ahem. ""In the message from
Ken, which you are not reading because its style, nay, its very
language, was deemed inappropriate, Ken related an anecdote, or
perhaps a parable, to the effect that today's polite sympathy may not
translate into polite actions on the morrow."" Really grabbed you, eh?
Thought so.
(You know, as I was mentally composing this essay, I kept hearing
Muzak playing when I thought of the brave new world we all expect
when everyone talks and writes ever so politely, and reasonably,
like, say, me. I couldn't figure out why the damned Muzak was
playing for a couple of hours, when I suddenly was hit by the
shopping market scene at the end of ""Stepford Wives."" I'd explain
the scene in words, but I'm afraid I'd gray so far as to disappear.)
Listen, I suspect two things: That Ken is damned nigh well unique
(certainly on this net), and that the kind of person many net.motss
readers think he is, is not. It's the latter you've got to look
out for and try to sway. Run off to mod.motss if you will, where
the moderator will protect you from immoderate opinions -- but
if everything turns to shit, and the world comes tumbling down
on your head, please refrain from asking ""But they all seemed so
nice! What happened?""
I can sense that some of you (most of you?) are still unconvinced.
Very well, in better polite language than my own...
     ""Perhaps there is really no such thing as a Revolution
     recorded in history. What happened was always a Counter-
     Revolution. Men were always rebelling against the last
     rebels; or even repenting of the last rebellion. This
     could be seen in the most casual contemporary fashions,
     if the fashionable mind had not fallen into the habit of
     seeing the very latest rebel as rebelling against all
     ages at once. The Modern Girl [this written in 1933]
     with the lipstick and the cocktail is as much a rebel
     against the Women's Rights Woman of the '80's, with her
     stiff stick-up collars and strict teetotalism, as the
     latter was a rebel against the Early Victorian lady of the
     languid waltz tunes and the album full of quotations from
     Byron; or as the last, again, was a rebel against a
     Puritan mother to whom the waltz was a wild orgy and
     Byron the Bolshevist of his age. Trace even the Puritan
     mother back through history and she represents a rebellion
     against the Cavalier laxity of the English Church, which
     was at first a rebel against the Catholic civilisation,
     which had been a rebel against the Pagan civilisation.
     Nobody but a lunatic could pretend that these things
     were a progress; for they obviously go first one way and
     then the other.""

City, New York, pp. 76-77, 1956. Which is, of course, irrelevant
because it was written by (a) a conservative who (b) is dealing with
a religious topic.]
Of course, Ken may be simply as you see him: a rude and unintelligible
boor. Yes, Ken could be exactly what many of you think he is, a bad
boy so typical of the religious right. So typical.
Keep your eyes on him.

""unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", ""rude""?  Do you actually read
either Arndt's or anyone else's postings in net.motss?  (I'm get-
ting tired of asking this rather rhetorical question, but the
myopia on this net is just unbelievable!)
SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson 
are that they're bigoted, insulting, exhibitionistic in really loathsome
ways (like, for example, street psychotics), filled with hatred and
self-hatred, etc. etc.  And this adds up to merely ""rude""?  Is it
merely ""rude"" to call a group of blacks ""filthy niggers"" who ought
to be ""hung from the nearest available tree"" AND then launch into,
say, ""rational"" discussion of race relations and the legislative
agenda before Congress?  And then swerve into a polemic denouncing
funding for sickle cell anemia (""Let 'em die!  We'll finally have
social peace!""), and discourse repetitively & at great length about
the genetic disposition of black men to commit rape (of white women,
that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt
Phenomenon is that bigoted and deliberately offensive postings 
are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this
option at all.

apologists for Arndt's behavior.  We are discussing, not ""supportiveness""
(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability to
treat a discussion and its members seriously.  Right now, there is
only one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.
Let's get one thing clear here.  If he acted this way in any other
newsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank.  If he behaved in
public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

It looks for all the world like HLTVIII is the bug responsible for AIDS.
Its origins may be Nigeria (though the Kaposi's sarcoma stuff looks
similar, it's a symptom rather than a near relative) by way of the Carib.
Further, serum is the media that the little cyto-megalovirus lives in,'
but the transmission (read vector here) is *overwhelmingly* limited to
the seriously promiscous element of the gay community...with the exception
of those members of the popluation (usually hemophiliac) who cannot use
filtered blood, and those (usually bisexual) in direct contac with the
above mentioned.
What steps are being taken in the gay community to address the issue of
AIDS....control, spread, etc. I am personally inclined to view it in
much the same manner as any other venereally transmitted disease (save
for the obvious fact that gonorrhea isn't fatal, and doesn't have a similiar
etiology)...controlling the disease is a question of habit. To the extent
that the gay agenda for increased civil recognition *requires* a broad-based
coalition within the gay community, does the potential ""self-policing""
of the gay community represent a an internal threat to the coalition
necessary for gay rights?
If Phil Ngai and the spokesperson on NPR for the gay/lesbian coalition 
last night on the bathhouse closings are to be believed, the issue
*has* begun to move into the political and judicial spotlight. Must the
SF department of public health move to close the bathhouses because
the gay community has for some reason refused to close the places
themselves?

Glad you said that my statement to the effect that Aids is ""homosexually
vectored"" is SOMEWHAT imprecise!  Because it's not imprecise by much if
at all.  ""Intermingling of blood"", yes but not from bumping into each other,
unless . . . (but I'm trying to change).  It's not the fact of transfusions
(the act) that causes Aids!  I get Aids from a carrier who donated blood.
The carriers are identified as . . . (fill in the blanks).  You seem to be
saying pouring blood causes Aids!  ""Aids is transmitted through the inter-
mingling of blood supply as might happen with transfusion.""
By the way, Aids is also transmitted through semen and some feel through
saliva.
What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious
problem to the entire population . . . "" mean??  The point of my postings
was that very fact!!!
Where do you read my ""smug assurance"" of my own safety??
I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children
with Aids.  About 70 so far, with hundreds more projected.  They highlighted
the problems of one little boy under sentence of death (are you SURE that
homosexuals are not responsible just a little - even those not promiscuous
but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
Hey, it's getting bigger by the minute.  You've got to do more than raise
funds, teach each other to check for sores first and man hotlines.  Hint:
You've got to speak to fellow gays about behavior patterns (which might
entail relooking at ""lifestyles"" ((baths, bars, etc.))).
How about looking at the ""sexual revolution""?  Remember the young Aids
victim I quoted as saying, ""We were told that sex was liberating and more
sex was more liberating.""
Rich Johnson I believe it was, whines about, ""what ever happened to 'do your
own thing?'""  It never was.  One person alone to the limits of nature but
not in a society.  That's the reason for government.  Laws.
Another, Gerber, asks ""am I my brother (homosexual's) keeper?""  What a waste-
land if the answer to that is no!!
As Aids and it's cost get bigger the public is going to look for SCAPEGOATS!
Guess who?  Think all those nice pols are going to help you then?
So rather than marching with Sister Boom Boom and the Children's Crusade
you should be marching the other way!  Dump the freaks before they drag -:
you down with them.  Of course by dump them I mean their positions.

approve of Mr. Ardnt.
From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct 10, 1984.
In a prepared statement on Tuesday, San Francisco public health director
Mervyn Silveman said ""These businesses (gay bathhouses) have been
inspected on a number of occasions and demonstrate a blatant disregard for
the health of their patrons and of the community.
	""Make no mistake about it. These 14 establishments are not
fostering gay liberation. They are fostering disease and death.""
	He then ordered the commercial sex establishments closed.
Silverman had threatened to close the bathhouses and other commercial
sex establishments last March, but instead ordered a ban on sex in such
establishments in the city. Silverman said his decision (to close the
bathhouses) was reached because ""we now have solid evidence that AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease - often spread by people who are unaware that
they are carrying the virus. The virus, he said, has been found in 40 to 50
percent of the gay male population in San Francisco.

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the

Chickenhawks indeed!!!!
Is this discussion going to turn into another piece of homogenized crap
on the general topic of homosexual ""lifestyles"" without anyone other than
myself speaking up?  Despite Ken Perlow's assertion to the contrary, I very
clearly said I was speaking against PROMISCUOUS behavior and invited others
to examine that as a ""lifestyle"" issue in light of its physical (AIDS, etc.)
and psychological implications.  I believe I remember one, maybe two people
addressing the issue as minor points in their postings.
Did anyone see the recent T.V. ""Silent Shame"" show about child abuse?  They
mentioned ""chickenhawks"".  Had a member of the Rene Guyon Society (10,000
members in the U.S.) who came right out and SAID what they say in their
literature!  They have a RIGHT to our kids!!!!!!  WE are wrong for not letting
them have them!!!  They want LAWS!!!  Hey, the ""right"" SS will march if 
this gets anywhere.  
SO OTHER THAN A FEW WEAK, ""I DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS"", HOW DO THE MEMBERS OF
THE NET FEEL?   For, against, won't march with them, not your problem (if you
believe that you're crazy), might even speak out against them (Why?)???
But read from their literature:
ANAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT (italics
theirs), can easily hold after massage, and will be allowed to have a teen-
ager or older male's condom-covered penis in their anus.  Tiny children will
be required to wear a small ""finger stall"" or ""finger cot"" (obtainable from
a drug store) condom from age 4 or any earlier age that they start penetrating
male and female anuses.  99% of the day there is no fecal matter in the anus.
No enema is required.
ORAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT, can easily
hold, and will be allowed to have a tiny child, teenager, or older male's penis
in their mouth.  This will bring an end to thumbsucking.  The child will at 
last get valuable hormones that appear in the mature male's ejaculate that have
been denied children in the past.  Very young, teenage and adult females will
be allowed to provide sexual satisfaction with their mouths and tongues to the
penis and clitoris of young children.

And it goes on, PENIS-VAGINA COPULATION, MASTURBATION, NUDITY ALONE WITH NO
SEXUAL ACTIONS, but I'm sick of typing what I'm typing.
 
The main purpose of the organization is to convince the public that all laws
controlling nonconsensual sex must be abolished.

NOW PLEASE NOTE:  I am NOT trying to tar all homosexuals with the same brush.
I am asking the homosexual community just what they propose to do about these
people in their movement. (I know what I propose to do)  Something, nothing??
It would really freak me out to see you pass over this topic as if it were
like wearing women's undergarments.
Question:  Is this a topic that is just to early to push for acceptance by
the public?  I mean, after the law recognizes homosexual ""rights"" is this
the next barrier?  Is there any last barrier?  Or will someone really marry
a tree?

haven't seen anything quite like this before.  What mailing lists is he
on anyway?
Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rights
very early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for total
self-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this was
not limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referred
to) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them.  I
don't think there's much more to be said here.
All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly try
to dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA.  The key to
remember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and the
only groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and the
members of such groups themselves.  Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerpts
from pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of both
female and male children: where are the gay issues here?  Why did Arndt not
take this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,
where he could take the straight community to task for their own shameful
members?  Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.
One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.
Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to
""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,
""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""
Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gay
community (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gay
community.)  Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very small
minority supports the aims of such groups, with most people either
against or indifferent.
One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS and
promiscuity haven't received a response.  Nope, they haven't, and it's no
wonder.  Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, but
unfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority of
net.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior.  It's actually pretty
hilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needs
to do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guise
of martyr.  Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, and
by my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlier
behavior.  We'll see.

Oh boy, another California lunatic fringe group, and Arndt goes all to

are you going to do about Germany's neo-Nazis?  Or closer to home,
the American Nazi Party?  When you hear Meir Kahane speak, do you
assume that he speaks for all Jews?  Or Jerry Falwell for all Christians?

	I have been following the conversation somewhat episodically over 
the last few months, due to problems with local (computer!) 
authorities, but I could not help noticing the extent to which 
the responses to Mr. Arndt and his clones have managed to force 
their way into nearly every single letter written to this group. 
This has now progressed to the point where all of the letters currently
available at my institution in this newsgroup are either written by the 
Arndt Gang, or are replies to them. This situation is not new: 
many of you probably remember that
Arndt managed for some time to disrupt the debate also in net.women, from 
which he was eventually expelled, never to reappear again. It is unlikely,
though, that this will happen here too: differently from that case, now 
Mr. Arndt is persuaded to be waging a Holy War, and nothing we say will
make him desist from it. You all know how impermeable he is to every sort
of argumentation, how uninterested he is in listening, and how badly he has
damaged discussion in this group.
	There are two possible soultions to this problem: the first is what 
was proposed some time ago in net.women, i.e. the creation of a private 
mail group from which any non-constructive contribution could be easily 
excluded. This feminist mail group is now alive and prospering, has received
more than 300 contributions, and the environment is so pleasant that 
quite a number of people have told intimate personal stories. This is a 
possible way out. 
	Alternatively, one may reason as follows: women's movements have 
gained a degree of acceptance which gay-rights movements are very far from
achieving, so that the retreat into a private mailgroup, which would be
quite acceptable for women, is to be considered a political defeat in this
case. Holding the debate in a public forum like this is also a part 
of 'coming out', and we shouldn't allow Mr. Arndt and his clones to shut
evryone up, and lock the closet again.
	I see some pluses in this line of argument. But in this case, 
we should probably accept the obvious: no debate is possible with Mr. Arndt
and the hypocrites who disapprove of his ways and approve of his ideas 
(which ones?) and of his carefully researched data (straight out of 
Jerry Falwell's pocket). We should then propose and enforce a policy of
total neglect of Mr. Arndt, one by which none of his arguments is mentioned
in any contribution, none of his lurid jokes and insinuations are 
answered, none of his clones' support respected.
	This is very different from rejecting debate: it would only
mean restoring this forum to its original function (message # 1):
>Net.motss is designed to foster discussion on a wide variety of topics, such as
>health problems, parenting, relationships, clearances, job security and
>many others.  Gay members of USENET will find this a supportive environment

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much
of this article was taken.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of
what Arndt wrote--you don't have to choose a side on any of the underlying
issues to label what he wrote ""stupid in the extreme"".

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays. 
Important disclaimer from you is ""gay men"". Right, women don't fit

For instance, net.bizarre actually has enough readers but is of
such low quality that I don't think anybody will miss it, and is
of such high volume that it'll make a big dent in our phone bills
if we throw it away.
Why am I posting a local administrative matter to the net
as a whole?  I'm hoping to raise consciousness on the net, and
start some general conversation about the usefulness of these groups.
Hopefully this will be the only large posting (And, please people,
don't quote the entire thing!)

David, sorry for the long inclusion, but there are two points:
1. Am I not getting all of net.music.folk? As a ""folkie"" I eagerly await the
   one or two posting per week average I see here. Hardly what I would call
   middle to high volume. Perhaps there is a site somewhere upstream of us that
   has decided that this group is worthless and has turned it off.
2. A small but not insignificant contributor to article length is.. (I know,
   it's been said a hundred times before!) long .signature files. I consider
   7 lines long (please, this isn't intended to be a flame!).

	We just went through the same problem, but since we are a computer
science department, we decided to keep only computer related groups.
The only large groups that we still get are net.sources and net.unix-wizards.
We managed to cut out about 75% of our news, the administration is happy,
and we realized how much of the news is crap.  All the talk about information
overload and the net collapsing under it's own weight is apparently true.

net.abortion, net.politics, net.flame, net.religion, and net.origins are the
kind of groups that by their natures seem to distribute a large amount of
opinion, especially of the I'm-right-you're-wrong-and-that's-all-there-is-
to-it sort. The justifications for creating net.abortion and net.origins (as
I recall) were that people were overflowing other notesfiles (lots of
abortion debates in net.women, lots of creationism debates in net.religion,
and lots of both in net.flame). Rather than try and convince people not to
rehash the same debates over and over, they were given their own pastures
and left to run wild. I personally would not miss any of them, and it would
certainly go a long way towards reducing phone bills.
Oddly, I don't think net.motss fits this category. This notesfile serves
several purposes. It is an obvious vehicle for disseminating information on
AIDS, at least until it begins to affect heterosexuals in larger numbers. It
is used by people who are different from most of the people they work with
to communicate with others like them across the country, with little
harassment (aside from Ken Arndt's random visits and those of shocked
bible-belters). It is also a way for straights to learn more about how gays
think and live, and education has to make acceptance easier, right?
And then we come to the groups close to my heart: net.aviation,
net.sf-lovers, and net.books. You can't justify groups like these as easily
as something like mod.sources, but many, many people read sf-lovers, not all
books are sf so it's nice to have net.books, too, (shouldn't we support
reading in this age of declining literacy?), and wherever you get a group of
pilots together they're bound to swap flying stories, and I love to listen
to flying stories. What would Jeff Williams do with himself if you did away
with net.aviation?
And while I don't read it myself, if there are readers in net.railroad I
think it should stay around, just out of respect for all the old- and
not-so-old-timers who got into this business through messing with model
railroads and blue boxes.

I think the point that krahl missed is that David posted a list of
newsgroups that were candidates for HIS SITE to stop supporting.  He
is in the process of finding out whether anyone on HIS SITE can make
a case for keeping any of the groups.  I did the exact same thing on
one machine I administer news on a few months ago, cut the disk space
used by about 20%, and the space used is currently higher than it was
before trimming groups that NO ONE ON MY SITE WANTED.  I am administering
news on a smaller machine now, as well.  The machine has a total of
102Meg of disk space and we get very few groups to start with.  Do the
news administrators have the right to stop supporting groups that should
be mailing lists (low volume) or moderated but aren't (low quality)?
You're damn right, we do.  If my users can't get their work done because
netnews is tying up too much disk space, or too many cycles, or too many
hours on the FOUR incoming or ONE outgoing lines on the system, we won't
support ANY groups at all.  Even in some parts of AT&T, the budget
allotment for netnews is ZERO dollars.  If krahl wants to pass around
a lot of crap with his cycles and dialers, fine.   I'll pass, thank you.

The first thing I noticed was where these two people are *from*!  The one
is an AT&T employee and probably doesn't have to worry about his phone
bills (:-).  The second is from a University and is expressing the exact
opinions which have been expressed around here.  i.e.  Given a limited 
amount of support for receiving news and a seemingly unlimited supply
of news, why is *EVERYTHING* necessary???
Yes, Mr. Krahl, I do want to lower the phone bill by cutting newsgroups.
And, no, I won't kill the net by doing so because I'm not asking the
net to kill newsgroups, I'm simply intending to cut them locally.  On
the other hand, if the net were to see this suggestion and agree that
all those newsgroups were worthless and needed to be cut I wouldn't cry.
What's a poor university to *do*?!?!?

Actually, when you're talkinga about removing availability of groups from a
small population, it makes sense to sample that population. If you're
talking about removing groups from a large population, you need a more
scientific approach. It WAS interesting, though to compare his stuff to
what is happening out here in the bay area where people are doing
readership surveys on a regional basis... I found it rather suprising which
groups don't seem to have a lot of following on a pretty wide ranging
basis.

Actually, I doubt the insurance companies would go for this.  It only solves
half of the issue (if it even does that).  Suppose, that I (with my seatbelt
discount) go out driving with me belt on and run into (my fault) someone else
who is not wearing their seatbelt.  My policy is still obliged to pay.

So social darwinism rears its ugly head on the net.  I was just reading
something like this earlier today.  Let me see...  here it is:
    Social Darwinists, following the English social theorist Herbert
    Spencer, thought all such regulation unwise.  ""Very many of the
    poorer classes are injured by druggists' prescriptions and quack
    medicines, Spencer willingly conceded.  But there was nothing wrong
    in that; it was the penalty nature attached to ignorance.  If the
    poor died of their own foolishness, the species would improve.""
		   -- Paul Starr, ""The Social Transformation of
		      American Medicine,"" quoted in the Texas Observer
Funny.  I thought that the cruder examples of this sort of thinking had died
out some time ago.  Obviously they haven't (unless our friend was merely
being facetious).
I've got an even better idea -- why not actively discourage the use of
seatbelts with a heavy tax?  If the social darwinists are right, that should
increase not only the world's average intelligence but its average wealth as
well!  :-{

No offense intended, but this is just the kind of thing that makes lawyers
have unassisted orgasms, makes judges commit suicide, makes insurance
company execs give smug little I'll-get-that-extra-Mercedes-this-year-
after-all smiles, and makes your average Joe's wallet look like an
Ethiopian famine victim.
Who is to decide that an accident could have been prevented by wearing a
seatbelt?  If the insurance company doesn't want to pay the injured all
they have to do is start too long, too expensive court battle to wear
the injured, the courts, and the rest of us down.  This area is far too
subjective and nebulous to be put into an arena where it can cause so
much grief.
My solution to seatbelt, helmet, anti-suicide, and other such 'preventative'
laws is simple:  get rid of them.  You're going to tell me that I can't
take a risk that endangers no one but me?  You're going to tell me that
I can't kill myself if I want to?  Rubbish!
By the way, the You in ""You're going to tell me...."" above is not
directed at Peter, just at legislators in general.
They let people hang-glide and water-ski without helmets, don't they?

When Texas was considering its recently enacted seat-belt law, this very
thing was proposed as an alternative.  It got shot down primarily by
practical considerations--If a non-seat belt user was in an accident, it
was pointed out, all they had to do (assuming they were conscious),
was to quickly buckle up their belts before the dust settled.
Obviously this argument has a few holes, but nobody ever lost money
betting on the lack of intellectual quality of Texas legislators..(-: :-)

While the risks may endanger no-one but you (perhaps), its not true that
they harm no-one but you.  When you are injured, your insurance pays you,
and I pay your insurance company.  You sit in hospital and use the last
bed, so the hospital has to build a new wing, and I pay for it.  You
croak, and use the last cheap plot in the cemetery, so now I have to
buy a more expensive one.  After all this, your ""freedom"" has still
not stopped costing me ...  Now your ex-employer has to employ someone
else, and train them, I pay more for his product.
So, please, if you want to kill yourself, do it in some way that
everyone knows that's what you are doing, and make sure that you
succeed, no insurance, no hospital.  That still doesn't recover
all the costs, but it at least will save some of them.  Remember
that society has an investment in you - you owe us!

on the costs (and causes) of auto fatalities.  It had two parts:
1. an estimate of the total cost to the society as a whole of
   an auto fatality (the cost to the police and hospitals to
   clean up the mess, the cost to the government of not collecting
   in taxes the cost of educating the individual, etc. etc.).
   The average fatality cost about $50,000.  This is paid for
   by everybody in higher taxes.
2. a study of every fatality in a specific model year of Volvos
   in Sweden (I think the year was 1975).  The study was done
   jointly by Volvo, the insurance companies, The National
   Traffic Safety Board, and the people who usually reconstruct
   airplane crashes.  There were 131 fatalities.  129 were not
   wearing seat belts.  (There was also one fire, although
   nobody could figure out why the car caught fire; Volvo moved
   the gas tank the next year.)
As a result of this study, Sweden passed a mandatory seat belt
law.
In addition to protecting you in a crash, a good seat belt will
support you if you have to swerve your car to avoid an accident,
thus preventing accidents as well.

An interesting viewpoint, and I can see your point somewhat, but:
a) You live in New York City (I know you don't, but pretend); there is
   a higher crime rate there, and when you get mugged your insurance
   company pays and I pay your insurance company.  I could give a lot
   more examples, but the basic line is that life (and ESPECIALLY
   insurance) ain't fair.  If you're interested in such things,
   definitely take the time to read _The_Invisible_Bankers_ by
   Andrew Tobias.
b) You hang glide and fly small planes, so you get injured and/or
   killed.  I pay.  Life is a bitch, ain't it?
My basic message here is much more objective than that:  There are
insurance discounts for non-smokers for the reasons that you put
forth above, and I like that because I am a non-smoker.  Am I really
a non-smoker?  Send me to your insurance company's doctor and I
guarantee you he can answer that question reliably unless I work
in a coal mine or in downtown L.A.  Now, do I really wear my
seatbelt all the time?  Who knows but me?

I owe you?  OK, I guess you're right -- I'll do my good deed by
reducing the population, not contributing to the rise in population
at a later date, not consuming anymore food, energy, or space; and
I'll lower the unemployment rate at the same time -- all by suicide!!
Pretty effective little act, isn't it?
As for your earlier point about you paying for this and that, what
about the jobs that I create in the insurance, health care, and
burial industries?  Not to mention the work afforded to florists (assuming
someone likes me enough to send flowers to either the hospital and/or
the funeral), the minister who reads my eulogy, the lawyers who squabble
over my estate, the coroner who does the autopsy... I could go on for
days!!
I think I'll go off myself right now; what a great feeling to be
benefiting others!!

One problem with the above solution is the difficulty in determining
whether or not seat-belts would have an advantageous effect or not.
Also, what happens when I hit someone (my fault) and they didn't have
a seat belt on? Am I less liable because they didn't wear one?
The new trend of mandatory seat-belt laws is so ridiculous! 
My home state of North Carolina is having their law go into 
effect Oct. 1. I am a habitual seat-belt user but I'm almost
ready to not wear them past Oct. 1. I think it's just another
excuse for police to inspect vehicles.
I fully support mandatory child restraint laws, however.
The difference: kids can't responsibly decide whether or
not to wear them and shouldn't be penalized by death for 
having bone-headed parents.

I believe that if a seat belt user is involved in an accident, the selt
belt will stretch enough that investigators can easily tell the selt belt
has been through an accident.
I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.

and non-user) would be a good idea.
It is claimed that it is easy to cheat.  In most accidents it
should be easy to tell.  A significant number of non-users end
up dead.  Others are unconscious.  Some are thrown clear of the
car, or across the car to the other side.  Others would be too
dazed to think of buckling up afterwards.  The nature of the
injuries would often be decisive.  For example, if a person's
forehead is caved in from hitting the dash the force of the
accident would probably cause belt bruises on wearers.
Showering glass particles would probably leave a shadow where
the belt is.  Patterns of blood on clothing and the belt would
indicate a lot to an investigator.
Even if people did successfully cheat some of the time, the
benefit in terms of lowered premiums to belt wearers would still
be sufficient to be desirable.
I am sure the insurance companies have statistics on how much
cost is incurred in paying to people in accidents who are
wearing seatbelts vs. those not wearing.  This would form the
basis for differential premiums, which I think would be rather
large.  Those carrying ""belted"" policies who are injured while
not wearing belts could be paid out at a rate proportional to
the differential.  Policies could be offered with four options:
(1) unbelted driver and passengers, (2) belted passengers,
unbelted driver, (3) belted driver, unbelted passengers, and (4)
belted driver and passengers.  The same differential payouts
could apply, although I think it would be advisable to only
offer two options depending on the driver wearing or not wearing
a belt and pay out for passengers regardless, since a passenger
often would not know what kind of policy the driver carries and
could in any case be purposely mislead by the driver.
The argument that requiring occupants to wear seatbelts
infringes on their freedom is often buttressed by analogy to
risky things like hang-gliding.  While I am less in favour of
seatbelt legislation as time goes by, (especially when choices
can be offered as in insurance options), I would like to refute
the argument.  The analogy is not strictly applicable since it
is impossible to hang-glide without hang-gliding but it is
possible to sit in a moving car wearing seat-belts.
The point that the foolishness of non-users costs all of us has
not been made strongly enough.  By far the greatest cost to
society is the loss of productivity and creativity from the
injured and the dead.  Of course, anyone has the right to be
unproductive and uncreative.
Seatbelts on drivers help them maintain their position at the
controls and therefore lessen the chance that they will lose
control after primary collisions or unforeseen gyrations (i.e.
skids).  Thus they lessen the chance that they will hit oncoming
traffic or pedestrians thereby injuring or killing innocent
bystanders.","BqLiEtCGqQgJ",1,1985-07-30,1,0

        I'm not to sure about that,  but  wouldn't  the  injuries  the
        person  wearing  the  seatbelt be identifibly different from a
        person who was  not  wearing  a  seatbelt?  In  a  high  speed

        bruises across the waist and  chest  where  the  straps  were.
        Also  a  person  wearing  a seatbelt would be unlikely to have
        suffered head injuries.

        wearing  seatbelts  doesn't  strike  me as very practical.  It

This is true. If fact, If you are in a moderately severe accident it is
recommended (at least by consumer reports) that you replace your seatbelts
because they cannot absorb a second shock as well and could possibly fail.

From experience, I can testify that this is true. It's surprising the kind of
evidence that a trained investigator can find. 
I had an accident where I was rear-ended by a car massing more than twice
mine, traveling about 35-50 MPH upon impact. I had my left-turn signal going
(and my brakes on -OUCH!-), which was verified by the particular way the
remnants of the bulb's filaments deposited themselves upon the remnants of
the bulb!
Anyway, why couldn't the insurance company simply nullify the policy if
the owner of the policy sustained injuries that wouldn't occur if he had
been wearing his belt? (I know, this merely narrows the margin where it
is questionable, yet it becomes pretty small.) I dislike paying higher
premiums because other people don't wear their belts.

    They don't even need to *try* to verify which of their customers actually
wears their seat belts.  All they'd have to do is to offer two types of
insurance: seat-belted and non-seatbelted.  The only difference would be that
seat-belted would cost less, and wouldn't pay for injuries caused by not
wearing seat belts.  As <someone> above points out, there should be big
differences in the types of injuries which occur so that a non-belted
driver using belted insurance wouldn't be able to fool anyone by putting the
belt on after the accident.

Points are well taken.  Being basically a libertarian by nature, I had
thought of the insurance non-payment plan as an alternative to the intrusive
nature of a seat belt law, but couldn't come up with a counter to the
""buckling up"" after the fact argument.
However, it does seem that from a legislative point of view, a variation
on the original argrument could be used.  Might not litigants argue that
they really did have their seat belts on, but the accident wasn't severe
enough to stretch them?  This is all promising, but I think we need
more information, and possibly a body of case law, to convince legislators...

Okay Bob, since I have a financial interest in your attitudes
and lifestyle, I expect to be able to influence your attitudes
and your lifestyle. Please submit to me (address below) a detailed
account of your personal habits. Please include such information
as:
	1. Eating habits (I don't want you to eat foods that
	   could give you health problems I would pay for.)
	2. Drinking and smoking behaviors (I won't pay for
	   your liver problems or lung cancer treatment.)
	3. Hobbies (No hang-gliding, white-water canoeing, etc...)
	4. Sexual behaviors (I want all your potential partners
	   to be certified AIDS and herpes free.)
I'm sure I have missed many relevant aspects of your life that
could cause me finacial distress. Once I have discussed these with
my fellow-society members, we will submit to you new life-style guidelines
that you will be forced to adhere to under penalty of law.

If the accident wasn't severe enough to stretch the seat belts,
then the medical damages ought to be very low.
If litigant's face is broken from hitting the windshield, even a jury is
unlikely to believe the seat belt was actually used. (where seat belt
means combination lap/shoulder belt)

In some states you are.  California used to be one, but I'm not sure if  it
still  is.  The  concept  involved  is  ""contributory negligence"".  If they

auto-dialed Jerry Falwell's 800 number hundreds of times a day for eight
months. For those who have missed news reports, this is the text of a piece
written for the Washington Post. All facts are current as of Jan. 7. I pass it
along with no comment...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	By the Washington Post
|
|	ATLANTA -- For now, at least, the Rev. Jerry Falwell has exorcised the
Demon Dialer.
|	But an angry computer commando, as a protest against TV evangelists,
vows to keep right on bedeviling the $100 million fund-raising machine of the
Moral Majority (or the Liberty Federation, as Falwell recently announced his
group will be called) with his $200 Atari home computer.
|	``I'll give you a demonstration,'' said Edward Johnson, 46, a
bespectacled computer consultant, pecking away at a keyboard in his
one-bedroom walk-up apartment here.
|	That activates his modem's auto-dailer. Bleep, bleep, bleep goes the
video arcade echo on his speaker phone as his Atari rings up Falwell's world
headquarters in Lynchburg, Va.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says an operator. ``Can I help you?''
|	Johnson grinned. His computer is programmed to tie up the line for 30
seconds, then it hangs up and dials again, as it has every 30 seconds, 24
hours a day, seven days a week, for the last eight months. ``Here we go
again,'' he said, and the computer dials 
1-800-446-5000
.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says the operator. ``Help you?'' Click.
|	``You can tell by the tone of voice they're not too happy,'' he said.
|	Indeed, Falwell officials estimate their first high-tech protester
cost them close to $1 million in lost pledges on a blessed WATS line, which
fields some 1 million calls a year, before Southern Bell detectives ordered
Johnson to hang up on Dec. 20 or face criminal charges -- using the telephone
to harass is a federal felony. The besieged switchboard raises at least half
of Falwell's $100 million budget, used to support a TV ministry, missionary
work, Bible study, an anti-abortion crusade and the like.
|	``He has robbed the poor and needy of many thousands of dollars,''
said Falwell in a press released that warned others who would do ``injury to
the cause of Christ by similar illegal acts.''
|	But Johnson accuses TV evangelists of persuading elderly viewers to
part with money they can ill afford to spend, buying religious trinkets and
false hope while the on-the-air preachers use their tax-free status to
subsidize and promote often incendiary views.
|	``They're making millions because there aren't any laws to protect the
gullible from such a powerful medium,'' said Johnson, who says he nearly lost
his family farm to TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggert.
|	After one rip-roaring TV sermon, he said, his 68-year-old mother, Mary
Johnson of Sylvester, was ready to sign over the family's 150 acres in south
Georgia. A virtual shut-in, she lives alone on land his father, who died 12
years ago, once planted with soybeans, peanuts and corn. But Johnston stepped
in and, along with an older brother, Raymond, talked her out of it.
|	``She once bought two Singer sewing machines from different salesmen
in the same week,'' he said.
|	Johnson's crusade began one Sunday morning, April 7, when, he
remembers, Jimmy Swaggert on a local affiliate accused gays of ``spreading
AIDS like flies'' at bathhouses.
|	A political activist and card-carrying member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, Johnson got angry. ``He was implying that you should treat
those people like flies,'' he said. He considered it unfair and inflammatory.
And, of course, he almost lost the farm.
|	He wrote the Federal Communications Commission to complain. He tapped
a second computer to mount a letter-writing campaign to congressmen and
senators. And he dispatched copies of those letters to Falwell, who had his
name. But it would take Falwell eight months to unearth Atari Central.
|	He targeted Falwell because he's the ``most politically active'' TV
evangelist, and his mother had sent him hundreds of dollars. ``If we get
Falwell, Swaggart will fall of his own weight,'' said Johnson, who is single
and lives alone.
|	Weaned on old-time religion growing up in Worth County, Ga., he joined
the Air Force out of high school, worked for a large computer firm as an
engineer, then settled into consulting.
|	He has nothing against religion, he says, but he compares his beliefs
more to Spinoza and Einstein than to fundamentalist TV preachers.
|	But what better way to protest than slow down their collection plate,
he argues. So he began dialing 1-800 ...
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' said the operator. ``Tap the phone if you
can hear me, honey. We'll pray for you.''
|	``At first,'' said Johnson, ``they thought I was deaf.''
|	For a time, he tried debating the operators to keep them busy. ``But
it was always, `God bless you,' or `God loves you.' They were so sweet, I kind
of felt sorry for them. They were programmed to be nice.''
|	So it was back to the computer. ``A computer is totally impersonal,''
he said. ``It can't feel sorry for you. It's relentless. It shows no mercy.''
|	Toward the end, operators were answering the dead lines: ``Edward
Johnson, is that you?''
|	They stopped thinking the caller was deaf.
|	``My computer kept the pressure on,'' he said. ``It had a great
demoralizing effect.''
|	On Nov. 15, Falwell officials reported trouble on the line. ``They
came to us with a simple technical problem,'' recalled Wayne Jackson, an AT&T
spokesman. ``They were getting hangups and lines jammed.''
|	Technicians ruled out a glitch and put on a tracer. It was touchy
going. Johnson's Atari was programmed to dial and hang up fast, to avoid
leaving fingerprints. But AT&T got its man.
|	On Dec. 17 ``we figured out it was coming from 404 area code,'' said
Jackson, and officials in Atlanta were alerted. Three days later, Southern
Bell security took over and Johnson was identified as the high priest of the
first church of Atari protest.
|	``It's amazing,'' said Richard Miles, a company spokesman. ``As big as
Atlanta is, within 30 minutes, we had tracked him down.'' The phone company
gave him a choice: stop calling Falwell or lose his telephone. Johnson pulled
his own plug.
|	Will Falwell take the Demon Dialer to court? ``Our attorneys are
considering the options,'' said Duane Ward, his PR director.
|	Before his computer sniping, Johnson protested such local issues as a
road for Jimmy Carter's presidential library that cut through his neighborhood
-- until demonstrators stopped it. From his window, he gazed at idled
earthmovers for inspiration, their cabs spray-painted, ``Long Live the
Trees!''
|	Suddenly Johnson, who once lived a life of quiet resignation, is,
however briefly, a media star. He attributes his inspiration to rage.
|	He says it's not over yet.
|	``I'm encouraging all hackers to reach out and touch Jerry Falwell,''
he said. ``If he's the Moral Majority, this is a good way of taking a vote.''","zx5yshZgQQkJ",1,1986-01-13,-17,13

put up with a remarkably sporadic news feed), but do these calls fit the

they don't, but then I'm frequently wrong.  Anybody here know?

I've fallen into this class.  It's a grey area as to what is harassing,
but it is almost certain that if someone tells you that you are harassing
them, and you continue to do it, that you are harassing them.

Some go there to dance, some to meet people, some, apparently, to drink and
think about dancing.  And some go to watch the other people.  I'm sure there
are other reasons as well.
Problem:  if people go there for all kinds of different reasons, how can
everyone get what they want out of the scene?
Answer from most people (and we hope to get them out of the gene pool):
assume the other person is there for the same reason you are there, and be
obnoxous.
If I went to a singles bar to dance, I wouldn't want to talk.  But if I
went there to meet people, I would.  The main problem is there are those
who go to get laid, and they assume everyone else does as well.  But the
overtly rude behavior that is the only defence against these toadies offends
and hurts the nice people who are simply at cross-purposes.
For this, I recommend that if you want to dance, ask someone to dance, and if
you want to start a conversation, ask if you can join {whomever}.  And don't
be rude, except in self-defence.  And don't think the less of someone who
looks like he/she wants to ask to do either, but does nothing.
Of course, this doesn't cover rude behavior on the dance floor, such as
wandering hands and simply walking off, but toadies will be toadies.  Say this
to yourself three times when it happens, and you'll feel smug, at least.
But don't put up with it.
There are some who feel left out if they don't ask, and guilty if they do.
Why?  They get the impression the askee resents the interruption.

I've said (posted) this before, and I'll say it again.  What's
wrong with going out to get laid?  It's just as valid a goal
as going out to dance or going out to meet people.  The only
problem I can see with it would be dishonesty, i.e.,
don't tell someone you're interested in really getting to know
them if you just want to go to bed with them.
I know this was not meant to be one of Eric's major points,
but I had to react to it because this kind of attitude
seems to come up on the net all the time.
Did I just hallucinate the Sexual Revolution, or did everyone
else just forget it (or worse, believe Time's cover story
that it's over).
Again, sorry Eric.  I don't mean to pick on you in particular.
I'm trying to use your posting to make a larger point.

The problem isn't that they are going out to get laid, the problem
is that they are ASS-U-MEing that everyone else is also out to
get laid.  Can you say ""egocentric""?  Good!
People go to bars for a variety of reasons.  Some go to drink. (Hopefully
these people are taking the bus/cab/etc back home)  Some go to dance.
Some go to play videogames.  Some go to meet people (in general).  Some
are looking for an SO.  Some are looking for a one-night-stand.  Some
are out-of-town with nothing better to do.  Some just tagged along when
the rest of the volleyball team went.  Some go to see the band.  Some go
to 'scope-out the crowd. (people watch)  Some go to sit in front of the
projection TV and laugh at the Cubs.  And so on...
Anyone going to a bar and ASS-U-MEing that anyone else there is there
for anything resembling the same reasons is highly likely to be
dissappointed.

This is a prevalent deception.  Let's face it; the attitude of the
people I am trying to ridicule resembles a Minimax game tree strategy
rather than a human social interaction.  Because of this, these sorts
will follow any behavior they think will achieve the goal.
It would be nice if there was some socially acceptable way that people
who are interested in spending the night with anyone could communicate
this outright, rather than engaging in mating dances of ludicrous
sophistication.  The real purpose of the Sexual Revolution was (I thought)
to allow people to be more honest about their sexual feelings and
desires.  Unfortunately, I don't think it's working.
The only real advantage of this would be that people who want to dance
could dance, people who want to meet people can meet people, and people
who want to satisfy their carnal urges can do that too, all without
social firewalking, deception, hurt feelings, etc, etc, etc.  That is,
without worrying that the person you are talking to now doesn't want
what you want.  Of course, there also has to be a socially acceptable
way of saying either yes or no, to any of the above propositions.
Alas, there is currently no socially acceptable way to communicate *just*
what you want out of the person you are talking to.  And reading body
language and vocal inflections is difficult in a hot, smoky, dark, and
noisy singles' bar.
This doesn't solve the whole problem, of course, but I think it might be
an improvement.  Any better ideas?

I don't think very many people are fooled.  After all,
if you really wanted to get to know someone, why go to a place
which is:
	A)  Too loud to talk.
	B)  Too dark to see.
	C)  Too smokey to smell.
	D)  Too progressive for touch (Lawrence Welk style) dancing.
There is no such thing as instant intimacy.  Sex is no substitute.
On the other hand, it sure makes being lonely a lot more fun.
