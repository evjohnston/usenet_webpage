*Ceremonial Chemistry* by Thomas  Szasz.   The book is published 
by ""Doubleday/Anchor""  Garden City, New York, 1975.    I included his
references.   I have added several items of interest and I have deleted
some things I did not feel were relevant (Szasz documents the parallel
course of relgious history).  All unattributed items (no footnote) 
are from the book.
	Please forgive typos.  It is fairly long and I cannot spend
too much time on it being as I have to earn a living.
	My impression as I collected this and typed it in is that it has
all been done before.   The panic, the draconian solutions, and the ultimate
ineffectuality of the solutions.    Even Russia, the most oppressive state
in history, has considerable drug use.   
	Some of the people that support the war on drugs are acting under
the assumption that laws against drug use somehow restrict their use.
This is absurd.   If we give up rights, like the right to buy anything
we want, the rights are gone.   If there is a good reason, e.g., I am
happy to give up my right to murder people in exchange for not being murdered
myself, it might be worthwhile.   However, history tells us that were to
accept the level of repression and state control that exists in the modern
day USSR, we would still have a drug problem.  All that would have happened
is that we would have given up our other rights.

		characteristic of its effects. . . . It seems to make
		the individual, for the time, a better and greater man. . . .
		The hallucinations, the delirious imaginations of alcoholic
		intoxication, are, in general, quite wanting.  Along

		concluded: ""There is no evidence of any weight regarding the
		mental and moral injuries from the moderate use of these
		drugs. .. . . Moderation does not lead to excess in hemp any
		more than it does in alcohol.   Regular, moderate use of ganja
		or bhang produces the same effects as moderate and regular
		doses of whiskey.""  The commission's proposal to tax bhang
		is never put into effect, in part, perhaps, because one of
		the commissioners, an Indian, cautions that Moslem law and
		Hindu custom forbid ""taxing anything that gives pleasure

		intelligent opinion that habitual and periodic drunkenness
		is often either a symptom or sequel of disease . . . . The

1900		In an address to the Ecumenical Missionary Conference, Rev.
		Wilbur F. Crafts declares: ""No Christian celebration of the
		completion of nineteen Christian centuries has yet been 
		arranged.  Could there be a fitter one than the general 
		adoption, by separate and joint action of the great nations
		of the world, of the new policy of civilization, in which
		Great Britian is leading, the policy of prohibition for the
		native races, in the interest of commerce as well as 
		conscience, since the liquor traffic among child races, 
		even more manifestly than in civilized lands, injures all
		other trades by producing poverty, disease, and death.
		Our object, more profoundly viewed, is to create a more 
		favorable environment for the child races that civilized
		nations are essaying to civilize and Christianize.""

1902		George E. Petty, writing in the *Alabama Medical Journal*,
		observes: ""Many articles have appeared in the medical 
		literature during the last two years lauding this new agent
		. . . .  When we consider the fact that heroin is a morphine
		derivative . . . it does not seem reasonable that such a 
		claim could be well founded.  It is strange that such a claim
		should mislead anyone or that there should be found among
		the members of our profession those who would reiterate 
		and accentuate it without first subjecting it to the most
		critical tests, but such is the fact."" [Quoted in Lennard
		et. al., op. cit. p. 1079]

		he characterizes the Indian peyote religion a ""habit 
		indulgence in certain cactaceous plants,"" calls the belief
		system ""superstition"" and those who sell peyote ""dope vendors,""
		and urges the passage of a bill in Congress that would prohibit
		the use of peyote among the Indian tribes of the Southwest.
		He concludes with this revealing plea for abolition: ""The
		great difficulty in suppressing this habit among the Indians
		arises from the fact that the commercial interests involved
		in the peyote traffic are strongly entrenched, and they 
		exploit the Indian. . . . Added to this is the superstition
		of the Indian who believes in the Peyote Church.  As soon
		as an effort is made to suppress peyote, the cry is raised
		that it is unconstitutional to do so and is an invasion of
		religious liberty.  Suppose the Negros of the South had
		Cocaine Church!"" [Thomas S. Blair, Habit indulgence in

		has been asserted and urged in volumes of 'literature'
		by self-styled 'specialists.'""  [Alfred C Prentice, The
		Problem of the narcotic drug addict, *Journal of the

1925		Robert A. Schless: ""I believe that most drug addiction today

		forbids the sale of narcotics without a physician's 
		prescription. . . . Addicts who are broke act as *agent
		provocateurs* for the peddlers, being rewarded by gifts
		of heroin or credit for supplies.  The Harrison Act made

		than a million lepers among our people.  Think what a shock
		the announcement would produce!  Yet drug addiction is far
		more incurable than leprosy, far more tragic to its victims,
		and is spreading like a moral and physical scourge. . . .
		Most of the daylight robberies, daring holdups, cruel murders
		and similar crimes of violence are now known to be committed
		chiefly by drug addicts, who constitute the primary cause
		of our alarming crime wave.   Drug addiction is more 
		communicable and less curable that leprosy. . . .
		Upon the issue hangs the perpetuation of civilization,
		the destiny of the world, and the future of the human
		race."" [Quoted in Musto, *The American Disease*, p. 191]
1928		It is estimated that in Germany one out of every hundred

		dangerous, habit-forming drugs.  But once the principle
		is admitted that is the duty of government to protect
		the individual against his own foolishness, no serious
		objections can be advanced against further encroachments.
		A good case could be made out in favor of the prohibition
		of alcohol and nicotine.   And why limit the governments
		benevolent providence to the protection of the individual's
		body only?  Is is not the harm a man can inflect on his
		mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily
		evils?  Why not prevent him from reading bad books and
		seeing bad plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues
		and listening to bad music?   The mischief done by bad
		ideologies, surely, is much more pernicious, both for
		the individual and for the whole society, than that 
		done by narcotic drugs."" [Ludwig von Mises, *Human Action*,

     issue of DISCOVER magazine .It is authored by Ms Perri Class ,a fourth
     year medical student at Harvard Medical School.She has described her
     impressions and reactions to a stint of medical training in an alien
     land (in India).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The people look different.The  examining  room  is  crowded  with
children  and  their  parents,gathered  hopefully  around the doctor's
desk,jockeying for position.Everyone seems to  believe,if  the  doctor
gets  close  to  *my*  child  ,everything  will be OK.A small group of
Indian medical students is also present, leaning forward to hear their
profesor's explanations as they watch one particular child walk across
the far end of the room .I stand on my toes,   straining  to  see  the
intervening heads so I,too , can watch this patient walk.I can see her
face,intent, bright  dark  eyes,lips  pinched  in  concentration.She's
about  ten years old.I can see her sleek black head,the two long black
braids pinned up in circles over her ears in the style we used to call
doughnuts.All  she's  wearing is a long loose shirt,so her legs can be
seen,as with great difficulty she  wobbles  across  the  floor.At  the
professor's direction she sits down on the floor and then tries to get
up again;she needs to use her arm to push her body up.
     I'm confused.The patient looks like a child with absolutely clas-
sic  muscular  dystrophy,but  muscular  dystrophy is a genetic disease
carried on the X chromosome,like haemophilia.It  therefore  absolutely
never  occurs  in  girls.Can  this  be  one of those one-in-a-trillion
situations ? Or is it a more unusual form of muscle  disease,one  that
isn't sex-linked in inheritance?
     Finally the child succeeds in getting  up  on  her  feet,and  her
parents  come  forward  to  help  her dress.They pull her over near to
where I'm standing, and as they're helping with the clothing,the  long
shirt  slides  up  over  the  child's hips.No, this isn't one of those
one-in-a-trillion cases.I've been watching a ten-year-old  boy  with
muscular  dystrophy;he  comes  from a Sikh family,and Sikh males don't
cut their hair.Adults wear turbans,but young  boys  often  have  their
hair braided and pinned up in two knots.
     Recently I spent some time in  India,working  in  the  pedriatric
department  of an important New Delhi hospital.I wanted to learn about
medicine outside the U.S., to work in pedriatric clinic in  the  Third
World,and  I suppose I also wanted to test my own medical education,to
find out whether my newly acquired skills are in fact transferable  to
any  place  where  their are human beings,with human bodies,subject to
their range of ills and evils.
     But it wasn't just a question of my medical knowledge.In  India,I
found  that  my  cultural limitations often prevented me from thinking
clearly about patients.Everyone looked different, and I was unable  to
pick  up  any  clues  from their appearance.This is a family of Afghan
Refugees.This family is from south of India.This child is a child from
a  very poor family.This child has a Nepalese name.All the clues I use
at home to help me evaluate patients,clues ranging from what neighbor-
hood they live in to what ethnic origin their names suggest, were hid-
den from me in India.
     The people just don't look different on  the  outside,ofcourse.It
might  be  more  accurate  to say that the population is different.The
gene pool for example:there are some genetic diseases  that  are  much
more common here than there,cystic fibrosis say,which you have to keep
in mind when evaluating patients in Boston,but which  which  would  be
showoffy  and  highly unlikely diagnosis-out-of-the-book for a medical
student to suggest in New Delhi(I know--- in my innocence I  suggested
it).
     And   all   of   this   in   the   end,really   reflects    human
diveresity,though admittedly it's reflected in the strange warped mir-
ror of the medical profession;it's hard to exult  in  the  variety  of
human genetic defects,or even in variety of human culture,when you are
looking at it as a tool for examining a sick child.Still I can  accept
the implications of the world full of different people,different popu-
lations.
     The diseases are different. The  patient  is  seven-year-old  boy
whose  father  says  that  over the past week and a half he has become
progressively more tired,less active ,and lately he  doesn't  seem  to
understand everything going on around him.Courteously, the senior doc-
tor turns to me,asks what my assessment is.He asks this in a tone that
suggests  that  the diagnosis is obvious,and as a guest I'm invited to
pronounce it.The diagnosis,whatever it is, is certainly not obvious to
me.I  can  think of couple of infections that might look like this,but
no single answer.The senior doctor sees my difficulty,  and  offers  a
maxim,one  that  I've heard many times back in Boston.Gently ,slightly
reprovingly he tells me, ""Common things occur commonly. There are many
possibilities,of  course,but  I  think  it  is  safe to say that it is
almost certainly tuberculous meningitis.""
     Tuberculous Meningitis ? Common things occur commonly ? Somewhere
in  my  brain (and somewhere in my lecture notes)""the complications of
tuberculosis"" are filed away and,yes,I suppose it can affect the  cen-
tral  nervous  system,  just  as  I vaguely remember it can affect the
stomach,and the skeletal system...  To tell the truth,I've never  even
seen  a  case  of straightforward tuberculosis of the lungs in a small
child,let alone what I would have thought of as a rare complication.
     And hell,it's worse than that.I've done a fair amount  of  pedia-
trics  back  in Boston,but there are an awful lot of things I've never
seen. When I'm invited to give an opinion on a child's rash,I come  up
with  a  creative  list of tropical diseases,because guess what ? I've
never seen a child with measles before.In the U.S. ,all  children  are
vaccinated  against  measles,mumps,  and  rubella  at  the  age of one
year.There  are  occasional  outbreaks  of   measles   among   college
students,some  of  whom  didn't  get  vaccinated 20 years ago, but the
disease is very rare in small  children.(""Love  this  Harvard  medical
student.   Can't recognize tuberculous meningitis.Can't recognize mea-
sles or mumps.What the hell do you think they teach them over there in
pediatrics?"").
     And this, of course is one of the main  medical  student  reasons
for  going to study abroad,the chance to see diseases you wouldn't see
at home.The pathology ,we call it,as in ""I got  to  see  some  amazing
pathology  while  I  was  in India."" It's embarassing to find yourself
suddenly ignorant,but it is interesting to learn about a new range  of
diagnoses,symptoms,treatments,all  things you might have learnt from a
textbook and then immediately forgotten as totally  outside  your  own
experience.
     The difficult thing  is  that  these  differences  don't  in  any
way,however tortured,reflect the glory of human variation.They reflect
instead the sad partitioning of the species,because they're almost all
preventable  diseases, and their prevalence is a product of poverty,of
lack  of  vaccinations,of   malnutrition   and   poor   sanitation.And
therefore,though  it's  all  very  educational for the medical student
(and I'm by now more or less used to  parasitizing  my  education  off
human  suffering),  this  isn't  a  difference  to be accepted without
outrage.
     The expectations are different.Their child is  a  seven-month-old
girl  with  diarrhea.She  has  been  losing  weight  for  a  couple of
weeeks,she won't eat or  drink,she  just  lies  in  her  grandmother's
arms.The  grandmother explains:one of her other grandchildren has just
died from very severe diarrhea,and this little  girl's  older  brother
died  last  year,not  of diarrhea but of chest infection...  I look at
the grandmother's face,at the face of the bab's mother and  father,who
death,the  chance  that the child will not live to grow up.They've all
seen many children die.These parent's lost a boy  last  year,and  they
know that they may lose their daughter.
     The four have trvelled for almost sixteen hours to come  to  this
hospital,  because  after the son died last year , they no longer have
faith in the village doctor. They are prepared to stay in Delhi  while
she's hospitalised, the  father  and  grandmother may well sleep on the
hospital grounds. They've brought  food  ,cooking  pots,  warm  shawls
because  it's  January  and  it gets cold at night. They're tough, and
they are hopeful, but they believe in the possiblity of death.
     Back home, in Boston, I've heard bewildered parents  say,  essen-
tially,  ""Who would have beleived in 1980s a child could just die like
that ?"". Even parents with terminally ill children, children who spent
months  or years getting sicker and sicker , sometimes have great dif-
ficulty accepting all the art and machinery of modern medicine is com-
pletely helpless. They expect every child to live to grow up.
     In India , it isn't that the parents  are  necessarily  resigned,
and  certainly  not  that they love their children less.  They may not
want to accept the dangers, but poor people,  people  living  in  poor
villages  or in urban slums, know the possiblity is there. If anything
, they may be even more terrified than american parents  just  because
they  are picturing the death of some other loved child,imagining this
living child going the way of that dead one.
     I don't know.This is a gap I can't cross.I can laugh  at  my  own
ability to interpret the signals of a different culture,and I can read
and ask questions and slowly begin to learn a little about the  people
I'm  trying to help care for.  I can blush at my ignorance of diseases
uncommon in my home territory,study up in text books, and deplore ine-
qualities  that  allow  preventable diseases to ravage some unfortunate
populations while others  are  protected.I  can  try  to  become  more
discriminating  in  my  appreciation  of  medical  technology  and its
uses,understanding that the best hospital isn't the one that does  the
most  tests.But  I  can't  draw my lessons from this grandmother,these
parents,this sick little girl .I can't imagine  their  awareness,their
accomodations  of what they know.I can't understand how they live with
it.I can't accept their acceptance.My medical training has taken place
in  a  world where all children are supposed to grow up,and the excep-
tions   to   this   rule   are   rare   horrible   diseases,disastrous
accidents.That   is   the   attitude,the   expectation,I  demand  from
patients.I'm left most disturbed not by the fact of children dying,not
by  the  differences  in  the medical care they receive,but by the way
their parents look at me,at my profession.Perhaps it's  only  in  this
that that I allow myself to take it all personally.

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I read in a recent article on ""Orgasm"" in Discover magazine (or one of
the clones) that the vaginal lubricant produced during arousal in women
is simply 'filtered blood serum' ie, blood cells are removed. This would
probably not remove the virus. How this enters the mans body in

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

My personal feeling is that Burton's recomendation for
study is more viable. Linke's hypothesis is too tenuous
for my way of thinking.

You're sitting in your office, scratching your nasal turbinates with the

""A Mr. Guy LePew to see you Doctor?""
""Send him in!"" you reply and in a matter of moments a short, but muscular
man walks into your office wearing a moustache and carrying a hockey stick.
Suddenly, as the door slams shut behind him, the fellow jumps four feet
into the air and crashes to the floor.
""Excusez-moi monsieur,"" he says as he scrambles to his feet.
""You okay?"" you murmur as you assist the gentleman.
""Oui,oui, eeet eees only zeee scratch,"" he says as he seats himself.

HERE'S THE ANSWER !!!!
	This illness is known as Jumping Frenchman's Disease or the syndrome
of the Jumping Frenchmen of Maine or as Myriachit. This entity was first des-
cribed in 1878 by Dr. George Beard at the 4th Annual Meeting of the American
Neurological Association. He described 50 cases and noted that the disorder
began in childhood, was familial, rarely encountered in females and lasted
through life. It is marked by an exagerated startle response, causing the
sufferer to leap violently into the air at the least noise or surprise.
	These patients also suffer echolalia and the irresistable compulsion
to obey commands even if doing so might be injurious to themselves. ""When
two 'jumpers' were close together and commanded to 'strike,' each struck
the other simultaneously, often severe and painful blows.""
	The disease gets it's name from the fact that the first victims
were often French-Canadians or residents of Maine. The term Myriachit
comes from the Russian ""to act foolishly"" and basically connotes a similar
syndrome which they of course claim to have discovered first. At any rate,
though a rare entity, cases of this syndrome do occasionally crop up and
have been described in the literature as recently as 1967.(*) For more on this
strange illness, see V.42 of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology, p.231

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become 
	increasingly well defined; they include homosexual and

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to
the Press conference AND all three patients died in the week following.

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

This has been checked out by the CDC, and apparently there is no risk 
for transmission of HTLV-III via an insect vector.  I'm not sure of the
reference, but I think it's a recent issue of JAMA, in the ""Leads from the
MMWR"" section.
By the way, the virus is inactivated by high and low pH and by exposure to a
temperature of 56 C for ten minutes.  Most standard disinfectants (Lysol,
Clorox) and halogenated hand soaps will also inactivate the virus.

Lupus, more properly known as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE), is a disease
affecting the autoimmune system of the body, often affecting the
connective tissue of the body.  Manifestations of lupus are many, varied,
and often dificult to diagnose.  SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune
collagen vascular disease, and can present itself in many varied forms
throughout any system in the body. A person may be plagued for many years
before a diagnosis is confirmed.  Most of the symptoms end with the suffix
 -itis, giving a key to the pathology seen in the illness - inflammation.
Clinically distressing symptoms of heat, swelling, pain and local tissue
damage accompany inflamation is the normal immune response.  The abnormnal
autoimmune response of SLE produces the same inflamation with the 
accompanying distressing symptoms in a bizarre chronic fluctuating fashion,
affecting different sites at random for no known reason. The vasculitus
or inflamation of the veins and arteries seen in SLE in the heart, lungs,
swollen joints, skin, kidneys, or any other area of the body is caused
by clusters of antigens and antibodies (immune complexes) in combat. This
inflammation results in blockage, scarring, and damage of the small
blood vessels in these organs.  
Earlier, because of inadeguate testing methods, lupus was believed to be
rare, affecting only a small percentage of the population.  In reality,
earlier diagnostic methods underreported the number of patients affected
by lupus.  With newer testing techniques, lupus has been diagnosed in 
1 out of 2,000 in the general population, 1 out of 750 in Caucasian women,
and 1 out of 250 in black women.  Women in their child bearing years are 
statistically more prone to developing lupus. It now affects an estimated
500,000 people in the U.S., and 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.
There are an estimated 5,000 deaths annualy from SLE. It is more common
than Muscular Distrophy, cystic fibrosis, MS, and leukemia.
Lupus in many cases manifests itself by the appearance of a blotchy
""butterfly"" shaped rash across the face and bridge of the nose, or rashes
appearing elsewhere on the body.  This common dermatologic symptom
was considered to be a ""trademark"" of the earlier diagnostic methods,
while it is now known that one may develop lupus with no visible
dermatologic symptoms. Nevertheless, most lupus patients are advised
to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, to wear wide brim hats, long sleeve
shirts, sunscreens, etc., while outdoors.  It appears the exposure to certain UV
light may ""trigger"" an recurrance of certain more serious symptoms in certain
lupus patients. Many patients display the skin involvement only, and are
refered to as discoid lupus as opposed to systemic.
Each patient manifests SLE in an individual manner with no typical predictable
course or prognosis. The fluctuations are refered to as flares and remissions.
A well managed patient can remain in a remissive state for quite a while, and
then suffer an unexplained flare-up at any time. Factors causing flareups
are thought to be many, including emotional stress, infections, physical stress,
UV light, operations, pregnancy, sudden decrease of lupus medications, extreme
heat/cold, injuries, overwork, insufficient rest, allergies, poor living habits,
certain drugs, etc.
Remission does not mean that the patient is symptom free. Instead thru various
treatment methods, the patient learns to cope.  A signifigant side effect
is often depression or other emotional reactions expressing a sense of 
helplessness on the part of the patient, partly because on its chronic
nature, lack of specific prognosis, and its difficulty in explaining
to others why sometimes you feel OK, and othertimes you feel lousy. 
A key to adjustment and management is the support of friends and family
members, and joining one of many  lupus support groups where one can
compare notes, discover that ""no, you aren't the only one that has it,"" 
and learn from guests and featured speakers what progress medical research
is making in finding a cause, cure, or improved tratment or diagnosis.
(Note: Sorry to be so long winded, but a close friend has been diagnosed as
having it. Things were rough for a while, but she's doing well and has
pretty much the same lifestyle as before - except no more tans at the
beach! BTW, I am by no means an MD. Most of the above was either
paraphrased or plagiarized from the Lupus Foundation of America/North
Carolina Lupus Foundation, Inc., Winston-Salem Lupus Chapter monthly

Lupus is the name generally used for the colagen disease Lupus Erythematosis.
In brief, this is an immunologic-type disorder affecting multiple organ
systems and showing a variety of signs and symptoms.
In terms of testing, it occassionally may lead to a presumptive diagnosis of
CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia), but finding the typical LE cell usually
is one way of determining the difference.  Also, tests for anti-nuclear 
antibodies are commonly positive with Lupus, but also, sometimes, with the 
other collagen diseases.  It is essentially an autoimmune disease targetted
at DNA.
Hope this helps. (My memory of the specifics of LE seemed to be coming in
short bursts; sorry for the disorganized ramblings!)","udHPRDg-vU8J",10,1985-11-08,-2,8

Boy, can I tell you about Lupus. (:-) Lupus is the common name for Systemic
Lupus Erythmatosis. It is an autoimmune disease, considered to be part of the
arthritis family. There is no specific known cause (yet), but it is believed to
be linked to sun exposure, possibly allergies, and probably a genetic pre-
disposition toward it. There are many early symptoms. Some of these include
a rash on the face (usually shaped like a butterfly- imagine your nose as the 
body, and a wing on each cheek- mine makes me look like a racoon), general
tiredness and/or malaise, pain in the joints, angina-like pain in the chest,
a (possibly) raised rash on the chest, back, or arms after sun exposure. It
can be diagnosed by a few blood tests (an LE-prep, anti-dna antibody, ana, and
a host of others).  Treatment depends on the physician, and your particular
disease. It acts differently in each case (making it difficult to diagnose, 
and later treat.) Generally, an initial treatment of NSAIDS (non-steriodal
anti-inflammitory drugs), such as Clinoril, asprin, Feldene, and such is the
first line of attack. If this doesn't work, then steriods (such as Prednisone)
are tried. They are useful in knocking down a flare of the disease, but have
HORRIBLE side effects. But, the side effects beat dying. Other new treatments
include blood filtering (I forget the exact name of the procedure right now), 
immunosuppresents (such as those used in organ transplants), and chemotherapy
(Cytoxin, etc.) These last treatments are generally a last ditch effort, and 
should be approached with caution. 
As for the disease itself, autoimmune means ""allergic to self."" Your antibodies
become confused as to what is a foreign cell, and what is a 'homebody' (ie-
you!) The weakest points are attacked first- generally the joints. This produces
a non-deforming form of arthritis. Other favorite areas of attack are the lining
of the heart and lungs, which produces an angina-like pain in the chest. The
kidneys are also a vulnerable area, with nephritis being one of the more serious
complications of the disease.  Liver damage is also possible.  Up to 10 years
ago, a patient was usually given about 3 years to live. Now, with proper
treatment, there is no reason that the lifespan should be shortened, barring 
major complications. There is some connection between UltraViolet light (the
sun being a primary source) and the triggering of the disease.  Most (but not
all) Lupins have a sun sensitivity to some degree. But with the appropriate
paraphenalia (#22 SPF sunscreen, floppy hat, long sleeve shirt, umbrella, pup
tent...) you can make brief outings to the great outdoors. Most (~90%) of the
persons struck by Lupus are women.  
Lupus can certainly complicate your life, and be a real pain in the wherever
a lot of the time. But it is not generally fatal, and gives you a real empathy
with what older folks are going through. If you have it, or know someone who
does, have them contact their local chapter of the Arthritis Foundation for
more complete information. I am also available through email for any questions
you may have. (Don't expect a reply until after Dec 9- I'm going on a honeymoon
trip to New Zealand, starting tomorrow 11/12.)

When I was still in college (turn of the century, I think |-) ) my
law prof. brought up a topic for discussion and I want to do it

Why do you -as a patient- have to be required to seek services from
a doctor who had to get licensed by the state.
Think about it---
If I wanted to entrust my broken arm to you, and you were willing
to accept the job of fixing it but didn't have a piece of paper,
so what? If I have faith in you why can't I let you do it? If you

You are assuming that the person you entrust your care to has not misrepresented
his abilities as a healer.  The point is that a large amount of damage may be
done by someone who is misrepresenting him/herself to a small, but nonetheless
gullible segment of society.  Also remember that how gullible a potential
victim is depends on how fast a talker the ""healer"" in question is.  Although
the number of charlatans at large may be small, the potential damage that they
can cause is large, hence the requirement of licensure for the physician.
Remember - I'm not arguing for taking away the right of an INFORMED consumer
of health care to go to who they want, but I think the potential for abuse of
an UNINFORMED consumer makes licensure necessary.

	It is not illegal to seek medical care from a non-licensed ""healer"".
It is only illegal to offer to GIVE medical care without benefit of a license.
	The question I have is 'Why would you even WANT to entrust your broken
arm to an unlicensed practitioner?'  Without even being a board certified
Orthopedist, I can think of at least a dozen complications of a broken arm
that could cripple one for life or even kill. A license is just a form of
consumer protection, nothing more.

Sorry Craig, you missed my point.           
First---What about the Good Samaritan Law in regards to accidents. A person
        is offering to GIVE medical care. Is that person breaking the law?
        If so why do they do it and run the risk of lawsuits?
Second--It is not whether I WANT to, but WHY CAN'T I? I agree it is not a

In some instances, across the country, the unlicensed practice can be a
felony.  There have even been felonious instances by a licensed doctor.

The Good Samaritan Law was passed to prevent the increasingly common occurence
of normal people, say giving someone CPR, and then getting sued for breaking
a few ribs.  Based on that information, the logic fails.
	Besides, the good samaritan is offering to give First Aid, not
comprehensive medical care.  But the fact that they had to pass the good
samaritan laws proved that at least some lawyers found it profitable to argue
that yes, they were breaking the law. (I don't agree, and I also believe in
altruism as a motive.)

	Didn't you read what I said. It's not illegal at all.  I even kept the
line in above [ if you can go back a screenful]
	It may be legal, but it sure ain't smart -- especially for the example
chosen (broken bone).

The distinction between LICENSING and CERTIFICATION is a legal
one having little to do with the degree of preparation or skill.
A license gives you the right to do something that would be a crime
for the un-licenced to do.  A certification gives you the right to
do something and claim exceptional expertise at doing it when
others are allowed to do it, but are not allowed to
claim exceptional expertise at doing it.  There may also be
some limitations on the ability of the un-certificated to practice
in some situations.
In the area of medicine, to offer treatment without a licence
is a crime.  Under certification, it would not be a crime; though
taking the offer might be stupid ... :-)
While it is usually the case that both licensing and certification
require some formal training and/or examination; the distinction
between them rests on the penalty for practice when not blessed
by having the paper.  Physicians are licenced, not certified.

Perhaps this is a little off the subject, but have you ever heard

Not knowing what `inspire' means, and only having a shitty dictionary at
hand, I can only guess that the definition you're using is either
   a) ""stimulate to activity"" -- sad but true, or
   b) ""inhale"" (or maybe ingest in some other fashion)
Anyway, could you (or someone) elaborate on ways in which AIDS is acquired
from women?
Also, I just realized that I know that AIDS can be transmitted
via semen or blood, but I don't know how such fluids must contact or
be ingested by the recipient.  For example, I would guess that AIDS
could be transmitted in menstrual fluids (can it also be found in
non-blood vaginal secretions?), but I don't know if it can be
transmitted to a person by bodily contact, or by oral sex.

	""After about a year of follow-up [of radial keratotomy or
pinwheel surgery for near-sightedness], results of this operation
gave grounds for guarded optimism, with about 80% of patients
achieving nearly normal vision without glasses.  But as we stressed
then, what really counts is the long-term benefit of such surgery.
Last June, the results of a 4-year follow-up appeared in the
Archives of Ophthalmology, and they shift our position toward
guarded pessimism.  Between 1 and 4 years after the operation,
only 6% of the treated eyes retained the correction achieved by the
operation.  About 20% had shifted back toward nearsightedness,
and over 70% had tended to become more farsighted.  The drift
away from normal vision was regarded as significant (enough to
require correction with lenses) in about one-third of the patients.
Surgical techniques have changed since this group of operations
was performed.  Carbon-steel blades have been replaced by diamond
blades, and other aspects of diagnosis and treatment have presumably
been improved.  Even so, the basic message of the current study
is an important one:  good results after one year won't necessarily
last a lifetime.  Until we have hard facts about the long-term

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the

is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

AIDS:  Casual contact exonerated
--------------------------------
    Research findings on AIDS at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Minneapolis this week covered the gamut from
good to bad to surprising.  The good news:  The syndrome is apparently not
transmitted through casual household contact and hence not among school
children; health care workers who handle AIDS patients, even workers who have
accidentally stuck themselves with needles, have little if any chance of
becoming infected, according to researchers.
    The bad news:  Heterosexual transmission, at least in Haiti and Africa, is
becoming increasingly prevalent.  And the surprising news:  The virus
associated with the disease may have been around as long ago as 1962.
    A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study of 101 members of households that
included an AIDS sufferer shows transfer of infection only in one instance, in
a baby born to an infected mother.  ""From this study,"" says Martha F. Rogers of
the CDC in Atlanta, who headed the study, ""our best estimate of the risk of
household transmission is zero.""  The belief that AIDS victims in schools can
transmit the disease, she says, has no scientific basis in the data collected
thus far.
    Three studies presented at the meeting show little if any risk to health
care workers involved with AIDS patients.  In a CDC study of 802 workers
nationwide who had been exposed to AIDS blood or body fluids, only one person
with no other risk factors was infected with the virus; of 527 health care
workers in two prospective studies, only 1 of 95 workers who had accidentally
stuck themselves with a needle, showd evidence of exposure.  The incidence
might be so low because it takes repeated exposures or an overworked immune
system to allow the virus to establish itself, researchers suggested.
    Heterosexual transmission is establishing itself as a mode of infection in
Haiti and Africa.  In Haiti, 14 percent of AIDS victims in a 1980-1982 survey
were women; thus far in 1985, 36 percent are women, reports Warren D. Johnson
Jr., of Cornell Medical College in New York City.  When the researchers
questioned AIDS patients about recent deaths of spouses, they found 5 percent
had spouses who died of confirmed AIDS and another 15 percent had died of what
seemed to be AIDS.
    A study in Kenya, which has not reported a high AIDS incidence, shows the
virus is establishing itself among prostitutes at an alarming rate.  Of 64
women who served a ""lower class"" clientele, 42 had AIDS antibodies, while 8 of
26 with a ""higher class"" clientele had antibodies; no overt disease has yet
been seen.
    Where the virus comes from remains to be solved, but a report at the
meeting may add 10 years to its age.  J.A. Epstein and colleagues at the Food
and Drug Administration reported finding AIDS-specific antibodies in two of 544
blood samples collected in Upper Volta in 1963--10 years earlier than
previously reported Ugandan samples (SN:3/16/86,p.173).  Whether this means the
AIDS virus itself was present, or just a similar virus, remains to be seen,
Epstein says.                                                    --J. Silberner

So, don't bite people!  Don't associate with biters.  But don't use this as a
reason to bar non-biters from school.  In my whole school career, I found it
necessary to bite one person -- a teacher who hit first.
If a person at school bites, send the idiot home!  Not because he/she
has/doesn't have AIDS. but because biting is not a useful educational 
activity.

feel that there is much more danger to the child with AIDS

a child having AIDS attending school, there is a much
greater risk of the child catching what would normally
be a simple childhood disease and not being able to
fight it off.  Take chicken pox as an example.  There once
was a tribe of indians living in the area of northern Iowa
that was wiped out after coming in contact with chicken pox.
The same thing happened in the area of Easter Island some
200 years ago.  So, since chicken pox can kill those
without an immunity, the child with AIDS will have the
same problem.  I feel that putting the child into this
environment would be a greater risk to the child than
that supposed risk to those around the child.  Shoving
a child into the school based on principles is not helping
the child or solving the problem.  It is mearly satisfying
the egos of some folks who have no real compassion for

survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.
I understand your position, but dissagree.  I assume you feel the same.

may be controversial because non-combat personnel and civilian employees
don't  expect  exposure  to  combat conditions (and possible exposure to

unit for verification.
    ALL  army  personnel  are  considered  deployable  in  case of need.
Personnel with non-combat MOSs (presently includes all women, by act  of
Congress)  may  still  face combat situations.  Example; transport.  All
army  personnel  get  basic  training  involving   weapons   usage   and
hand-to-hand  combat.   They are not expected to lose those skills.  All
army personnel may be called upon to donate blood  for  transfusions  in
combat situations.  
    (I don't know what conditions pertain  to  civilian  employees,  but
suspect  they  too  may  be  called  upon  to  donate  blood  in case of
emergency.)
    That seems to make  sense,  both  from  the  viewpoint  of  military
effectiveness  and  the  utility of HLTV-III screening for new recruits.
Also for future testing of present military personnel.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

by semen has been only circumstantial, although fairly strong (its spread by
sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.

phenomena are explained by that theory.  In my >25 years of practicing
and teaching medicine I have seen no approach that explains the
observed, or gets the results, 1/4th as well as the holistic paradigm.
Eventually the truth will out.  This theory has been advanced several
times this century, by many prominent practitioners of medicine.
However, because we still didn't have the technology, or sufficiently
advanced knowledge and methods of communicating that knowledge, the

AIDS is doing us a favor:  It is finally serious enough to get the
attention of the majority of the people.  You know, an organism is a
perfect microcosm of the population of a country:  Until anough of the
cells of your body shout for attention (a measure of how sick you
are), you are not likely to change what you are doing.  Until enough
of the people in this country (both lay and professional) hurt anough
to understand enough we will keep on in the same direction we have
been going.
Fortunately, the environment, both physical and psychological, is not
going to let us get away with the wrong direction much longer.
Legionaire's Disease was not a loud enough warning.  So, we got Toxic
Shock.  When that wasn't enough, we got Reye's Syndrome, Kawasaki
Syndrome, MacDonald's Hemorrhagic Colitis, Post Polio
Syndrome-----AIDS--; we almost have the ""new disease of the month"".
ALL of these disorders are caused by the same basic problem I
described in net.med 817: AIDS IS PREVENTABLE.
We deserve better than we are presently getting from those we have
entrusted with the ""disease care system"" of this country.  It is about
time we start looking to the TRUE ""health care professionals""
presently trying to get the attention of the government and the
public.  They are the HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSN. and other Holistic
medical practitioners.  The longer it takes the more people will
suffer and the more it will cost.

his article.

Was it published? References, please?
BTW, what is the relation between the International Academy of
Preventive Medicine and main-stream M.D.-type medicine? (A
question for both Mr. (Dr?) Stoll and mainstream M.D.'s.
>In the beginning a few
>conventional researchers dared to suggest the truth but no one really
>liked the idea because ... it didn't fit the conventional

sentences.]
The idea, that AIDS requires a breakdown of the immune system
after prolonged stress, reminds me of the work of Hans Selye.
I had the impression he was respected by main-stream medicine.
If this is the case, is it consistent with supposing that
main-stream medicine pooh-poohed the Holists' view of AIDS?
>A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in

References, please?  AND critical treatment of these issues:
(a) What is your universal quantitative measurement of the
severity of a ""stress"", and how is this measurement justified?
(b) How did the West Germans measure the stresses that people
were subjected to 100 years ago, and how were these stresses
quantitatively compared to those of today?
Consider the environmental stresses that people faced 100
years ago, in comparison with those of today.  Driving is
stressful; but being limited to the speed of a horse and buggy
( ~ 4 miles per hour) must have been frustrating and therefore
stressful as well.  Which is better?  Well, which have you chosen
for yourself?
Then there were the nutritional stresses... no fresh green
veggies in winter, no refrigeration in summer, food preserved
by smoking or salting it... (too much salt in the diet, not to
mention carcinogens galore)... Somewhere I read once that in
the early 1800's, English bakers frequently put alum in their
bread to whiten it. (Cross reference discussion of aluminum
and Alzheimer's Disease.) A consequence was kidney/bladder
stones; Eton's infirmary had a ward for boys with bladder
stones.
This is getting far afield of AIDS; but it makes me feel
uncertain that, where holistic medicine is valid, it is all
that far from main-line M.D. medicine.

propose THE solution to difficult problems, and the perversion of
incomplete scientific evidence into a grand theory fully of fanciful
embellishments but truly lacking in any kind of scientific basis, let alone
scientific proof.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT PEOPLE WITH ""HEALTHY"" IMMUNE SYSTEMS
ARE SOMEHOW PROTECTED FROM CONTRACTING AIDS.  One might as well make the
same kind of tautological statement about disease in general, and it would
still lack any predictive value for the individual.  Yeah, AIDS is
preventable: to be 100% safe, don't have sex outside of a monogamous
relationship which has remained monogamous for the past 5 years.  The next
best thing is to avoid exchanging bodily fluids with strangers.  Any
""vigorously healthy"" or even ""average"" person would have to be out of his
mind to think that his presumably healthy immune system is immune to
getting AIDS: there are too many ""vigorously healthy"" people who are now
seriously ill or dead.  In many cases, it only took a single infected sex
partner.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

Study: AIDS Robs Cells Of ""Recognition"" Ability by Richard Saltus
===============================================
[Following close on the heels of another major discovery* :]
	The first step in the destruction of the immune system by the
AIDS virus is a preemptive attack on the ability of key immune cells
to recognize foreign organisms, a study shows.
	The virus acts with such precision that the immune system is 
utterly unable to mount a response, even though the capacity to
counterattack still exists, government researchers said.
	Thereafter, normal immune competence collapses and the victim
is left prey to a wide range of infections and tumors that cause the
syndrome's high mortality.
	The report in today's New England Journal of Medicine adds to
the growing evidence on how the AIDS virus - known as HTLV-III or LAV
[or ARV] - destroys the very defenses designed to disable it.
	The virus' name, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, signifies that it
attacks T cells, the white blood cells that orchestrate the complex
response of the immune system.  The T cells recruit other cells into
the fight, cause the release of certain antiinfection substances and
stimulate B cells to produce antibodies.
	AIDS victims have a drastically reduced force of ""helper"" T
cells, called T4, compared to the number of ""suppressor"" or T8 cells.
What has not been clear is whether the low number of T4 cells or some
inherent defect in the T4 cells is responsible for the progressive
failure of the immune system.
Resistance Tested
	Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases studied blood from 12 AIDS patients, challenging the immune
cells with substances that should cause the T4 cells to proliferate
rapidly.  In this test the T4 cells were not required to recognize a
foreign substance.  The cells responded normally, showing that they
retained the capacity to mount resistance to infection.
	Then the scientists mixed the blood with a foreign antigen,
a protein of the sort that the immune system would encounter should
the body be infected by an invading organism.
	This time there was no response.  To the researchers this
suggested that the T4 cells, which are equipped to distinguish what
is foreign from what is ""self,"" had lost that ability.
	Dr. H. Clifford Lane, who directed the research, said that the
infecting AIDS virus has been shown to attach itself to the T4 receptor,
a molecule on the surface of the T4 cell.  In effect, the virus blinds
the cell to foreign antigens.
	Lane said it was impossible to be certain whether the virus
uniformly knocks out the surface molecule on otherwise intact T4 cells,
or perhaps kills off a subpopulation of T4 cells that has the recognition
site.
	In any case, ""It's a very smart virus that came up with that way
of attacking the immune system,"" sad Lane.  He noted that these events 
occur early in the disease, leading to a cascade of later abnormalities as 
the immune system is devastated.
No New Therapies Implied
	Lane, in a telephone interview, said that the discovery does not
yet suggest any new therapies for the syndrome, but that it ""gives us a
better appreciation of how the AIDS virus is attacking and destroying the
immune system.""
	In an accompanying editorial, two Harvard scientists said that
increasing knowledge about the affinity of HTLV-III/LAV for the T4 cells
is helping to explain many of the puzzling aspects of the lethal syndrome
- and is raising some concerns.
	For one thing, said Drs. Richard S. Kalish and Stuart F. Schlossman,
when T4 cells multiply to fend off some other infection, they probably
become more vulnerable targets to infection by the AIDS virus.
	This may explain, they said, why exposure to the AIDS virus is less
likely to produce the syndrome in the absence of another infection, as in
people receiving tainted transfusions and health workers exposed to HTLV-III.
	However, the Harvard researchers also raised the possibility that,
in certain cases, the virus can infect not only T cells but also B cells.
""Such virally infected cells may function as a reservoir of virus,
potentially thwarting attempts at reconstitution of the immune system,""
they wrote.
	While there is still no effective treatment for AIDS, Schlossman
said in an interview, ""We've learned a great deal about the disease, and
the future is not so bleak as one might think.""
	*****************************************************
* In late June the discovery of a gene on HTLV-III which regulates
 the rate of growth of the virus was announced.  HTLV-III displays
 explosive growth at a rate up to 1,000 times as great as, eg, HTLV-I
 which is known to cause various cancers.  Manipulation of this gene
 suggests not only possibilities for eventual vaccine production but 
 even for the treatment of people already infected with the virus.
So, folks, it probably pays to keep up your general health, to avoid
other infections so as to deny the AIDS virus possible footholds in 
your bodies.

	For this, I looked in the AMA Drug Evaluations.  Two other places
that could be consulted are the PDR (Physician's Desk Reference) and
the Merck Index.  ALSO (and I was privately chastised for not mentioning
this more often),  call up your Doctor - for one, he has your history and
he knows your dosage.
	Thiazide-type diuretics block the reabsorbtion of Sodium, and the
water follows the Sodium out of the body.  They interfere with the 
production of dilute urine.
	Side effects: Pottasium may also be lost (see below). Also, the body
may respond to the loss of water, which has the effect of causing more
potassium to be lost, along with hydrogen ion and chloride ion. These have
certain effects of their own, which would be too technical for me to discuss.
	If you are worried about this, discuss the possibility of a 
Potassium sparing diuretic in addition to Thiazide. (I know nothing about
this particular facet, and I'm sure it's different for each patient.)
> 2. I have heard it rumored that there has been a study showing INCREASED
   > heart disease amoung hypertensives treated with diuretics as compared
   > with untreated hypertensives. Is this only a rumor or is it true?
	The study you are referring to is MRFIT (Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial) and it was discussed in this newgroup several months
ago.  It is probably one of the most misrepresented studies of all time.
	It was set up like this: about 13,000 people with one of three
risks for heart disease (high BP, smoker, of High Cholesterol) were
placed in one of two groups: SI - Special Intervention, or UC - Usual
Care (i.e., ""You have high BP. Go see your doctor."")
	Both groups had lower mortality.  (R.J. Reynolds the tobacco maker
said it was because smoking didn't matter all that much -- the truth was
that even in UC, doctors told their patients to quit smoking, and they
did almost as often as those in the SI group.)  In fact, in many cases,
the UC group did as well as the SI group.  (This attests not so much to
the uselessness of the special intervention, as the quality of care
designated as 'Usual.')
As a whole, the Special Intervention did better than the usual care group.
(about 20-30% lower death rate)  However, in certain cases, the UC group 
did better than the SI group.  Or, put another way, the special group did worse.
	This one group of patients was, those with 1) high blood pressure,
AND 2) abnormal EKGs (indicative of heart muscle/electrical trouble).
	The reason was that this group was more likely to be put on diuretics,
which may lower serum POTASSIUM.  Abnormal potassium levels cause electrical
problems in nerves and muscles, and these people sufferred more heart attacks.
(Of course, this is now known because of MRFIT, and doctors look out for
this kind of thing.)
	Reference for this:
	Clinical Trials, Diuretics, and the Management of Mild Hypertension
	Marvin Moser, MD
	Archives of Internal Medicine -- Vol 144, April 1984, pp. 789-793.
	Note however, that MRFIT only concerned itself with moderate
hypertension - a pretreated diastole between 90 - 104. There is absolutely
no ambiguity concerning getting a higher blood pressure at least into that
range - lowering it is beneficial.

	I'm sure there is something much more substantial than this, but
many people who are overweight and hypertensive, see their blood pressure
drop to normal when they lose the weight.  That is indirect evidence that
nutrition plays a role. 
	There is supposedly some evidence that a diet high in fiber may 
help, possibly by changing the rate of absorbtion of ions from the gut.
However, I can provide no reference, and unless I can get confirmation (or
refutation) on this one, I'll have to consider it hearsay.
	I have also seen or heard about some suggestive but inconclusive
studies that not only HIGH Sodium, but also LOW Potassium and Calcium can
contribute to high BP. There was even some talk that Chloride -- the OTHER
ion in Salt (Sodium Chloride) may contribute, but Sodium is the biggie.

	Hypertension is found in all segments of the population. Blacks are
more prone than whites, males more than females. One sees it more in people
who are overweight, out-of-shape, who smoke, etc...
	As for the individual case, that is for you and your doctor to
work out.
	And if anyone on the net doesn't know their blood pressure, take
steps to get it taken.  Hypertension has no symptoms much of the time.

	You may have seen the article I posted a month ago, where researchers
evaluating biofeedback, meditation, and several other methods for lowering
blood pressure, ""lied"" to a control group, telling them that just taking
their own blood pressure several times a day would make it go down. They
were quite suprised when it actually did -- better than all the other
methods.  (Well, consider it another form of biofeedback.)

The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

Furthermore, since when does 'monogamy' mean 'one woman'. It is not USED
that way and its dictionary definition is not even that. I think you
are confusing it with 'monogyny'.
monogyny	the having of one female spouse at the same time
monoandry	the having of one male spouse at the same time

	HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen,  although they are a group
of proteins that occur on every cell in the body.  There are 4 groups -
HLA-A,B,C are found on every cell.  HLA-D is particularly prominent on
White Blood Cells.  There are hundreds of types of each letter - so many
in fact, that probably no two people on Earth (except identical twins)
have the same arrangement.  HLAs are also known as Transplantation antigens
-- they are the cause of Rejection following Heart/Kidney/etc. transplant.
	One of them -  HLA-D4 has been shown to react with the antibody to
the virus that presumably causes AIDS.  This is the first case of a true
False Positive with known cause.
	Therefore, people who carry the HLA-D4 gene will register a positive
result to the AIDS blood test, whether or not they have been exposed to the
AIDS virus.  However, it can be checked via other means.
	One explanation for the phenomenon is that the only cell line in
which HTLV-3 will grow carries the HLA-D4, and hence the antibody is raised
to a HLA-D4/HTLV-3 hybrid (also known as a virally-altered self) and then
will react with each component separately.

	The Test checks for antibodies against HTLV3, also known as

	The article described the testing of anti-HLA antibodies (which are
normally used in tissue typing for transplants) and the discovery that one,
anti-HLA-DR4, reacted with anti-AIDS antibodies.
	I left out the 'anti's last time and here's where I made the boo-boo.
People who have the HLA-DR4 gene will not test false positive for HTLV3.
For them to have anti-DR4 antibodies would mean that they would be attacking
their own tissues.
	The only way someone would have those antibodies was if they had 
recieved a transfusion or a transplant or a skin graft from someone who

Try the Physician's Desk Reference--any library should have it.
I would love to tell you my horror story of a drug allergy (:-),
but would need more details to know if it applies to you.
You mention the name of the drug, but what sort of drug is it?
The reason I ask is that I had a bad reaction to a sulfa drug.
I do not remember which it was, but it means that I must avoid ALL
sulfa drugs.  Is the one you mention of that sort?  Why were
you taking it?  What was the reaction?
I will mention that I now always look any prescription drug up
in the PDR to find out what the possible side effects are.  If
I had done that with that sulfa drug I could have saved myself
LOTS OF AGONY.  The doctor did not look it up either, and continued
the treatment, assuming I had a virus.  Always know what you are

From American Medical News, May 3, 1985, published by the AMA
page 1, 35.
	Anti-AIDS drugs promising.
	Intensive research over the past year has produced at least six
drugs that show early promise in treating acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS).
	These drugs are significant because they attack the virus itself,
rather than merely treating the infections and malignancies associated with
the disease.  Five drugs are now being tested in AIDS patients, the sixth is
undergoing in-vitro study.
	Each of the agents acts by interfering with the replication of the
AIDS-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV.
[]
	The most promising drugs are:
1. Suramin. Commonly used to treat sleeping sickness. It is thought to block the
cytopathic effect of the virus.  Although it can produce severe toxicity in
Africans with parasitic disease, it appears well tolerated in US AIDS patients.
2. HPA-23.  This drug also is an inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
Tested at the Pastuer Institute in France, two of four AIDS patients show no
sign of virus one month after receiving the drug.
3. Phosponoformate.  MGH researchers have shown this drug has persistent
anti-viral action ... Two Swedish patients now are receiving the drug.
4. Ribavirin. This decade old drug, believed to act as a nucleotide analog,
appears to inhibit HTLV-III replication in cultured cells. It's exact 
mechanism action remains unknown.
5. Alpha Interferon.  This has previously been shown to be effective against
Herpes Zoster, CMV, and influenza.  It is furthest along in clinical testing.
Stage 2 and 3 trials are planned in Boston, Seattle, and New York.
6. Amsanycin. In CDC in-vitro trials, this drug reduces infective virus by
90%. It is the least studied of the anti-AIDS drugs, and its mechanism remains
unclear.
No single ""magic bullet"" drug stands out as the answer to the AIDS epidemic.
Because they act on different sites, it may be best to use them simultaneously
or in sequence. There could be an additive, even synergistic, effect.
[Editor's Comment: The above, while edited, contains none of my own prose.
Therefore, I'd appreciate no flames, thank you.]

It is a very very far cry from noting that nonoxynol-9 inactivates

during sex.  We simply DON'T KNOW what kind of effect it may have
on the spread of AIDS--it might as easily facilitate its spread through
some bizarre surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  People who use
an agent like this as an excuse to return to dangerous sex practices
are being deceived in the worst way, and it seems to me that the Mariposa
Foundation and other promoters of nonoxynol-9 should be on hand to sign

	AP) The Government has approved a sec-
	ond screening test for blood contam-
	inated by acquired immune deficiency
	syndrome, or AIDS, after laboratory
	results indicating it was the most sens-
	itive indicator of possible exposure to
	the disorder.
 	  Electro-Nucleonics Inc. of Fairfield,
	N.J., was awarded the second license by
	the FDA ....
About 2 months ago, I ran a series of four articles on HTLV-3, the virus
that most likely causes AIDS. I spoke of the screening test as highly
accurate, and then received mail and flames otherwise.
	Well, here is the source of the misunderstanding. There are several
tests - the most sensitive being the Western blot, which I was referring to.
(This was reasonable, since most Test-Positive results were to be redone
with Western blots before accepting the results.) It has an accuracy of
99.8% or so.
	The first licensed test had an accuracy of approx. 93%. Tests under
development range from 82-95.6%.  These all use a system called ELISA (for
Enzyme-linked Immuno- S? Assay) which is much easier to do than a Western
Blot (Incidentally, Western Blot is so-called, because the first person
to do ""blotting"" was E.M. Southern, so the blot was nick-named the
""Southern Blot"", and each new technique was given a different direction and
the name stuck.) ELISA involves add sample, add reagant, check color change.
	Anyway, this new test has an accuracy of 99.6% (4 false positives
in 1000 people)  which is not much worse than Westerns.
 
	AND, of course the usual disclaimer:  Although everyone with AIDS
has been shown to have antibody to HTLV-3, the reverse is not true.
The presence of antibody to HTLV-3 does not signify that a person has or
will get AIDS, but has merely been exposed to it or a cross-reacting virus.

Um, I've heard that a significant percentage of AIDS patients DO NOT
harbor HTLV-3 antibodies, and this bewildering state of affairs only
complicates the application of such tests.  Naturally, it isn't clear
in these cases whether the absence of antibodies reflects absence of

Today in New York, the Scientists Institute for Public Information met
to gather all valid information on AIDS to give to the press and thus
insure the accuracy of news coverage & public knowledge. It was hoped that
such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But, as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused to attend, unable or unwilling to find time in his 
schedule.  The fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused
the creation of three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen:
HTLV-III by Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much research & testing.

I know of two theories on this  point.  One  seems  reasonable,  the  other
frighteningly paranoid.
Reasonable:
One of the primary vectors of AIDS is anal  intercourse.  This  is  because
the  lining  of  the  rectum isn't built for such treatment and can develop
tears which provide a  direct  path  to  the  bloodstream.  The  virus  (or
whatever) is carried and passed on in semen.
Paranoid:
It is rumored that AIDS may be  part  of  a  biological-warfare  experiment
being performed by our own military.  The rumor contends they are testing a
virus that attacks  only  people  with  certain  specific  body  chemistry.
Ultimate  goal: a bug that kills only Russians (for example).  Legionaire's
Disease is said to have been a prototype.
I would discount these as paranoid  ravings  but  for  the  fact  that  our
military  was actually caught doing something almost as cold-blooded in the
San Francisco Bay area not  so  long  ago.  They  deliberately  released  a
tailored mild flu virus in the Bay area to see how the winds would disperse
it, based on patterns of who  caught  the  flu.  Five  innocent,  unknowing
citizens DIED because of that experiment.  Since then, I don't put ANYTHING
past them.
(If any of this is true, I suppose I'll be quietly abducted,  interrogated,
and disposed of in the next week or so -- all for passing on cocktail party
conversation.  Who says it's 1985?)

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained
by the characteristics of the populations in which it occurs.

	Well, it was actually more than a single article, and there were 
similar articles in Science and Nature.  
The facts are:
	1. HTLV-3 (the Aids-Related Virus) is found primarily in blood, but
also in saliva and semen, and maybe other places that haven't been explored
yet.
	2. The rectum is a) bacteriologically speaking, an exceptionally dirty
place, and b) not designed for intercourse (wrong epithelium).
 
	However, Steve does have his point. Just because something makes sense
logically, doesn't mean it is correct. Also, just as a grammatical point, the
use of the word ""vector"" was wrong. The correct phrase should have been
""means of transmission.""

	Where do people come up with these things?
	The virus has been around Africa for years, and does not solely
affect gays there.  
	It is passed, both in Africa and among non-Gays in the US (mostly IV
drug users) much more efficiently from men to women than from women to men,
mostly because semen contains cells that could be infected with the virus
(as does in some people, saliva). Hence it would, for similar reasons, pass
efficiently from men to men.
	It's not actually gays, per se, it's only sexually active gays, and
they are also highly overrepresented among a whole variety of rare diseases,
mostly sexually transmitted ones, but also hepatitis, etc.
	Also, remember, one of the first AIDS victims back in 1977 
admitted having over 2000 sexual partners (I think in the previous year alone,
but that number may be over several). A few people like that and that's all
you need for a major epidemic.
 
	Conclusion: given the mode of transmission of the virus (in blood,
semen and saliva) and the fact that healthy carriers can pass the disease,
and given the promiscuity of a visible subgroup of the gay population, it's
not really much of a suprise (now anyway that more is known) that gays are
overrepresented among AIDS victims.

	The following is from the Jan 11, 1985 issue of JAMA (253/2),
""The Incidence Rate of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome in Selected
Populations""
	Incidence is defined as the number of new cases reported per
a given time, usually (and in this case) in years for a given population,
the higher the incidence, the higher the risk of getting a disease. For 
chronic diseases, it is usually steady. For epidemics, it tends to rise
dramatically (as in AIDS) and then fall (something that AIDS has yet to
do)
	Some of the data:
Annual Incidence: 	Year	cases		Rate/100,000
			1978	4		0.002
(in US, total pop.	1979    9		0.004	
age 5 and above)        1980	44		0.02
			1981	239		0.11
			1982	961		0.44
			1983	2501		1.20
			->5/84  3096		1.43
Note the nearly 1000 fold increase in incidence. This is clearly a disease in
the exponential stage.
	1.5/100,000 means 1 in 66,000 Americans has AIDS, or if they were
spread uniformly, that would be one for every sellout football game. (That
last example is of course, facetious, but illustrative)
	However, they are not spread uniformly, as seen below:
	Interpretation follows the data:
	Group			# cases		Incidence
 
	Single Men (US)		3,752           8.9
	SM in Manhattan		1,358	     	175.5
	SM in other NY boroughs   413		 37.6
	SM in SF		  473		204.5
	SM in LA		  308		 44.2
	IV Drug Users (US)	1,381		113.3
	IVDU in NY		  675           203.2
	IVDU in New Jersey	  188		269.0
	Haitians (US before 1978)  27		  1.8
	    (US after 1/1/78)	  192		 82.0
	Hemophiliacs (severe)	   33		298.5
		(mild)		    2		 43.2
	In female contacts of
	male IV drug users	   26             3.1
	Persons receiving blood
	Adult (> 10 units)	   25		  4.8
	Children(> 10 units)	    5		 22.5
	Children (10 or less)       5		  0.8
Comments:
	Most incidence data have trouble with the reporting of cases. In this
case, however, the number of cases is probably more accurate than the 
population estimate.
	This reason however, is the reason the incidence is for Single
Men, and not for Sexually Active Gay Men (which has been the usual
phrasing of the risk group) because it is very easy to tell if a man is
single, but much harder (and more controversial) to find out if he is gay,
or if he is sexually active (and how would you define that) In fact, 87% of
AIDS victims who are single men are gay or bisexual. (Same Source)
 
	For IV drug users, NJ may be higher because the estimate for NJ
only included heroin users, and for NY and USA included heroine and cocaine.
Also, IV drug users are usually less mobile than gays, so pockets may 
develope
	Note the numbers for Haitians. The very low number before '78
probably shows that the disease came to Haiti at approximately the same
time it came to the US.  It might have even spread there from the US.
Either way, it means that the island itself is not to blame.
	For hemophiliacs and blood donors, the data clearly suggests that
the disease is in fact spread by blood (though possibly not exclusively)
since the risk is related to the amount of blood that the patient receives.
	There is one other thing not visible from the above selected numbers.
Transmission from males to females is much more common than from females to
males. It may have something to do with females (tending to have less
partners, perhaps?) or it may actually say something about the mode of
transmission of the disease.	
	Robert Gallo of the NCI suggested that not just the virus but also
infected tissue was necessary for the most efficient transfer of the disease,
and sperm contains cellular matter, so it might follow.
	Of course, the disease can be spread without cells. Factor VIII
(for hemophiliacs) is cell-free and has 40 total cases.
	OK, this article is a little too long.
	Next time, more on the soon-to-be released blood test.
Oh, somebody wanted sources for my first article:
	Here they are, from Nature, Dec 20-27 1984 
 
	The CD4 (T4) antigen is an essential component of the receptor for
the AIDS retrovirus.     p. 763.
	T-lymphocyte T4 molecule behaves as the receptor for human 
retrovirus LAV.     p.767. 	
	I didn't cite them the first time because they hadn't been published
yet.

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	I have my own small addition, I tested positive for ""hepatitis""
last summer, but negative for A/B.  I eventually discovered I had
mononucleosis.  Thus non-A/B hepatitis can also be a secondary symptom
of some other disease.

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

	The actual protein involved is called CD4, and it occurs on so-called
T4 cells.
	Now for some immunology:
	Blood Cells are divided into Red and White Cells.
	White Cells are divided into B-Cells which make antibodies and
T-cells, which are for cellular immunity (and also are the things that
cause graft rejection.)
	T-cells are divided into several classes (1 - 8 so far) of which
T4 are one of the most important kind.
	T4 cells are helper cells - they make the rest of the immune system
work better.
	Note: in the absence of T4 cells, the AIDS virus, which is HTLV-3
(also called LAV) cannot grow. Immunosuppressed people shouldn't be able to
get AIDS. Experimentally, immunosuppressed cats don't get FAIDS (Feline AIDS)
One of the reasons, therefore that Gays, Drug Users, etc., are more suseptible
to AIDS (Besides the fact that they are exposed to the virus more often) is
that they tend to get other infections more often which activate the immune
system and make more T4 cells for the AIDS virus to grow on. (Talk about
Molecular Catch-22s)
	I'm a MD/PhD candidate in Immunology and recently heard Robert Gallo
give a very well-organized seminar, so I'll followup with another posting
on the history of AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.","FhgStjPmxOgJ",19,1986-03-21,-10,11

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,
there is no way currently to get rid of the damn thing.","H75UzjNUdRYJ",19,1986-03-21,-9,26

I had dinner recently with a couple, one of whom is a psychiatrist, the other
a psychiatric social worker, who both work for Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Counseling Service.  Aside from the obvious issues of stigmatization and
confidentiality, they ask men who are concerned about HTLV-III exposure
and are considering being tested:
	""What would you do differently, if you knew?""
They argued pretty persuasively against being tested, for the following
reasons:
1.) a negative test is no license for increased sexual activity
    (to be meaningful, you'd have to be tested weeks to months after
    each new sexual partner, when in the meantime, you could be spreading
    the virus.)  In essence, every gay man should be behaving as if he were
    exposed, regardless of the test results.
2.) Denial (as in not knowing one's HTLV-III exposure) can be thought of as
    having some positive effects.  Too often, they have seen people who went
    to be tested out of curiosity, who, after hearing that they test positive,
    end up with severe emotional stress, certainly reducing their quality of
    life.

There certainly are political concerns against taking it, most of which are
similar to registering for the draft, etc., in which organizations which
have no right to the information can often obtain it against our will.
But for me, the deciding factor was the consequences.  I asked my doctor
what his advice is to patients who test negative (no HTLV-III virus), and
he said that he recommends following the safe sex guidelines and reducing
the number of sex partners, to avoid exposure to the virus.  Then I asked
what his advice is to patients with the virus, and his advice was the same,
to avoid exposing their partners.
The ""relief"" I might feel from a negative test result would in no way
offset the anxiety I would certainly feel if I tested positive.  The odds
are too negatively swayed; I'd rather not know.

be considerate (extremely considerate) of the health of others.
If you can take the screen without endangering yourself somehow (i.e.

A few years ago I signed up for an AIDS research study being done by the
University of Pittsburgh, as part of a four city project funded by the National
Institutes of Health (the other cities are, to the best of my recollection,
Baltimore, Chicago, and San Francisco).  The study started before HTLV-III
had even been identified, and thus part of the goal of the study was to track
the factors that may be involved in causing AIDS.  I had no reservations about
joining, since I have a very strong belief in empirical research (I sign up for
human interface studies at every opportunity, and always used to participate in
psych experiments as an undergraduate). 
Volunteers in the study came in twice a year to be interviewed on sexual
practices, undergo a physical, and give samples of blood (over a dozen vials at
a time; ouch), urine, semen (this was the fun part) and stool (blech! I can't
see myself ever getting into scat).  I knew at the time that a portion of my
blood would be frozen, to undergo whatever testing might become available at a
future time.  However, I hadn't really thought about the implications of a test
for a virus (or, as it turns out, antibodies to a virus), and I certainly hadn't
thought about many of the political and personal issues.  
In retrospect, the only surprise was that the virus and tests were discovered so
quickly; I would have signed up for the study even after LAV/HTLV-III had been
identified.  Why?  Because we still don't know why only a small percentage of
infected people actually come down with AIDS, and hence this sort of research is
very important.
I should also add that this particular study has been granted some sort of
insurance of confidentiality by the Feds.  I'm not quite sure what this implies,
but presumably it means that their records are more protected than a county
HTLV-III testing program for example.  On the other hand, this certificate was
given after I signed up for the study, so confidentiality obviously wasn't a
priority to me.
Once HTLV-III testing became available, the study did indeed retrieve the stored
blood, and start testing all of the participants.  (Nothing underhanded; we knew
that the potential for this was there when we signed up, although I suspect most
volunteers, like myself, hadn't thought about it very much.)  However, it was
entirely up to us as to whether we wanted to learn the results.  One of the
requirements for getting your results was that you had to participate in a group
discussion session and an individual counseling session before any HTLV-III
results would be revealed.  I think this was an excellent idea, far better than
the health department testing mills, even though I had to pull strings to bypass
this requirement (since I moved to New England before my results were
available).  
As I just indicated, I decided to find out what my results were.  Mostly this
was for my own peace of mind (although, if the tests had turned out positive, it
would have proved that the virus had a much longer incubation period that
previously suspected :-).  But also it was to help me decide how to lead my
life.  I think that if I had tested positive I would either a) decided to remain
celibate, which is close to what I've been doing anyway; b) limited my dating to
other men who tested positive, either through support groups or candid personal
ads; or c) limited my sexual activity to strictly safe, kinky stuff with little
or no chance of emotional attachments forming.
Which brings me to the last question, namely should a person who test positive
inform partners?  My response, as indicated, is that I would choose to avoid 
situations in which this was likely to become an issue.  I could not see myself
dating someone while burdened by the constant anxiety of knowing that someday I
would have to reveal this information if the relationship is going to continue.
I know this is evasive to some extent, since avoiding such situations doesn't
insure that they won't occur.  I can't honestly say what I would do if I were
in such a situation, although I like to think I would find the courage to be
honest from the start.  I guess I'm lucky in knowing that I won't be in that
situation at all.
The other side of the coin is how would I feel if I were going with someone who
revealed to me that he tests positive.  I have a close friend who is positive, 
so I know I can be with someone who's positive without freaking out (which is
not to say I have no anxieties, but only that they're quite manageable).  Thus,
if someone with whom I was forming an emotional attachment turned out to be
positive, I think I would be able to continue the relationship.  I would
probably evaluate the relationship in the context of a sex life that would no
doubt have some restrictions, which could potentially be an issue.  But I 
learned a long time ago not to expect to have all my fantasies fulfilled.
(Reality is more than enough fun, anyway.) 
 
Sorry for being so long winded.

Choice b is not a wise choice unless they practice safe sex.  The accepted
thinking is that the various mutations of HTLV-3 do not infect in quite
the same way and that a cross infection might be all you need to go
from non-symptomatic to symptomatic (ARC or AIDS).

1) I was worrying about my health all the time, to the point
where I wouldn't exercise well for fear that I might exacerbate
an AIDS or ARC condition (or so I rationalized).
2) I was practising category 1 (very likely safe) and category
2 (probably safe) sex with two partners and just didn't feel I
could justify category 2 with them unless I was fairly certain
I hadn't been exposed to the virus.
In other words, I was worrying enough so that it couldn't hurt
my mental condition all that much to find out a positive result
(although I could have been underestimating the impact it would
have on me) and I wanted to restrict myself to only category 1
sex if I had been exposed to the virus.
I wouldn't have taken the test unless I was sure to be
guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality through the
alternative test sites here in California.  If you decide
to have a personal physician conduct the test, ask the physician
not to record the result in your medical record, or anywhere
else.
Obviously, the decision of whether or not to take (one of) the
test(s) is highly charged and completely determined by individual
situation and feelings.  Certainly, one should be well aware of
what one is doing before taking a test which may let you know
of horrible consequences to come.  But not knowing and having
the disease might be even worse for some.

----------------------------------------------------
My favorite TV show with a gay/lesbian theme was an old episode of 
Cheers.  On that episode, an old friend of Sam's (who happens to have 
been a teammate on his professional baseball team) comes out as a gay 
man during a publicity show for his new book.  This part of the show
happens in the first five to ten minutes and the rest of the show
illustrates how people react to the news once the gay character is
off-stage. 
Sam is hurt and confused by the confession (""Yunno, why can't guys be 
guys?""); Dianne is cool and calm; and, Norm starts to get nervous that 
Cheers is going to become a gay bar once all the gay men find out how 
open Sam is to gay people.  
When a good-looking, well dressed couple of young men go up to the bar 
and order a light beer, Norm is convinced that the gay invasion has 
started.  The couple admits that they read in the paper about Sam's 
reaction to his buddy's comming out, and that they admire him for his 
stance.
Dianne adds fuel to the fire by stating to Norm that she knows for a 
fact that there are two gay men in the bar ""right at this very moment."" 
Norm organizes everyone else in the bar, and then procedes to go to
ridiculous lengths to drive the two young men out of the bar. 
After he finally succeeds, Norm gloats about his success.  
Unfortunately for him, Dianne tells him that the two gay men are 
still in the bar.  At which point, the two men on either side of Norm 
(older, graying, balding, casually dressed) lean toward him and kiss 
him on the cheek. [the curtain falls]
That's my favorite gay-themed TV show because it doesn't preach about 
being gay or having AIDS, but it delivers the message in a powerful 
way that we are everywhere and we're not all that different from you 
and yours.
Any thoughts?

Just call me George, its not my real name but being the gutless wonder
that I am I do not want to bare my soul and my real name at the
same time.  You may respond to the net or Steve Dyer will relay mail
back to me.
I am a computer professional, single, in my early thirties, and bisexual.
I am still quite confused about my sexuality despite having stuck one
or more feet out of the closet as long as 15 years ago.  I am currently
in psychotherapy with a ""non-aligned"" therapist (probably Jungian at
heart) who at least professes to believe that people are innately
bisexual; no fighting a therapist who wants to *change* me.
(How many therapists does it take to change a light bulb? One, but the
light bulb really has to want to change.)
A little background: My first sexual experience was at 10 or 11.  It
was with my best friend B.  I don't remember who initiated the
encounters, but after a while it definetly was me who initiated.
Aside from an adult Boy Scout leader, Mr. R, whose initiation rites were
a bit outside of social acceptability (the Patrol leader and assistant
were blindfolded and ""made"" to 69) I never had what could be termed a
seductive experience.
Incidently the adult leader was married, a pillar of the community etc.
and included his son in the initiations!  His son and I, being the
youngest, did not have explicitly sexual rites but did watch the
other's which were sexual.  The reason I mention this is that a lot
of people are horrified when I mention this and say that I was sexually
abused by this pillar (:-) and that even now, over 20 years later, I
should press charges or something absurd like that.  My personal reaction
is that Mr. R, while a sicky, did not harm me and after one season of
taking us for overnights did not continue.
I, on the other hand, had *very* strong cravings for sex and seduced,
or attempted to seduce, a number of peers.  Around the age of 14 B's
hetero feelings starting to blossom and he starting treating me abusely
(not physically, just socially).  Things never were emotional between
us, we never caressed or kissed or proclaimed love etc. but I guess
he felt guilty and wanted to distance himself.  Didn't stop him from
calling when ""he had the urge"" (of course I was allways willing).
I guess that, my sister seducing another friend (she later claimed
she did not know there was anything between us), and that asshole
Dr David Rueben's _Everything_You_Wanted_To_Know_About_Sex_ (but
couldn't find an educated homophobe to tell you) starting seriously
eroding my self confidence.  My own hetero feelings were starting
at the same time but lacking friends and having miserable role models
of parents I never dated or any of the other ""normal"" adolescent
activities.  When I was invited to a birthday party for one of my mother's
friend's children, I got sick the day of the party because of my
anxiety over going and playing spin the bottle.
The years 14-16 were the first part of my crazy years: drug use, running
away from home (hum, in restrospect I'm don't think that was so crazy,
my home was *very* nutty), declining scholastic achievment (I was
considered very gifted but my parents chose to ignore the pleas of
school officials to place me in a school for gifted).  Anyhow, to cut
thru the wallowing self pity, them years was very painful.  Around my
17th birthday (drivers license time) I discovered a Gay org at the
local college and, at least partially, came out.  No fan-fairs, earth
shaking, or most disappointing, personal problems disappearing.
My first hetero experience was that summer.  It was with the best friend
of my ""girlfriend"" (I was a just a friend to her, she tolerated my clumsy
attempts to go to bed with her).  My GF not only knew about me and her
friend, she let us use her bedroom while she listened from the guest
room.  From a physical standpoint the experience was okay, emotionally
it did nothing for me (she left in the middle of the night and seemed
uneasy around me after that, she was drunk and had been hinting and I
propositioned her).
My college years were bitter-sweet. A lot of promiscuous sex with men
and a lot of attempting sex in relationships with female friends.  I
managed a few times.  I was *very* out of the closet my freshman year
(except to family, going to a school far from home) but went back in
after that because I got too turned off my the campy/sarcastic people
active in the local gay org.
After college things a few things changed, I had a long term affair.
(""remember"", said N, married he, ""if things get emotional I will stop
this like that"" (snap of fingers).  Aside from that limitation
(which delighted me, being as the last thing *I* wanted was an
emotional relationship with a man) it was a good relationship.  We had
a good time together, doing non-sexual things more than sexual.
He insisted that I meet his family (gulp!) who did not know what our
relationship really was.  They thought (or did a damn good job of
pretending) that he was simply befriending another stray pup.
In the middle of that relationship I got involved with a women who lived
in my apartment building.  N, considerately, dropped the sexual portion
of our friendship for the duration.  L and I lived together for three
months and they were hell.  She was crazier than I was!  I couldn't adjust
to her sexual cycle (3 AM, and only when she wanted it) and she didn't
give a damn about mine (any time, especially 7 AM).  I learned alot about
JAP foreplay (two hours of begging and pleading).  I was so desperate
that even suspecting that she was cheating on me I proposed to her.
Thank god she said no!  The relationship ended when she borrowed my
car, failed to pick me up that night, and returned the next morning
man in tow (a neighbor later told me they spent the night in his apt.).
That evening I seduced (for lack of better term) a male friend and shortly
thereafter resumed sex with N.  That was 9 years ago.  Two years later
I spoiled a fine platonic friendship with a women by ignoring her lack
of interest in a deeper relationship and bugging the shit out of her.
After that I immersed myself in the bath house scene, until three years
ago when I went celibate because of AIDS fears.  A little over a year
ago I staring going to female prostitutes because ""I was getting crazy
for sex"" (yes, I masturbated all the time, no real relief).
When I heard that they thought prostitutes were HTLV-3 carriers I stopped
going (about 6 months ago) waited for 8 weeks and got the AIDS antibody
test (negative).  During this time a female friend (yep, you guessed it!)
We never got sexual, the feelings just got too crazy.  After that I
went back to the prostitute twice: first time was okay but I could have
done as good a job myself, second time I couln't touch her, the only
way I could orgasm was to pretend that I was having sex with a man.
I left convinced that there was proof that I am not bisexual, that I
am 100% percent homophile.  My therapist sees that experience as evidence
that I am in better touch with my needs (emotional and compassionate)
and I just felt the emptiness a bit earlier than usual (usually the ""glow""
fades about 10 minutes after I'm done).  I am toying with the idea of
going back to the Gay community, recent contacts with it have shown me
that there does exist a ""healthy"" (non-role playing monogamous) sub-
community.  My real concern is that the problems with women are not

with a man.  I might add, as an aside, that I find women *much* more
sexually attractive than men but enjoy sex better with a man.

hurt myself (and two of three hurt me).  I guess I'm just very confused

    Well the American Heritage Dictionary gives a few clinical definitions
    of drag: to forceibly pull, something that's boring and one states ""A
    Homosexual of one sex who dresses in clothes of the opposite sex"" This
    is interesting since there are an equal percentage of Heterosexual male
    cross dressers. I find no confusion between drag which may be worn as
    a goof on reality; costume and Halloween parties, Mardi Gras, etc. The
    other is a look which mught be more constant; the Gay urban clone. The
    guy may wear 3 piece suits to work but live in flannel shirts and levi
    501's during the rest of his waking hours. What a person chooses to wear
    on his own time should not be put down provided it looks natural. Strut-
    ting around all the time in a leather body harnass and leather chaps may
    look silly on the average street; I know I'de feel self conscious walking
    down Main Street in Nashua dripping in leather and chains. If a guy wears
    chinos, docksiders and a button down shirt, he's labeled as a yuppie around
    here, If it looks good on him and he's comfortable, I say so what! I was
    into the tight jeans and tee/muscle/flannel shirt look way before I heard
    the term ""gay clone"". Friends have told me that my form of leisure dress
    looks natural on me. I know people wo would wash their cars while wearing
    a shirt and tie. I don't think they're making a statement, justing wearing
    what's natural for them. I also wear a punktail. Now a lot of people think
    I'm making a social statement. I just *like* thd look of a tail on some men
    with short hair. I get tired of explaining away why there's this 6"" little
    trail down my neck.
>drag. After all the person who works in the financial district puts
>on a costume of a suit/tie to *show* others how he fits in and
>is successful -- isn't that drag?""
 
    This is an interesting point Rob, about the suit/tie. When I dress in jacket
    and tie, I seem to get more respect in stores, restaurants, etc than when I
    wear jeans. We're conditioned to believe that jacket+tie = success or at 
    least respectability. We equate jeans with blue collar, teens, etc. In some
    Near Eastern cultures a red dot on the nose or forehead acts as a caste mark
    The jacket, shirt and tie in business connotes; administration, management,
    etc. An executive who comes to the office in chinos and polo shirt might get
    repremanded; he's out of uniform just as a military officer who shows up for
    duty in civilian clothes would be told to go home and change. It's an ident-
    ity symbol, just as the muscle shity and tight faded 501's are to some urban
    gays ""I'm one of you guys!"" If they dress thius way in the ghetto to gain
    acceptance, then it's not a natural look, but a costume. My shirt and tie
    at work for me is more of a costume to appease the expectations of my sup-
    eriors.
>a costume or not. *To the extent* that you put on some clothes with
>the intention of them making a statement about yourself, it is a costume.
    Sure the shirt and tie at work make a statement that I'm some sort of admin-
    istrative/professional person and not an assembly line worker or janitor.
    A criminal or other lowlife can dress up just as easy as I can. underneath
    he's still a scum, but to the world he looks respectable.
>When a gay man puts on a leather outfit before going cruising at a

    Some gay men and establishments carry the 9 to 5 mentality of dressing into
    their leisure time. In cruising, Al Pacino was not allowed ot stay in a bar
    called the precinct or something like that because he was not in the proper
    uniform. I think (only me thinkin) that in some circles, the mode of dress
    goes beyond a costume and becomes a fetish. A friend of mine is somewhat
    effeminate but covers himself in leather and chains. he admits that it makes
    him feel more like a man. I think that some of these guys go everboard in
    ""Macho"" costume to cover up insecurities in their own levels of masculinity.

    Good point! when I wear jeans I'm not trying to make a statement. When a
    passerby notices the jeans, tank top and punktail, he/she may label me as
    gay, a punk, a rock band member, or whatever else they equate with the
    way I'm dressed. If I have an earring in my left ear (which I do but not
    at work) does that mean that I'm gay; to some folks it does which is why
    I don't go into meetings wearing a diamond stud.
>Then it no longer becomes a costume. Many styles of dress that were originally

    Sure! look at all the young heterosexual males who wear the classic Gay
    clone dress now and how many have pierced ears. Rock stars in vodeos dress
    the same way. It is interesting how a look that's labeled as avante garde
    one year, becomes a norm a few years or less later.

    Just like let's say a Black man who acts very nondescript outside of a black
    ghetto and talks jive when with his friends in a black neighborhood. I don't
    act campy at the office or at mom's but if my roomate and I were throw a 
    dinner party with 12 others then we may act campy, ""oh sis it's so nice to
    see you, give us a hug!"" My camp behavior can be turned on and off at will
    depending on the circumstances, some who have lived in a constant state of
    Oh Maryism! from years in the ghetto may be percieved as strange when they
    leave the security of the ghetto.

                            *  Gay Stereotypes in Film  *
 
    I'de like to make a point about cinema *period* I rented ""A View to Kill""
with Roger Moore as 007. Silicon Valley is in perilled by an ultra demented
industrialist. Well enough about the movie! Geee! maybe the British Secret
Service will protest the portrayal of their agents. James Bond has more lives
than an animal shelter full of cats. I've known a real government agent and he
told me that 90% of the time he was behind a desk. the same goes for cops. On
tv they're all altru tough and look as if they all walked out of the pages of
""GQ"" I have 4 cousins who are police officers, one vice and they all say that
tv cop shows are all doo doo. Sure they see action but not in the non stop
""bang bang, shoot'm up, car chase"" way Hollywood interprets them.
    Well! only my opinion but Welcome Home Bobby, Early Frost and Consenting
Adult were all good as far as I was concerned. Yeah so they were all attractive,
successful, etc. If you pay attention (outside of sitcoms) most of the leading
characters are portrayed as some sort of upwardly mobile successful person.
The new gay characters are just victims of *dramatization* like everybody else.
The stories are fiction and in fiction there are no hard set rules regarding
who can be what, etc. Just be glad that we're no longer shown as twisted little
men in trenchcoats, handing poisoned candy to school children or neurotics who
kill themselves by the 3rd commercial break. IN Frost and Adult the gay charact-
ers were shown to be guys who stood up for what they were and in the end were
(quasi) accepted. Some one complained about the character in Adult being a pre-
med student and trophy winning college swimmer, are you jealous??? Isn't it nice
for a change to be shown as the all American who confronts the jerks in the film
with ""yeah...well I'm gay toooooo!"" and they back off. if you don't like it, 
there are two littl knobs on your tv; one marked on/off and the other tuning!

gays"" in cinema/tv. Last night I spent the evening re-cataloging my video lib-
rary. Of the ~260 movies I have about 25 either have a gay theme or there's a
gay character. I queued up just about all of the quazi-gay films and watched
bits and pieces. The one movie I forgot I had is ""That Certain Summer"" with
Hal Holbrook. I can remember when it first aired in the very early 70's, my
mom ordering dad to change the channel when it was becomming clear that there
was going to be mention of homosexuals. I thought it was well done for the
times (early 70's) but the way the son was informed lacked some class, ""yes
I'm a homosexual, that means I slep with men"". I agree with another another
man's posting, that we're much more then sleeping with the same sex.
    Then I rummaged through ""The Sergeant"" with Rod Steiger. Now this one por-
trays the drill instructor as an extreme/suicidal if he ever admits it closet
case. In the end of the film he starts becomming aware that he's got the hots
for the young private and runs off in the woods to blow his brains out. Ok so
this was also a product of the early 70's, being gay=being miserable; better
dead than to bed with Ted :-)
    Around this same time I forget which network aired it but some of you will
remember ""An American Family"" about the average $100,000/year family and how
it disintegrated. Of course a lot of time was spent zooming on Lance, the eff-
eminate gay son and his antics. This was exactly when I was just admitting I was
gay and found it hard to relate to Lance. Of course Boys in the Band, a little
earlier helped keep alive the negative ""self hating"" stereotypes unless the
viewer could read between the retrace lines. A gay person could watch the movie
and maybe see someone he knew or just laugh it off. The straight viewer, on the
other hand had to accept this as Gospel about all of us.
    I can remember the stinkola that ""Cruising"" raised in the gay community. I
have this movie also and have watched it many times. There is a very small elem-
ent of heavy S & M in the gay world and hte movie made this point a few times;
in the opening disclaimor and statements made by the police chief. My roomate
went to see it when it first opened and said a straight couple ran from the 
theatre when the fist fucking scene was shown. It seemed that the only good 
character in the movie was Al Pacino's gay neighbor who gets murdered by his
roomate?????
    Making Love was good but too much got glossed over. I went so see it on
opneing night in Boston and there were as few folks who walked out in disgust
when they showed the young doctor and the writer headed for the bedroom. This
goes along with my mom's thinking, it's ok to be gay but don't let me see two
men being affectionate toward one another. The movie's weak point came toward
the end where all of a sudden *POOF* Zack's divorced and in a long term lover
relationship with a lawyer or doctor. One line that kinda gives us a left handed
slap is where Zack returns to visit his ex wife after a friend's funeral. The
wife makes the statement that she's happy for both of them. A few friends inter-
preted this as saying that Zack could not be happy for himself.....hmmmmm!
    Then there's ""Partners"" with Ryan O'neil and John Hurt as the wimpy closeted
cop who saves the day in the end. I found nothing offensive in this movie but a
few people I know thought it was condescending toward gays. Most of the actors
were pretty realistic and the houswarming party seemed to be just another South
End party, everybody had their clothes on were dancing, drinking, eating, soc-
ializing; not much out of the ordinary. I'm sure we've all seen guys like the
lecherous auntie at the motel desk too.
    The more I look through my library the more I see a gay character being 
subliminally snuck in. In ""The Road Warrior"" I had to see the movie 5 times bef-
ore I realized that the punked out blond who rode with the warrior on the motor-
cycle was his lover. Yeah he got killed, not because he was gay but because he
got inthe way of the Aborigine's boomerang. Then there was ""Midnight Express""
where the was an allusion to a gay lover relationship forming between the Amer-
ican and a Swedish Prisioner. In the book there was a bit more  graphic repres-
entation but the movie kept the fact under wraps. More and more there are gay 
parts. I was watching Twilight Zone last Friday and the last vignette was about
a truck driver who hauls souls to hell. In the story he learns that there are
a lot of folks going to hell who should have gone ot heaven. In the end he's
screening the passengers in the cattle truck as to why they think they're going
to hell. He gets past the murderers, etc and singles out a junkie, old woman,
a regular Joe slob and a gay male for salvation; sets them free! I don't know
but just that one scene made me feel good. Whoever wrote the screenplay at least
did not equate being gay with condemnation.
    As for recent, last few year made for tv stuff, it seems they're making up
for lost time including gay situations and characters. All in the Family, Maude
and Phyllis were probably a couple of the first sitcoms to treat gays in a pos-
itive light as normal. Soap comes along with the only two normal stabilizing 
forces as a Black butler and gay son. Same can be said for Brothers; the gay
brother seeming to be the most normal and well adjusted in the cast. Hollywood
still isn't ready to show the full spectrum of gay life. In an Early Frost it
was ok to show the two lovers walking arm and arm ""Buddy Style"" down any street
U.S.A. I don't think that my mom's ready to see two lovers on tv curling up
together and shutting off the bedroom light yet. It took quite a while for
Blacks to be shown as more than watermellon eating lazy folks, then they were 
all upper crust, now most Black roles run the gamut of criminal to President
of the United States. 
    Over the years I've met a couple of gay men who worked in the Hollywood
movie industry as camera and audio men, wardrobe planners/designers, etc, They
all said that the industry has a much larger than average number of gays working
for the studios but added that the movie industry is one of the most homo-
phobic in the country. It's amazing what is allowed in other genres that are
peddled at the suburban mall cinemas. Take the rash of psycho killer movies
that have been relaesed in recent years; The Friday the 13th series, Halloween
series and now Nightmare on Elm Street. I caught Nightmare on Elm Street on
cable and it about made me gag; there's no sense to the level of violence that
the public gets spoon fed. Paul Newman bought movie rights to The Front Runner
and no one wanted to touch it unless the gay character was replaced with a fem-
ale. That was a few years ago, are we ready now to show a normal college coach
who happens to be gay portrayed by a big buck actor; I think so? Will the pub-
lic rush out to see it, I dunno?  Oh well jes me talkin!

Examiner, entitled ""Extreme proposal by AIDS researchers"",
describes a proposal to the military for a $12.5 million research 
project to prove that AIDS can be casually transmitted. The proposal
also advocates the design and implementation of identification
and containment measures that are, at best, ineffective and, at
worst, an egregious violation of civil liberties.
The AIMS (Advanced Investigation of Medical Science) Group and the
Institute for Cancer Research, both located in the Pacific
Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, are the authors of
the proposal. Both groups have a history of military research.
The AIMS Group has performed classified research on biological and 
chemical warfare. The goals of the study discount the considerable
body of scientific evidence that AIDS is not casually transmitted.
The proposal identifies Stanford and the Hoover Institute as
subcontractors responsible for research on the ethical and legal
issues of identification and containment. SRI is identified as a
subcontractor responsible for designing ""intense"" behavior
modification techniques to be applied to U.S. servicemen that will
lessen their chances of catching AIDS.
The general reaction from the scientific community is that this is
very bad science. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has a
long and dark history of pouring lots our money into stupid and 
unreasonable pursuits. They're not likely to be dissuaded by
established scientific evidence (my opinion).

I have some Gay friends who have been arrested in Toronto Ontario.  When word
got around that they were Gay, they were subject to a lot of violence in
prison -- something to the order of -- ``he's gay, so it is fine to gang rape
him -- after all, he loves this stuff.''  Solitary confinement sucks, but I

Unfortunately, Gays and prison do not make a happy mix.  Sometime
over the winter, I heard (also on NPR) about the Denver jail
using color coded uniforms to distinguish Gay prisoners from
others.  The same lame argument about protection was made, but
it sure sounds like Pink Triangles to me.
(Pink triangles were the badge used by the Nazis to designate
Gay prisoners in the concentration camps, is case you haven't
read about it.  An excellent book is The Men With the Pink

If we want to protect ourselves, we cannot rely on some sense of
social justice from even our so called liberal friends.  The only
way to ensure that we don't end up in ""protective"" isolation
is to kick the enemy in the balls.  Don't forget that it was the

Why is quarantining someone with the ability to transmit a fatal disease
the ability of someone being able to transmit a fatal disease a lame
excuse?  I keep reading things that say, in effect ""why do anything about
people infected with the virus since the they may not develop aids?""  The
point that is missed with this idiocy is that most people are not opposed to
individuals walking around with fatal conditions, but rather to individuals
walking around who can give them a fatal condition.  I know of no one who
thinks heart patients, emphysema patients, etc. should be quarantined, even
though the may drop dead at any moment, because their afflictions cannot harm
others.  Nevertheless, many states restrict people with active tuberculosis
from holding certain jobs, and restrict people with untreated epilepsy from
perfroming certain task, because their afflictions can harm other people.
If AIDS was not contagious, or if people with full blown AIDS were not
contagious, society would probably be a lot less concerned about people
with AIDS walking about.  But the odds are that anyone who tests positive
to HTLVIII is infectious, and possibly more infectious than individuals
who are symptomatic.  Therefore whether an infected individual ever actually
comes down with AIDS or ARC is beside the point to society at large. 
Studies in some prisons have shown that much less than half of the inmates
have been exposed to the virus.  Although it may be unfair to make someone
who sells heroin spend a few years (or maybe months, giving sentencing in this
country) alone because he has been infected, it doesn't seem as unfair as
sentencing another inmate to death when he is gang raped by one or more
infected individuals.  When you commit crimes one of the chances you take is
that you will be deprived of some basic freedoms - one of those freedoms being
the ability to murder by infecting other people with your fatal diseases.

Although some people might claim that all homosexuals, whether criminal or
not, are equal, I am astonished to see someone purporting to be pro-homosexual
make this claim.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to sort out
people for death and slave labor.  Admittedly the ACLU and their ilk would
like the rest of us to believe that we are either on the verge of, or
have slipped into, the horrors of fascism in this country, but we are 
thankfully a long way from it.   It is an insult to those who died under
the Nazis to equate their ordeals with the inability of convicted criminals
to dress as they want.

It's an extremely lame excuse.  It is a breach of someone's fundamental civil

Garbage.  There is *no* proof or evidence to show that anyone who tests HTLV3
positive is infectious.  There is evidence to suggest that those who test HTLV3
postive have between a 10 and 15% chance of being diagnosed with one or more
of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS within 5 years after
testing HTLV3 positive.  Pretty low odds!  This *fact* is not beside the
point.  It has further been shown that HTLV3 is *very* difficult to transmit,
and that it probably requires multiple exposure to get the retrovirus.

What crime has someone who is infected with HTLV3 committed?  If you mean to 
imply that all HTLV3 exposed people are homosexual, and that homosexuality
is a crime, you are wrong.  Not all HTLV3-positive people are homosexual
men.  Fact.  And consensual acts between adults are not illegal in many states,
and for that matter, a lot of what goes on between heteros is statute illegal.
That you think that anyone who has committed a crime is to be deprived of the
basic right to life, you are one sick puppy.

Wrong.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to single out homosexuals
in concentration camps, just as they used stars of david to identify Jews and
cirles to identify ""intellectuals.""  Everyone was at risk for death in the
concentration camps.

We're not talking about the right of people to dress in their Calvin's in
prison.  We're talking about the singling out people for the soul reason
that they may be infectious, they may be homosexual, they may be diagnosed
with AIDS/ARC.  There is nothing to support any of those contentions in
being diagnosed HTLV3 positive.  There is no relationship between HTLV3
and one's sexuality, gender, race, color, creed, religion, eye color,
national origin, IQ, or food preferences.  NONE.  Viruses don't discriminate,
people do.","uaAqzE5LvNMJ",11,1986-02-13,-41,29

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I started to reply to Keith's posting by answering him line for line,
but my overall point was being lost in the line-by-line debate.  My
point is the following:  I am sick and tired of people stating grandly
on one hand that one must not generalize, and then on the other hand
blasting gay men in the community for being shallow, petty, full of
gossip, catty, et. al.  This type of argument is contradictory,
hypocritical, and divisive. 
Yes, I have seen the cattiness in certain circles.  Yes, I am aware of
the gossip in certain circles.  Yes, I am aware that some gay men have
problems setting goals and thinking about the future.  Yes, I am aware
that some gay men have difficulties having stable relationships (not 
exactly a unique problem considering the current divorce statistics). 
***Yes, I am aware that gay men like this might compose the majority in 
certain gay circles.***
However, to say that these are the traits of the ""gay male community""
is rubbish.  If you believe otherwise, I claim that you are not being
perceptive enough, that you are only seeing what frightens you the
most, what makes you most insecure about your own masculinity, and
what rattles your own conception of what ""men"" or ""gay men"" should be.
On the one hand, you say ""don't generalize.""  On the other hand, you
complain about gay men's ""fish handshakes,"" and you ""point into the
mirror"" to warn us about gossipy queens (do you gossip?  should you 
really have been pointing into a mirror?).  You admire men who avoid the
gay community even when the association ""would clearly be beneficial to the
individual,""  but then you claim to admire lesbians because they are
*more* active (politically) in the gay community (again, another
generalization).  
If you *really* don't approve of generalizations, stop using them to
""prove"" your points. 
<END_OF_FLAME>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me relate two quick stories to prove my point.
I play for a gay men's basketball team in Boston, Massachusetts.  All 
in all, I enjoy their company more than any gay ""group"" I have ever 
encountered (in the bars, in the Boston Alliance of Gay and Lesbian 
Youth, in a gay health club to which I belong, and in the AIDS Action 
Committee).  
For instance, one of my old boyfriends didn't know who Larry Bird was
(player for the Boston Celtics professional basketball
team).  Unlike my old boyfriend, I could really *talk* with these
guys!  Finally, I had found a whole group of gay men who liked sports.
However, I sensed that although these guys were easy going about 
traditionally masculine behavior, they were *very* uptight about 
anything that could be linked to being ""gay.""  Since I have a limited 
reserve of ""Butch-ness,"" this troubled me.
For instance, the first time I came to the gym to play ball with the
guys, I asked if this was the gay basketball group. They all looked at
me nervously; after all, I had said the forbidden ""G"" word.  Time in and
time out, they made it clear that they were (read: ""wanted to be"") just
a bunch of ""guys"" playing basketball.  During one game, a friend
of mine said, ""he's such a lady; there's more Clinique on that
body than is stocked in Filene's department store.""  This line would
have been funny if it weren't accompanied by a vicious ""I'm above all
that"" sneer. 
I get the feeling that these guys would never watch Dynasty, wear
Clinique products, shop in certain stores, listen to Disco music, or
wear 501 jeans because that is ""gay"" behavior.  In my opinion, if you
don't like a product, don't use it; if you don't like a product
because you are worried about what other people think, you are
foolish. 
Story number 2:  
I just finished working out at my health club and I decided to go to 
the Boston Ramrod (gay bar) for a drink (a really healthy thing to do, 
huh?).  When I walked into the bar, I noticed the usual assortment of 
folks (yes, the catty, gossipy people included; after all, they are 
the most noticeable).  
One guy stood out of the crowd.  He was dressed in jeans, leather 
chaps, a ringed harness, and a leather hat.  I thought he looked 
ridiculous!  So, as I drank my beer, I imagined all sorts of sordid 
details about this guy in order to pass the time and to amuse myself.  
After all, I wouldn't be caught *dead* in an outfit like that (except 
on Halloween---ahem).
To my surprise (I *attract* men like that?), the man approached me and
we began to talk.  He explained that he had read that Thursday nights
were ""leather and denim"" nights at the Ramrod, and that he thought that
he would be out of place if he *didn't* dress that way.  He explained
that he worked in Boston's financial district, lived in the 
area, and so forth.  We had an incredibly enjoyable talk.  Not once
did he come-on to me (""you know how promiscuous those leathermen
are""), and as a matter of fact, he expressed his joy that he found
someone with which to pass the time of day. We shook hands (firmly I
might add) and parted friends. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It amazes me the number of people who turn to me to tell me that the
bars are only filled with nasty, gossipy queens.  I wonder if those
people are including themselves in that group; after all, I see them
in the bars, too.  It kind of reminds me of Boston's local cruising
park (where men meet anonymously to have sex); nobody has ever been
there, but they can all give eye-witness accounts of what goes on in
the bushes. 
***You can't generalize***  Under close inspection, generalizations
never describe real people.  We are too complex to fit into rigid 
stereotypes.  If you choose to avoid the gay community, then you are 
missing the opportunity to enjoy a wide variety of people.  
The next time you go into a ""gay"" event, really try to notice the
types of people who surround you.  Especially, take time to notice the
quiet ones.  Appreciate the variety in our community and add your own
personality to the melting pot.  You and your local gay community will
be richer because of it.  Don't discredit the notion of community just 
because you differ from some gay people.  We need to appreciate our 
differences as much as those traits we have in common.
What do others think about this issue?

In answering many of the replies to my posting concerning parents and
coming out, I was reminded of an article I once read by Armistead
Maupin.  The article presents his ""gay"" philosophy of life.  I agree
with *all* points made in the article.  *You* might not agree with
everything, but I hope that you'll find the article interesting! 
Straight folks, bisexual people, and people who hate making
distinctions, replace the word ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" with the appropriate
adjective.  I think that you'll find that the article applies to you
too. 
By the way, KenWatch is taking a vacation until I can finish the next

KenWatch (not including myself and my friends at work), and 7 people 
are opposed.  Please send me *personal mail* as to whether you want to 
see future issues of ""Rubbish in Reply to Rubbish.""  Don't waste space 
on the net.  If enough people want it to go away, hey!  I can use the

Sorry to imply that KenWatch was classy, intelligent, and so forth.  Do 
you think I'd waste that much time on Ken Arndt?  AAAAaaahhhhhhaaaa,

Design for Living:  Strengthening the Body Politic Seven Ways
by Armistead Maupin
[Reprinted without permission from the ""Advocate,"" Issue 411, 
January 8, 1985]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Several months ago my friend Timothy Leary gave me some advice about 
my upcoming national book tour. 
""Before you go,"" he suggested, ""figure out exactly what you want to 
say, and don't be embarrassed to say it over and over again.  It may 
be the hundredth time you've said it, but it's the first time they've 
heard it, so make sure you sound like you mean it.  The hundredth time 
is just as important as the first.""
He was right.
Three weeks and 15 cities later, I had summoned up the same answers so 
often that I felt like a cross between Dr. Ruth Westheimer and the 
audio-animatronics Abe Lincoln at DisneyLand.  Most of the questions 
were about my books (""When will Mouse find a lover?"" and ""Didn't you 
kill Connie twice?""  were two of the biggies), but a surprising number 
of them cast me in the role of Coming-Out Consultant, a keeper of the 
mysteries of Happy Homohood.
Remembering Tim's suggestions, I surveyed my most frequent responses 
and discovered the following blueprint for a more fulfilling life.  
Read it once, and I promise I won't bring it up again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Stop Begging for Acceptance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Homosexuality is still an anathema to most people in this 
country---even to many homosexuals.  If you camp out on the doorstep 
of society waiting for ""the climate"" to change, you'll be there until 
Joan Rivers registers Democratic.
Your job is to accept yourself---joyfully and with no apologies--and 
get on with the adventure of your life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Don't Run Away from Straight People.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
They need variety in their lives just as much as you do, and you'll 
forfeit the heady experience of feeling exotic if you limit yourself 
to the company of your own kind.
Furthermore, you have plenty to teach your straight friends about 
tolerance and humor and the comfortable enjoyment of their own 
sexuality. (Judging from ""Donahue,"" many of them have only now begun to 
learn about foreplay; we, on the other hand, have entire resorts built 
around the practice.)
Besides, it's time you stopped thinking of heterosexuals as the enemy. 
It's both convenient and comforting to bemoan the cardboard villainy 
of Jerry Falwell and friends, but the real culprits in this melodrama 
are just as queer as you are.
They sleep with you by night and conspire to keep you invisible by 
day.  They are studio-chiefs and bank presidents and talk-show hosts, 
and they don't give a damn about your oppression because they've got 
their piece of the pie, and they got it by living a lie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Refuse to Cooperate in the Lie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not your responsibility to ""be discreet"" for the sake of people 
who are still ashamed of their own natures.  And don't tell me about 
""job security.""  Nobody's job will ever be safe until the general 
public is permitted to recognize the full scope of our homosexual 
population.  
Does that include teachers?
You bet it does.  Have you forgotten already how much it hurt to be 14 
and gay and scared to death of it?  Doesn't it gall you just a little 
that your ""discreet"" lesbian social-studies teacher went home every 
day to her lover and her cats and her Ann Bannon novels without once 
giving you even a clue that there was hope for your own future?
What earthly good is your discretion, when teen-agers are still being 
murdered for the crime of effeminacy?
I know, I know---you have a right to keep your private life private.  
Well, you do that, my friend--but don't expect the world not to notice 
what you're really saying about yourself.  And the rest of us.
Lighten up, Lucille.  There's help on the way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Stir Up Some Shit Now and Again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Last spring I wrote a commentary for the ""Los Angeles Times"" on the 
subject of television's shoddy treatment of homosexuality.  The piece 
originally contained a sentence to the effect that ""it's high time the 
public found out there are just as many homosexuals who resemble 
Richard Chamberlain as there are who resemble Richard Simmons.""
The editor cut it.  When I asked him why, he said: ""Because it's 
libelous, that's why.""
To which I replied: ""In the first place, I'm not saying that Richard 
Chamberlain is gay; I'm simply saying there are plenty of gay men who 
resemble him.  In the second place, even if I were saying that Richard 
Chamberlain is gay, it wouldn't be a libelous remark, because I'm gay 
myself and I don't say those things with malice.  I don't *accuse* 
anyone of being gay; I state it as a matter of fact or opinion.""
Three years earlier, I confronted a similar problem with an editor at 
the ""New York Times"" who forbade me to make reference in an essay to 
""gay film writer Vito Russo"" without some written proof from Vito---an 
affidavit, no less---that he was in fact, one of *those*.
I asked the editor if the ""Times"" took similar precautions when 
mention was made of black or Jewish people.  Surely there are plenty 
of Americans who would hate to be mistaken for black or Jewish, so why 
isn't their bigotry protected by the strong arm of the newspaper libel 
law?
""Because,"" said the editor, ""it's just not the same thing.""
And they're doing their damnest to keep it that way.  When the new 
city of West Hollywood assembled its council last month, the 
Associated Press identified the three openly gay members as ""admitted 
homosexuals.""  Admitted, get it?  Fifteen years after the Stonewall 
Rebellion, the wire service wants to make it perfectly clear that 
homosexuality is still a dirty little secret that requires full 
confession before it can be mentioned at all.
If you don't raise some hell, that isn't going to change.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Don't Sell your Soul to the Gay Commercial Culture
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, go ahead, if you insist, but you'd better be prepared to accept 
the Butt Plug as the cornerstone of Western Civilization.
I am dumbfounded by the number of bright and beautiful men out there 
who submerge themselves completely in the quagmire of gay ghetto life, 
then wonder why their lives seem loveless and predictable.
What the hell did they expect?
If you have no more imagination than to swap one schlock-heavy 
""lifestyle"" for another, you haven't learned a god-damned thing from 
the gay experience.
I'm not talking about sex here; I'm talking about old-fashioned bad 
taste.
No, Virginia, we *don't* all have good taste.  We are just as 
susceptible to the pit falls of tackiness as everyone else in the 
world.  Your pissing and moaning about the shallowness of *other* 
faggots falls on deaf ears when you're wearing a T-shirt that says 
""This face seats five.""
Not long ago I sat transfixed before my TV screen while an earnest 
young man told a gay cable announcer about his dream of becoming Mr. 
Leather Something-or-Other.  He was seeking the title, he said, ""in 
order to serve the community and help humanity.""  He wore tit rings 
and a codpiece and a rather fetching little cross-your-heart harness, 
but he sounded for all the world like a Junior Miss contestant from 
Medesto [California].
If our fledging culture fails us, it will be because we forgot how to 
question it, forgot how to laugh at it in the very same way we laugh 
at Tupperware and Velveeta and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Stop Insulting the People You Love by Assuming They Don't Know 
    You're Gay.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When I began my book tour, a publicist in New York implored me to 
leave his name out of it, because ""my family doesn't know about 
my...uh, lifestyle.""
Maybe not, but they must be the dumbest bunch this side of Westchester 
County [New York]; I could tell he was gay *over the telephone*.
When my own father learned of my homosexuality (he read it in 
""Newsweek""), he told me he'd suspected as much since I'd been a 
teen-ager.  I could've made life a lot easier for both of us if I'd 
had the guts to say what was on my mind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Learn to Feel Mortal.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If AIDS hasn't reminded you that your days are numbered---and always 
have been---then stop for a moment and remind yourself.  *Your days 
are numbered, Babycakes*.  Are you living them for yourself and the 
people you love, or are you living them for people you fear?
I can't help thinking of a neighbor of mine, a dutiful government 
employee who kept up appearances for years and years, kept them up 
until the day he died, in fact--of a heart attack, in the back row of 
an all-male fuck film.
Appearances don't count for squat when they stick you in the ground 
(all right, or scatter you to the winds), so why should you waste a 
single moment of *your* life seeming to be something you don't want to 
be?
Lord, that's so simple.  If you hate your job, quit it.  If your 
friends are tedious, go out and find new ones.  You are *queer*, you 
lucky fool, and that makes you one of life's buccaneers, free from the 
clutter of 2.000 years of Judeo-Christian sermonizing.  Stop feeling 
sorry for yourself and start hoisting your sails.  You haven't a 
moment to loose.

               Jason Attempts Answering More Cosmic Gay Questions
                                      Or
                           ""Why'd Ya Do Watcha Did?""
    I got quite a few responses to the ""It Ain't Pretty"" posting, what was
surprising was that all of the respondants concurred with my article and 
admitted to having same feelings. This is interesting since in person many may
have changed the subject or told me to stick it in my ear. This could be in
part to the semi anonymity that a computer link affords. Many are more willing
to share inner feelings to a total stranger then to their closest friends. This
is almost like an electronic confessional in a way with the priest seated behind
a terminal on one coast and the confessor on the opposite coast. Last year a gay
man sent me personal mail to say he enjoyed the Jason postings. He went on at
length to tell me he had contracted AIDS and shared all of his personal fears
and hopes for the future. He was a read only subscriber who has long since left
the network. I carried on a dialogue with him until he told me he was too sick
to continue working and bid me goodbye. I was glad at least that he had the love
and support of his employer, family and friends from what he told me. But! the
total purpose of this newsgroup is not *just* for emotional and spiritual cath-
arsis; I've enjoyed may articles written by others on subjects ranging from
Gay Parenting, What people do over the holidays, AIDS research, Gay music, gay
this and gay that. Through pen/keyboard pals I've learned what gay life is like
in other countries as well as other parts of the United States. Many non gay
readers have sent me mail saying that life on the single heterosexual side of
the tracks is no different then on our side. This has been (for me) a forum of
understanding (Arndtism aside) and I hope it continues to be so in the future.
Even Ken may be looking for answers, although in an unorthadox manner. None of
us can read the other poster's minds, only what we see on our screens.
    Well! before I diverge from the subject any further, let me get back on 
track....lemmee see, where was I? As I said before, many have shared (in priv-
ate) feelings that I have put before the group. I'm not looking for cheap
psychotherapy but since my minor in college was ""Psych"" I've always had a keen
interest in what makes people tick and have observed various behaviors pretty
closely. What I've come up with is that most of us act fairly rational in our
everyday lives; when it comes to matters of the heart then many of us go a 
little squirrely, behave irratioanlly, etc.
    I had mentioned that I'm much more warmly received in heterosexual groups
than in gay ones even though most of these people know that I'm gay. Maybe
because I act masculine and have *butch* hobbies they consider me one of the
guys, maybe they're just a bunch of well adjusted heterosexuals who feel sec-
ure in themselves enough to know I'm not a threat. Straight people on the whole
tend to be less insecure than we are. Sure! why not! they are the status quo
and don't have as much to worry about as far as being accepted goes. I have seen
some of the most disgustingly ugly fat straight men who had very positive images
of themselves,""I'm a good looking dude!"" that were popular and made out with the
women like a Tomcat in heat. I've also seen some of the most incredibly great
looking gay men who felt they weren't worthy of ever hoping to be liked, let
alone loved! When ""Small Town Boy"" by Bronski Beat came out I could identify
with the lyrics, ""Pushed around and kicked around, always the lonely boy"" I
allowed the hatred of my peers to become my own self hatred. When I looked in
the mirror I saw an awfully ugly person as years went by. After coming out I
expected acceptance but found out that gays can be just as rejecting of their
own as the homophobes are of them; I felt even uglier. I'm just now learning
to go easier on myself and say, ""you're not a bad looking person at all and
talented to boot, despite what they think"". 
    The insecurity in gay men can come across as jealousy of others, resulting
in attitude and catty behavior to the object of their envy. Of course you'll
never know that hte other person wishes he was you or had your traits. He may
dish or in other ways discount you as a person in front of others. In this way
he can attract more attention to himself. One thing I have learned about gay
social groups/circles is that there is already an unspoken pecking order. There
may be an inner circle of kingpins who bask in attention. Now I or some new
comer show up and the fun begins. They may take an instant liking to me or rej-
ect my presence. If they see that I don't pose a threat to the status quo or
that I would compliment/enhance their attractiveness, then I may be asked to
join in. On the other hand if I seem to be overly attractive in their eyes
and they feel that I may steal some of their fire, they will ignore/reject
the fact that I'm there. They may even circulate through the crowd whispering
subtle warnings about me to their friends. This will help assure that no one
actually finds out that I could be in fact, a very nice person. Let me give 
you a couple of true, real life experiences I've had. I'll bet many of you
have been on both ends of these scenarios.
    I used to hang out at a local gay bar until I learned how the clientel
acted. The place attaracted the same basic crowd every week with a few out of
towners passing through on weekends. Most of the regulars knew each other so
gossip was common. All of a sudden I was aware that I wasn't welcome; the 
doorman started hassling me, I had a hard time getting served and when I walk-
ed through the bar it was like Moses parting the Red Sea as the crowd moved
aside and stared as I passed. After a while I got quite concerned and since
I was kinda friendly with the manager I asked to chat with him in private. We
got together after closing time and I voiced my concerns. He asked me if I was
into kinky sex to which I said no and questioned why he was asking this. I found
out a heavy rumor had started that I was into heavy S & M and had a torture
chamber in my apartment. I also suppposedly had sent a couple of guys to th
hospital. The manager asked me to be honest, ""do you have AIDS?"" geeeze no
wonder people were running away, I had become an AIDS infected dungeon master!
I got furious at hearing this and asked who started the rumor!! He said to the
best of his knowledge there were a few guys who thought I was a real hunk and
wanted to go to bed with me. Since I had never noticed anyone eyeing me and took
action on it, they interptreted this as a rejection. The rational of their act-
ions was, ""well he's too stuck up to talk with me. Well I'll fix him! If I can't
have him then no one else will either!"" This is one of the most vicious things
some jaded queen can ever pull on another person and it's quite common among
a lot of gay circles...petty jealousy turned into hatred. I never found out who
the people were that started the rumors, just as well since I may have started
indulging in heavy S & M with a certain few men.
    In another case I had been invited to attend a new gay social group's meet-
ing. Right from the start I fit right in and felt welcome. A lot of the members
said that they thought I was a welcome change and addition to the group. I beg-
an chairing a few meetings, then something went wrong, everyone started pulling
away. I was left in the corner all of a sudden and again started wondering what
was happening. I found out that the founder of the group, who's house we met at
had started some ugly rumors about me.....why? One night I dropped in on him
and of course he had nothing to say, wanted me to leave. I took him by the 
shoulders and pushed him up against the wall, demanding to know what his problem
was, then I'de leave. He broke down crying and said that he was afraid I was go-
ing to become the center of attention, that everyone liked me and a few wanted
to sleep with me. The guy was a real hunk and had enjoyed the limelight until
now. He also said that he wanted to go to  bed with me which I found flattering.
I asked why he just didn't come out and talk with me directly. His reply was
that he didn't want to get rejected. this one eneded up happier; I spent the
night with him and had a wonderful time. The two of us agreed that we would co-
chair the next meeting on Jealousy and childish gay insecurities and how they
destroy our solidarity. He and I went on to become friends as well as fuck bud-
dies until he moved to L.A.
    The last case is a very close friend who I'm just beginning to understand
after 7 years. Ever since we became close he would compete with me on every sub-
ject we discussed. If I said I had a nice dinner, he had one that was 10 times
better, If I met a hot guy and slept with him, I wouldn't get the first sentence
out and he's be telling me how he almost scored with a perfect 10! He asked to 
see my Jason articles and said that no one would be interested in reading them,
he could do better. The funny thing is that this poor guy hasn't really accom-
plished anything spectacular in his life. He's a wonderful guy but one of the
most insecure people I know. Everything I did became a challenge to him; what 
was even worse at the time was that I discovered he was in love with me and
felt because I didn't acknowledge and act on his erotic attraction that I was
now an opponent on the erotic field of competition. At times he would admit to
being envious of things I had done, the men I had dated and my looks/body. I
have often told him, ""you have to be happy with yourself, you're a good person.
You can't be me and probably wouldn't want to if you were."" To this day he
still carries on in rut of inertia, still competes in his own mind. I can't
stop him, only he can become self confident enough so that we compliment one
another and are not in a constant state of petty competition. I wish there were
more gay men like my last roomate; a self confident, friendly person who has no
time for petty gay games. The two of us never competed or felt the need to gos-
sip behind one another's backs. We were both open in introducing each other to
our friends. I know there are many other well adjusted, self confident, polite
and openly friendly gays out there, but so far they have eluded my field of
vision.
    I was raised a Catholic and a Christian. As a boy I never understood the
reasoning behind many actions that we bill as ""sins"". I just knew that for
some reason jealously, covetous behavior, lieing, gossiping and all the catty
stuff a lot of people wallow in was a no no in God's eyes. I think I have a
better understanding now, not just because God doesn't approve but because it
drasticly reduces our ability to interact as brothers and sisters down here on
the planet. We must rise above the petty bickering as gay people, lest we all
drown in our own shit. In my earlier posting I mentioned speaking to a couple
of straight Black friends. Blacks have suffered a common oppression, if they
spent all their time leaving one another out because so and so was too black
or someone was afriad that someone else might become too popular, there might
not have been a Martin Luthor King Jr, there might not be Blacks in management
positions or blacks in government, etc, etc. They share a common bond of racial
heritage as well as a history of pain and discrimination. The building I work
in has many Black employees. What I notice is that whoever they are, they are
always friendly to one another, greeting, smiling and chatting as they pass;
even to s newcomer. This is not just at work since I have been the only white
at black house parties and social functions. There was warmth and acceptance,
even to me who felt out of place but was encouraged to fit right in.
    On the other hand we as gay men and women are not a bonefide ""minority""
therefore not taken seriously. I have yet to apply for a job where a question
on the application (right there with race, creed, nationality) is sexual pref-
erance: Check one | | Straight | | Bisexual | | Gay | | Other please state.
We have no real reason to stick together other than our common oppression and
the fact that we make love withsame sexed members. Richard Pryor made a state-
ment on stage that gay liberation was the right to suck cock! I'll tell you,
if I were heterosexual that's what I'de think on the surface! To me I'de like
it to be more; not having to fear physical harm for being gay, not fearing loss
of job or apartment, being shown the same respect as any other tax paying Amer-
icans and being able to point to the crowd marching down the street on Gay Pride
day proclaiming, ""These are my brothers and sisters, all united"". Of course
someone may shout out of the crowd, ""you're not my brother or friend, go away
I heard you're bad news"". Well, actually one guy may whisper to another, ""ppssst
see the guy with the video camera, stay away from him, I hear he fucks dogs and
cats"". This of course is as it stands now.
    Lookism is a real problem in our community and a major contributor to the
in/out crowd syndrome. Now be honest kids, how many of you have been at a bar or
party and this much older, not very attractive person stands next to you; does-
n't say or do anything, just stands there and you all of a sudden decide to move
I'll bet you didn't feel comfortable around him because you were afraid someone
may think he's with you. How many times have you been chatting with someone you
may not find attractive and all of a sudden a friend walks in, you turn and
totally disregard the person you've been talking to; afraid of what your friend
might say about your choice of company. Aw c'mon I know a lot of you, especially
you young whippah snappahs can identify with this. Well! it's just not polite,
they're just as gay as you and deserve the same recognition as you get. You may
be old and not so pretty some day. Remember what hte Bible says, ""Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you"". What this boils down to is don't trash oth-
ers unless you're a masochist and enjoy it yourself. If being snubbed hurts your
feelings don't pass it on to the next guy. The bitchiness buck keeps getting 
passed on and on and on in the gay world and there's no excuse for it. Stop and
think about it for a while, someone gets hurt and you may look like a little
shining, slightly tarnished star. Your friends may approve but deep down I'll
bet they don't trust you and would not think twice of trashing you.
   Along thee lines of ""Do unto others"" is the prejudgment of a new face. Ok 
you see a wonderously handsome guy wno you want to get to know, you fromulate
your witty introduction while wiping your sweaty palms on your jeans, then
decide, what the hell! why bother! he probably a snob and a jerk! You walk 
away always holding on to the opinion that Mr Hunk is a jerkoff, and you pass
this information on to friends. What gets accomplished; you have insulated your-
self from the possible hurt of rejection and made yourself look good in your
mind's eye, you have passed up the possability of a hot night in bed or at least
making a new chum, have polarized others against this person even though you
know nothing more than he's gorgeous, you have in subtle ways hurt further gay
solidarity as a group and you have passed the bitchiness buck once again.
    Why not just go up and say ""Hi"" I don't think he'll pull a gun out and shoot
you (although from the bulge in his jeans he's carrying some kinda weapon:-) for
saying hello. The worst thing that he could do is walk away or say something
trite in passing by. What gets hurt....your pride, not gay pride but your own
selfish pride.
    The good looking get ignored, snubbed and gossiped about just as much as the
less attractive, better beleive it boys! I dated a guy once who worked as a mod-
el for a big agancy in New York. Ya know what, he asked why a good looking guy
like me saw anything in him....aw! c'mon gimmee a break. Even though this guy
was an absolute 10 (shhhh be still my heat); had a body Naulilus would kill for,
the face of an angel, the dicka death and the charisma of a rock star....he felt
he was ugly! So here we are walking hand in hand wondering why the other saw any
ting in us; needless to say the relationship was short lived. I lter learned 
that most guys wouldda killed to go out with him but figured they were not wor-
thy to bask in his shadow, therefore he was avoided like the plague. What laid
beneath the face, muscles and everything else was a very sweet, quiet and shy
person who had been labeled as a snob.
    I've run into many men in non threatening envoronments who actively snubbed
me at gay bars and parties. Once they got to chatting with me they admitted to
having me figured all wrong. They were under the impression in the bar that
because I was muscular and dressed the part of the hot clone, that I was un-
approachable, therefore a jerk! What they found in private, away from their
friends is that I'm pretty laid back, open, soft spoken and friendly. What we
must all do is give each other a chance instead of pronouncing the verdict of
""guilty"" before having all the facts on a person. If the American judicial
system worked like the gay social mileiu does, everyone would be in prison, with
no hope of parole.
    I can usually tell fairly easy if a person is a snob and jerk. Their haughty
behavior will give them away. If the tall dark stranger is just kinda quiet and
alone he's probably just that ""quiet and alone"" with no airs or affectations. I
cannot see labeling a guy as arrogant or stuck up, just because he's the lone
wolf or outsider, but many do.
    To put somebody else down or make them feel unwelcome as a way of making
ourselves feel better is a cheap shot. Those of you who may do it should stop
and think for a while about how secure you feel about yourself. This can be a
hard and painful process. You may find out that you don't really have any good
friends, that you don't think you're worth knowing yourself, etc. Take a minute
to  examine the reasons you reject/snub others. What is it about them that you
don't like; are you envious of their looks, career, personality or anything
else? If you are, then stop right there before attempting to sabotage their
success in a situation. What's at stake; your pride, your own shaky position
on the social totem pole, your likability, etc? Do some emotional houseclean-
ing on yourself before you attack someone else. As thge Bible also says, ""let
he who is without sin cast the first stone"". This is a very hard thing to do
without some serious thinking on your own part. Ok everybody....drop the rocks!
    Before closing I'de like to talk briefly about why gay men seem to surround
themselves (especially the younger ones) with guys who they feel will make them
look good. Beauty is only skin deep but it sure turns a lotta heads. Underneath
we're all made of the same blood, guts and bones that psycho horror flicks enjoy
splattering on the screen....not very pretty at all...yech! We all posess an
immortal soul (which some would sell for some looks) and a common humanity. We
also share our gayness and sensitivity. Gays are among some of the most sensit-
ive, empathetic and polite people in human services. As waiters, health workers
and other public servants they are the friendliest. So! why not treat your gay
brothers even better, regardless of their looks or what others have told you.
A gay hairdresser may treat an ugly old bag lady with more respect then some-
one he's introduced to who's nose may not be the right shape. I chose my few
friends on content and character, not on slick packaging. Many guys are able
to get by on looks alone and lack any social etiquette whatsoever. They are
the ones who will surround themselves with an entourage of pretty men who are
as shallow as themselves. I'm not generalizing, I've just seen it too many
times to write it off as a delusion. Needless to say I'm not involved with
the beautiful who's looks will pass. I'm dieing to see what they have left
when the final curtain of old age falls. 
     Going back to the Gay Pride March I notice that this is one day a year in
Boston where everybody acts like brothers and sisters. There's a lot of hugging
and and comaraderee. People who act like I was found under a rock the rest of
the year treat me like a long lost friend. Why can't we act like this toward
one another 365 days a year, regardless whether the other guy is Black, older,
not terribly attractive or whatever other flaw he has. We're all flawed in one
way or another. As a non recognized minority we have to stick together and open-
ly embrace the new gay face seeking acceptance and commradeship. This will take
a lot of work and I don't really expect to see it happen for quite a while. As
a group we have a lot of neuroses to get over and a lot of growing up to do.
Gay women complain to me that gay men are too flighty, irresponsible, and phony,
gay men complain that the dykes are taking over the bar. I agree with the gay
women. C'mon children lets get over the irrational judgements and bickering;
if we don't we all go down together.....

  The New York Native printed a UPI wire service article recently which
  quoted a British urinary and venereal disease expert, John Seale, on
  this topic.
  He said that, since 1949, biological warfare research centers knew
  about the highly lethal Visna virus in sheep. The virus grew easily
  in cell cultures, had a structure remarkably similar to the AIDS
  virus, and caused a similar disease. The AIDS virus has one gene
  extra over the Visna virus, but, says Seale, ""inserting an extra
  gene into a virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engin-
  eering"".
  He went on to say that it was likely that the potential of developing
  the Visna virus for use in biological warfare was considered by
  research establishments both in the East and the West, though ""it
  would have been a very odd one for the West to make because it is so
  slow to develop"".
  The idea that the AIDS virus had been manipulated in the laboratory
  by biological scientists merited ""serious consideration"", he said.

     What You Can Do:  Bias Crime Legislation
     by Kevin Berrill
Bias crime legislation is a relatively new means of responding to anti-gay
violence and other crimes motivated by bigotry.  Gay individuals and
organizations concerned about anti-gay violence may want to consider pursuing
this type of legislation in their state or local community.
According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Law Report (1985), there are now
twenty nine states that have laws which address ""ethnic vandalism"" and/or
""ethnic intimidation.""  The purpose of these laws is to deter bias-motivated
crimes -- crimes such as vandalism, intimidation and violence which are
directed against persons (or their property) because of their religion, race,
ethnicity, sexual orientation or membership in other specified groups.  Bias
crime laws may help to facilitate prosecution of bias incidents;  usually they
help increase penalties for them.
Critics of bias crime legislation argue that already-existing laws are adequate
to prosecute and punish perpetrators of ""hate crimes.""  They point out that
increasing penalties for bias attacks against members of certain groups amounts
to ""special protections.""  However, NGTF and many other civil rights
organizations maintain that groups which are especially victimized need -- and
deserve -- the extra protection this type of legislation affords.  We believe
that crimes of bias are particularly heinous because they are directed not only
at the individual, but the entire community s/he represents.  They are intended
to violate and isolate all members of the targeted group and to discourage
their visibility.  Such crimes also create an atmosphere of tension and
suspicion that can polarize whole communites, thus opening the way for even
greater violence.
In 1984, Seattle, Wahsington, and the State of California passed the first bias
crime laws that specifically included protections for lesbians and gay men.
This past June, the Seattle City Council passed a malicious harrassment
ordinance, following a serious outbreak of attacks against gay people.
Existing law required a series of threats for arrest and conviction, but the
new law requires just one threat ""that puts a person in reasonable fear of
harm"" if prosecutors can prove that the victim was threatened because of his or
her sexual orientation.  The maximum penalty is a $500 fine and six months in
jail.  Other groups protected under the city human rights law are now also
protected under this new law or by the state's malicious harassment law.
In California, the passage of AP 848 added ""sexual orientation,"" as well as
""age"" and ""disability,"" to an existing law which established the right to be
free from violence or the threat of violence.  The law enables victims to sue
for damages plus $10,000 if they can show that violence or threats of violence
were committed against them on the basis of their sexual orientation, age, or
disability.  Threats and violence based on race, religion, sex, national origin
and position in a labor dispute were already covered in the existing law.  AB
848 also allows victims to ""petition the courts for preventive relief from
patterns of violence and threats of violence.""
Not every effort to promote bias crime legislation has been successful.  Bills
similar to those in California and Seattle have failed in legislatures in
Minnesota, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington.  Nevertheless, at a time when gay
civil rights bills are frequently failing, bias crime legislation may offer
more promise of success.  Indeed, promoting an adequate official response to
anti-gay violence is one of the least controversial issues on the lesbian and
gay agenda, and some legislators who are ""against gay rights"" may be more
willing to consider a bill that would seek to prevent crimes of violence
against gay people.  In addition, hearings and media attention related to such
a bill would help lawmakers and the general public recognize that this is a
significant problem which deserves to be treated as seriously as crimes against
racial, ethnic and religious minorities and other groups.
Lobbying on such a bill would also afford lesbian and gay groups the
opportunity to educate legislators about the linkage between anti-gay violence
and the need for gay civil rights legislation.  In can be pointed out that as
long as gay people are vulnerable to discrimination in employment, housing,
etc., most will be unwilling to report crimes against them and to seek legal
redress.  Without civil rights, gays are inhibited from exercising rights they
are already ""guaranteed.""  In communities where lesbians and gay men are not
protected from discriminiation, lobbying around a bias crime bill could help to
""break the ice"" for a gay civil rights bill.  (In states or municipalities
where a gay civil rights bill is close at hand, introducing a bias crime bill
may not always be advisable.  Such legislation could divert the support of
officials who would otherwise vote for a gay civil rights bill.)

NGTF urges individuals and organizations interested in promoting bias crime
legislation to contact us.  We will provide you with copies of all passed and
pending legislation -- both civil and criminal -- which address anti-gay
violence and other crimes of bias.  In addition, we will provide you with a
list of lobbyists and legislators who have worked in support of this type of
legislation.  At the present time NGTF is also pursuing federal bias crime
legislation; we'll keep you informed of our efforts in this arena.

The best way to keep from getting AIDS is to sit down and keep your
mouth shut.
The point, not missed by the great unwashed masses, about all the AIDS
""information/education"" is those little terms 'no evidence to date', it
seems that', there is no sign of . . . ' that betray that NO ONE REALLY
KNOWS FOR SURE the full extent of the vectors for AIDS.
I don't TRUST the doctors, government authorities, etc. as far as I can
throw them.  Do you???  (Remember Swine Flu?)  Not that they are trying 
to fool us, but it's just that I get the uneasy feeling everyone is trying
to calm things down and are they telling us what they think we need/want
to hear or what they really believe to be the case?  In effect they are
really saying, ""we don't know"" to the questions about how it spreads, etc.
Sure we know some, but for instance we now know that the blood tests are
not as good as once stated for safeguarding the nation's blood supply.  What
else are we going to find out, eh?  I mean after they told us to not take
precautions with kids in school, food handlers, insects, etc.
The above, I think, is the reason there is still much concern about contracting
AIDS on the part of 'low risk groups' - the great unwashed masses.  Does anyone
else feel uneasy about the pronouncements from the 'experts'??
What about the issue, coming to the fore with smokers, of employment of 
people who take health risks that will cause their employers money for
health care????  If 'high risk groups' are identified (just like smokers)
will employers not hire them for the above reason and if so is that fair?
Anyone care to look into the crystal ball vis a vis homosexuals???  (Someone
can ask Ron Rizzo for me since he doesn't read my postings but manages to
address them and not mention my name - sex with women 'unnatural' indeed, a
great reply to my postings.)
Gotta go gang.  Happy Holidays  (I really mean that.)

That's funny, Ken.  You expect the rest of the world to trust such
authorities blindly when you quote them to support your viewpoint and then
say ""See?"".  The moral?  Only believe authorities who tell you what you
like to hear.  Right, Ken?

I just saw Istvan Szabo's film ""Colonel Redl"" (German, subtitles),
starring Klaus Maria Brandauer (""Mephisto"") in the title role.
Albert Redl was a talented & ambitious head of military intelligence 
in the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the final years of the Hapsburg
dynasty preceding the outbreak of WW1, who died amidst a scandal
under mysterious circumstances.  The film portrays Redl as homosexual,
originally idealistic but increasingly corrupted, and ultimately
scapegoated by the Archduke Rudolph to rally flagging morale in the
arm; Redl is forced into suicide when he refuses to cooperate in his own
frame-up.  Like the earlier Szabo/Brandauer collaboration ""Mephisto"",
about an ambitious & amoral actor who consorts with Nazis and ends up
their victim, the direction and acting are breathtaking and brilliant:
Brandauer's simply amazing, once again.  The recreation of turn-of-the-
century Vienna & Galicia is near-perfect.  The movie is ""loosely based""
on historical events and John Osborne's play, ""A Patriot For Me.""  The
film must be rich with allusions to the present (Hungary continues to
slyly but carefully snip more of the ties binding them to the USSR) but
I'm not up on events well enough to interpret them.  Don't miss this
film!
I just finished reading Margaret Yourcenar's ""The Abyss,"" a meticulously
researched and elegantly written historical novel about 16th century
Europe.  The book, in the writing from 1921 to 1964 (Yourcenar is 82),
is a kind of intellectual thriller, its main character, Zeno, a homosexual
Flemish alchemist, physician, philosopher & free-thinker (modeled on real
near-contemporaries such as da Vinci, Paracelsus, Giordano Bruno, Tomasso
Campanella, Erasmus, Ambroise Pare, Cardan, etc.) crisscrossing the Flanders, 
France, Austria & Italy of the reformation, counter-reformation and wars of 
religion, staying one step ahead of the Inquisition and Protestant zealots 
while scorning most of humankind and the follies and brutality of his age.
	One of this month's NYReviews has a long article on Yourcenar's
writing.  The reviewer considers Yourcenar the greatest women writer of 
the century (I think this is excessive) and wonders if sexism has kept
her from winning the Nobel Prize, but also points out that most of the
the protagonists/heroes in Yourcenar's fiction are somewhat misanthropic
homosexual men, subtle, acute, & severe, while her female characters are
nearly all unsympathetic, often mindless or foolish.
	The book features a lesbian Calvinist couple.
	A gay historical note: in her afterword on the composition of the
novel, Yourcenar claims that Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohen-
heim), Campanella, Etienne Dolet (a famous atheistic Parisian printer who
was burned at the stake), & other alchemists/free-thinkers of the time
were homosexual, suspected of being such, and there are records of their
""companions.""  I remember reading somewhere a claim that the Dutch humanist 
Erasmus was gay, and even possibly the philosopher Bruno.  There are also
other striking similarities: eg, a number of these figures, like Zeno,
were illegitimate (da Vinci, Erasmus).
Louis Crompton's ""Byron & Greek Love: Homophobia in 19th Century England""
got a glowing review from Bernard Knox in NYR a few issues ago, a surprise
considering the Review's two-faced handling of gay issues.  Crompton's
book must be one of the best pieces of scholarship on a gay topic, in a
class with works by Kenneth Dover (""Greek Homosexuality"") and John Boswell
(""Christianity, Social Tolerance & Homosexuality).  It uses a close inves-
tigation of the poet Byron's bisexuality to illuminate homophobia in
Georgian (early 19th century) England and to reveal an incredible corpus
of unpublished writings on homosexuality by Jeremy Bentham, jurist, poli-
tical reformer & the founder of utilitarianism.  Bentham wrote nearly
500 pages on topics such as homophobia, sexuality, and homosexuality
from legal, historical, scriptural, aesthetic, biological, & political
points of view, publishing anonymously a reinterpretation of the New
Testament ""Not Paul But Jesus"", and anticipating many of the issues, 
perceptions and arguments of the gay liberation movement of the late 20th
century.  Dating from as early as 1784, these writings now make Bentham
history's first gay activist.
	I have only one bone to pick:  Crompton is on opposite sides from
Boswell of a split in gay scholarship (to me, a rather silly, futile and
fractious quarrel that won't produce anything).  Crompton espouses a
""social constructionist"" view of gay history: it asserts that the category
""gay"" or even ""homosexual"" and its associated behaviors and attitudes are
historically new, a product of changed group consciousness, so that
same-sex sexuality prior to the latter 19th (maybe now late-18th?)
century is different in kind from what we understand as ""gay"" or
""homosexual"" (or ""heterosexual"", for that matter).  I like this view 
for its intellectual audacity, but I think it's patently false if applied
literally to the past (& incredibly arrogant & ethno/historicocentric
as well).  My one criticism of the book is that Crompton thus fails
to cite Boswell's work at all, and he takes traditional homophobic
interpretations (of scripture, law, & literature) at face value, seemingly
refusing to consider Boswell's counterevidence/arguments out of mere parti-
sanship.
	I urge all netters with any interest in history, gay topics, or
simply fine scholarship, to read Crompton's book.

Nonoxynol-9 is a mild detergent used in spermicides and various
other ""feminine hygiene"" products to prevent pregnancy and V.D.
It works by bursting the outer protein cap of sperm and various
disease organisms.  In laboratory tests, this detergent quickly
and effectively kills herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, CMV, yeast,
trichomonas, and amoebas.  Most recently, it also has been found
to kill AIDS virus easily in the test tube.  This is promising
news, however nonoxynol-9 is considerably more effective under
laboratory conditions than in actual sexual use because:
a.) The inert ingredients in spermicides -- foams, gels, and
creams -- do not always spread evenly or form a sufficient
chemical barrier for nonoxynol-9 to kill pathogens before they can
reach uninfected tissue.
b.) People often use spermicides incorrectly and only when they
""think"" a partner is infected.
c.) People abandon condoms instead of using nonoxynol-9 and
condoms together.
It is very tempting to use nonoxynol-9 as a layer of prevention
against AIDS while engaging in oral sex and anal intercourse.
But make sure spermicides don't irritate your skin, your mouth,
or your rectum.  When in doubt, check with your doctor.  And to
be sure the doctor's really up  on the subject, be well informed
yourself.  (See ""Reading Up On Condoms and Spermicides."")
Studies show that:
1. Nonoxynol-9 has had a very good safety record for 35 years and
has been used by Gays in spermicides and a couple of lubricants
for anal intercourse over the last 7 years without any reports of
problems.  A preliminary study by Bruce Voeller, Ph.D indicates that
the intestines of 50 spermicide anal users were healthy.  Animal
research which studied nonoxynol-9 excretion through the intestines
also showed no abnormalities.  However, spermicides have only been
tested for safe human use on the skin or in the vagina.  The FDA
noted in 1980 that spermicides are regularly swollowed during
oral sex.  Because of their extremely low toxicity and because
nonoxynol-9 is used as a wetting agent in foods, the FDA deemed
spermicides safe when eaten in small quantities.
2. Spermicides provide very important protection from common STD
transmission if used properly and every time a person has
intercourse (remember, the testing on spermicides and AIDS s
incomplete).  However, the effectiveness drops quickly from 90%+
to 70% or less effectiveness when not used exactly as instructed
on the label.
3. Spermicides and condoms used together and correctly result in
much greater disease prevention than either technique alone.
4. At this point not enough is known about the effect of nonoxynol-9
on human intestines (especially during sex) or about AIDS virus to
recommend spermicides totally without reservation for anal sex OR
to recommend strongly against them!  But they are certainly
recommended for vaginal intercourse as a layer of AIDS prevention
(provided a person is not allergic to them -- remember that
changing brands usually takes care of this problem).","9pLhaEH0yzAJ",23,1985-12-04,2,15

Possibly, but nearly every pleasure involves some sort of risk.
Everyone who eats raw oysters runs some risk of being poisoned, and
everyone who likes driving at 100 on the Mass Pike runs some risk of
crashing.  Lest I be criticized for ignoring the social implications
of disease, societies make these decisions as well, and people die as a
result.
I don't think it's irresponsible, either from a personal or a societal
point of view, to review the risks involved---with the help of lists
such as the one recently posted to this newsgroup, the one that caused
all of the fuss---and decide that certain acts which could conceivably
lead to disease and death are worth some risk.  A rich, sweet, wet kiss
is the primary symbol of human romance, and I'll be damned if I give it
up.  Who cares about sex, even plants do that (:-)).

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

       and ""Erastes Pill"", in ""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
       ""Amongst	ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank	and
       power  in the gay world,	and the	opposing sides are drawn in
       terms of	self-identification and	public appearance.  What is
       worse,  this  struggle for hierarchy will continue unless we
       abandon some of the dogmas of the gay establishment. ...
       ""The shared impressions and arguments  put  forth  here	are
       tentative,  our generalizations are riddled with	exceptions,
       and we imagine that some	of our speculations will be  proved
       incorrect.
       ""First, consider	two modes of self-perception. ...  Many	gay
       men  like  to  identify themselves either as 'straight gays'
       (R-types) or not	(Q-types).
       R-types view themselves
       ""Rs like	to think that they pass	as straights on	the street.
       They  value  highly their acceptance in general society,	and
       many are	careful	to  sustain  friendships  in  the  straight
       community.   Rs	are  proud  of	their manly appearance,	and
       typically rankle	over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
       gay  males.   They  may	be  receptive to, or even obsessive
       about,  social  conventions  and	 norms	based	on   gender
       distinction;  ...   completely  homosexual Rs may persist in
       describing themselves as	'bisexual.'
       ""The one	thread connecting the  childhoods  of  Rs  we  have
       interviewed  is	peer  acceptability.  By and large, Rs were
       kids who, for one reason	 or  another,  could  conform  with
       ease,  and  so did. ...	Young Rs, it seems, were only dimly
       aware of	 their	need  for  the	rewards	 of  acceptability,
       effortlessly   achieved.	   So  the  arrival  of	 adolescent
       sexuality sent a	stunning shock	through	 well-adjusted	Rs.
       ...   Many  boys	 ignored and disguised this discovery until
       they could come to terms	with it.  In the meantime,  teenage
       Rs  struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer
       image.  Even as they grew up to enjoy sex with other boys on
       the  sly, conformism in all other aspects of demeanor became
       the self-exacted	quid pro quo.
       Q-types view themselves
       ""... these gays often are not, and feel	that  they  do	not
       wish  to	 be, 'straight-acting and appearing.' The extreme Q
       is a homosexual on display.   (He  may  not  always  be	one
       display ... [e.g.] in the presence of family and	employers.)
       On the street, he may assume any	one of the  several  public
       personas	 most  familiar	 to the	straight world:	the pomaded
       and permed 'fem', the titanic leather  master,  the  clipped
       clone,  the  GQ	hyperboy, and others. ...  Qs are outwardly
       gayified; they have bought into strict outgroup	stereotypes
       which, whether screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
       constitute  a  burlesque	 of  gender  roles.   Qs  think	 of
       themselves  as visible gays, and	tend to	make such a profile
       central to their	ego structure. ...
       ""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,  and  Qs	are
       perhaps more likely than	Rs to be drawn toward the asylum of
       gay ghettos in urban centers. ...
       ""Whereas	Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and	 so
       did, many Qs felt that, for whatever reasons, they could	not
       conform during their youth, and so did not.   Those  reasons
       might  include passivity, effeminacy, homeliness, remarkable
       prettiness, lack	of athletic  skill,  or	 almost	 any  other
       cause   for   unpopularity  among  male	youth.	 At  first,
       evidently, many Qs were unhappy loners  who  salvaged  their
       self-esteem by making a lodestar	virtue out of individualism
       rather than peer	acceptance.  But  non-conformity  engenders
       anti-conformism.	  So  some  Qs	went further and acquired a
       taste for  outrageousness,  actively  calculating  shock	 to
       others  in  order to reinforce their social status as rebels
       with a cause. ...
       ""As the years go	by, and	they learn that	they are not alone,
       Qs  adopt zealously the visible uniforms	and credos of their
       supporting outgroups. ...  Surveys have shown that, for many
       Qs,  camp  behavior  is	a  passing phase of overt defiance,
       toned down in later years.
       ""When those gays	who boast R-status meet	 those	who  defend
       Q-status, there can be trouble.	First, let's look at things
       for the viewpoint of the	 R.   For  one	thing,	the  sexual
       objects	of  Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs, for the most part
       are scorned. ...	 It is the 'fem' [from among the variety of
       Q-type  personas]  who bears the	brunt of the invective from
       Rs. ...
       ""[Gay] bars are often regarded by  Rs  as  the  bastions	 of
       self-segregated	Qs - branded as	twinkie	bars, leather bars,
       etc. - and so may be viewed with	distaste. ...
       ""We should mention at this point	that those Rs who shun	the
       bars  find it more difficult to lead satisfactory sex lives.
       They have trouble meeting other Rs because,  unlike  visible
       Qs,  out	 in  the  straight  world most Rs have banished	any
       tell-tale signals of  homosexuality  from  their	 conformist
       uniforms	and are	wary of	mistaken self-exposures. ...
       ""To make	sexual matters still more difficult  for  many	Rs,
       they  face two more unique dilemmas. ...	 First,	... a Q	may
       be drawn	to,  and  satisfied  by,  a  relationship  with	 an
       acceptably  masculine  R.   But what of the classic R-type -
       the 'all-American boy' whose only felt  shortcoming  is	his
       sexual  preference?   For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual
       object possessing the one feature  he  feels  he	 lacks	and
       wishes  to  capture - may very well be the straight boy,	who
       is, by definition, unattainable.	...
       ""The second sexual dilemma faced	by Rs involves	the  ritual
       of  sex-play  itself.   For  at	least  some  Rs,  it seems,
       masculine role performance is the  most	thrilling  part	 of
       sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened in homosexual practices
       such as passive anal sex	or active fellatio. ...
       ""But even if the	 R  is	contentedly  'out'  to	family	and
       friends,	 and  self-exposure  is	 not an	issue, he may still
       dislike Qs for two related reasons.
       ""First, because the R has typically conformed with  ease	 to
       the  mainstream,	 the  exaggerated  outgroup  displays of Qs
       simply baffle him.  Why would any person	choose to draw such
       public ridicule and abuse, he wonders? ...  'I don't see	why
       they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
       [we  interviewed].   'It	 obviously looks phony and fools no
       one.' At	best, then, many Rs come to view Qs  the  way  that
       many  straights view homosexuals	en bloc, as somehow foolish
       and trivial, a nationality of sterile cuckoos. ...
       ""Second,	Qs do more than	baffle Rs - they also  irritate	 Rs
       terribly,  to  a	 degree	that more detached straights cannot
       understand.  Many Rs plainly resent  being  identified  with
       the  Qs,	and blame them for the weird profile of	homosexuals
       as a whole. ...
       ""Like most gay males, it	seems,	even  exotic  Qs  hear	the
       siren  call  of	the rutting R.	And so relations between Qs
       and Rs grow still more tense.
       ""It is our impression that, for both Rs and  Qs,	 archetypal
       Rs  the	'idols	of  the	 tribe.'  It is	the R whose natural
       masculine grace tops  the  overall  hierarchy  of  desirable
       traits	in  the	 fierce	 gay  competition  of  good  looks.
       Handsome	Rs often sense this pecking order, and feeds  their
       egos  while  hardening  their disdain for Qs, especially	the
       effeminate ones.	...
       ""Many Qs	may learn from necessity to refocus their libido on
       fellow Qs. ...
       ""For it is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after	the
       R  as  sexual object, they may also resent and reject him as
       social  companion!   There  are	several	 reasons  for  this
       rejections. 'Sour grapes' is an understandable reaction from
       those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
       have  defensively  fashioned  a	lifestyle  out	of peculiar
       individualism are bound to resent (and perhaps envy  just  a
       little)	those  gays  who can and do successfully conform to
       straight	standards. ...	There is more to  Q/R  estrangement
       than just these problems.
       ""For one	thing, if the handsome all-American straight boy is
       the  ultimate  sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-
       type homosexual must appear as a	ghostly	mock-up	of the real
       thing. ...
       ""Further, Rs are	 still	more  upsetting	 to  those  Qs	who
       believe	that  'butch'  behavior	is just	an unnatural put-on
       for gays. ...  Just as the anti-conformity of Qs	baffles	Rs,
       the ease	with which Rs conform to the mainstream	may be hard
       for Qs to understand. ...  Hence, Qs  may  misinterpret	the
       Rs' ingrained disinclination to gayified	behavior, and label
       it homophobia. ...

       Qs have risen to	political leadership and brotherhood in	the

       Extreme Qs, as a	group, may rate	below Rs on the	sociosexual
       hierarchy,  but they can	and do rank above them on the scale
       of political power in the gay world.
       ""In  the	 meantime,  reticent  Rs,  who	benefit	 from	the

       they  achieve  personal	acceptability in the right straight

       suspect that it is mainly Qs who	organize the gay community,
       set its norms, and decide which of  its	collective  efforts
       are  PC	['politically  correct'].  PC initiatives are those
       which the gay leadership	and press deem to be good  for	the
       gay  community  as  a whole.  And the mobilization of the R-
       type subgroup, it turns out,  is	 definitely  not  PC  -	 at
       least, not in Boston.  Let us give you an example.
       ""Several	years ago, a handful of	 young	men  in	 that  city
       attempted   to  start  an  organization	which  would  bring
       together	self-perceived	Rs  for	 social	 activities.   They
       posted  two  short announcements	in college and local papers
       with the	 headline,  'STRAIGHT  GAYS.'  The  leaders  rather
       crudely	hinted	that this new club would be for	those young
       gays 'not  entirely  comfortable	 with  the  glittering	bar
       crowd.'	One  of	 the  authors  attending the organization's
       first meeting.  He found	the room packed	 with  excited	and
       grateful	 Rs,  who immediately set about	the organization of
       the  club  activities  ranging  from  baseball	to   opera-
       listening.   The	only qualification for membership was self-
       selection according  to	the  understood	 character  of	the
       organization,  and  its	aims  remained	social	rather than
       political. ...  Within weeks, the club was regularly drawing
       to its meetings between one and two hundred members - making
       it one of the most active gay groups  in	 Boston.  ...	Its
       leaders likened the group to the	gay clubs designed to bring
       together	men with  other	 special  interests,  such  as	the
       black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite, or 'man/boy love'
       societies in town.
       ""Boston's  gay  leadership  did	not  buy  the	comparison,
       however.	  There	was evident suspicion and resentment (based
       some part, no doubt, on envy) at	the prospect  of  'student-
       aged'   all-American   Rs   cloistering	 exclusively  among
       themselves for social and sexual	companionship.	A local	gay
       newspaper  attacked  the	group openly for its supposed macho
       snobbery	and for	the 'closet cases' it  seemed  to  nurture.
       ...    The   organization's  leaders  protested	that  their
       intentions had been misunderstood  (although,  in  a  sense,
       they   have  been  all-to-clearly  understood  -	 and  found
       politically incorrect).	But eventually they  bowed  to	the
       pressure.   Over	 two  years  they  gradually phased out	the
       stress upon 'straight gays.'  The  criticism  from  the	gay
       community  stopped  coming.  Alas, so did the group's R-type
       members.	 Having	lost  its  distinctive	drawing	 card,	the
       entire  operation  fizzled.   It	 had  failed the test of PC
       administered by the Q-oriented community. ...
       ""And there is a final twist in the Q/R cold  war	 which	may
       impede  the  growth of gay rights from time to time.  R-type
       gays are	the ones who actually succeed in slipping into	the
       circles	of mainstream political	power in America.  So it is
       a sad irony that	confidential liaisons between uptight Rs in
       government  and	Qs heading the gay activist movement can be
       further	strained  by  the   R's	  basic	  alienation   form
       unconventional Qs in general. ...
       ""This  analysis	has  found  the	 gay  world  troubled	and
       handicapped by the mutual alienation of Qs and Rs.  It is PC
       to deny this split. ...	First, we must abandon PC myths	and
       admit  that  the	 split	exists.	 Second, we must understand
       clearly the root	cause of the Q/R cold  war.   Someone  once
       called  it  'oppression	sickness':  each outgroup member is
       ill-at-ease with	himself, and is	frustrated  by	his  forced
       companions,  because the	social mainstream imposes pressures
       and expectations	which he feels that  he	 cannot	 meet,	and
       because	his  companions	 remind	him of his own failure.	 So
       the more	progress we can	make toward  social  acceptance	 in
       the  straight world for gays as a whole,	the less tension we
       will see	between	groups within the gay world. ...
       ""In the meantime, the gay  community  should  recognize	the
       distinct	identity and special problems of R-type	homosexuals
       - and could begin by expanding the aegis	of PC tolerance	 to
       include R-type organizations.

two polar categories of gay men, based on how they were able to
conform in youth and how they accepted ""gayified"" behavior in adulthood.
Things don't seem that clear cut to me for several reasons:
The first reason is that I wouldn't know whether to classify myself as
a Q or R. On one hand, much of ""gayified"" behavior and style really
turns me off. Just as the authors say of R's, my reaction OFTEN
is ""Why would someone want to appear that way?"" On the other hand,
I don't shun the gay ghetto and, like Q's, I suspect that a gay man
who does so suffers from internalized homophobia. In my childhood,
I was an unathletic sissy. I could not conform, but unlike the author's
description of Q youths, I did not turn non-conformity into anti-conformity.
Instead I deeply wished I could conform.
The second reason is that I often meet ""gayified"" gay men who DID
conform in their youth. They were athletic, they joined a fraternity,
etc. And now as adults they conform within the gay ghetto. Because of
their conformity to some ""gayified"" style, if I had to classify them
as Q's or R's, I would chose Q's. They OFTEN aren't particularly
effeminate, but rather ""masculine"" clone types, who are on one of the
gay bar's softball teams in the gay softball league, who go out
to gay discos on the weekend (at least prior to the epidemic), and in
general, seem to keep their social life restricted pretty much to the
gay ghetto.
The third reason has to do with gay self-hatred. The authors say that R's
put a premium on straight appearance because they were
able to conform and reap the benefits of conformity during their youth.
The authors explain the R's dislike of gayified behavior as
inability to appreciate why Q's lean towards anti-conformity.
The authors claim that the Q's view this dislike as gay self-hatred,
and that the Q's are merely un-understanding of the R's premium on
conformity. I strongly disagree. There is quite a bit of ""R-like""
behavior that IS motivated by homophobia, although it would be
difficult to ascertain how much of this dislike of various
""gayified"" behavior comes from homophobia.
But on the other hand, a lot of what the authors say rings true.
I think that this is so because what they describe are not two
types of gay PERSONS, but rather two DYNAMICS IN OUR PERSONALITIES.
I see both the ""R"" dynamic and the ""Q"" dynamic at work in my own
personality, in my own style, and in the personalities and styles
of my gay male friends. Furthermore, most gay men I meet show quite
a mixture of these two dynamics. As for the way I ""categorize"" (or not)
myself, I do not think of myself as a gayified gay or as a ""straight""
gay, but as a Rob-Bernardo-gay (or as a just plain Rob-Bernardo). I often
feel very critical of gay men who have moved to San Francisco and
gotten too GHETTOIZED. They seem to have lost their individuality
in conforming to the gay ghetto. But that's another posting to net.motss.
So, what I think the authors missed is that conformity in youth
can lead to conformity to the gay ghetto in adulthood, and that
some dislike for gayified behavior is due to homophobia.","GilhGtHFa8wJ",23,1985-11-23,-11,10

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

Working in the New York Blood Center, I read net.med & net.motss because
I'm curious as to what people are saying about AIDS. The above article
implies that there is a shift in the AIDS risk group. I just thought I'd
share the something with the folks in this group.

on AIDS about a month ago & passed out some literature the Blood Program 
put together & this is how the stats on risk groups go:

       Heterosexual Contracts of Above Groups   130       ( 1%)
       Child with parents with AIDS

Steve on several occasions in the past you have strongly suggested that 
we ignore Ken Arndt, and that any kind of reply only makes him worst.
Well I feel that I expressed myself quite plainly in net.flame and also that
I got through to Ken in recent personal mail ...
as evidence I copy the following from Kens recent posting in net.motss.
along with some comments of my own!
I know that Ken's postings are offensive, juvenile, and sickening. But in all
reality Kens attitudes are typical of lots of people, people who are frightened and threatened by our very existence. Ken is just more persistent and more
insensitive than most. We are gonna have to be able to take on people like Ken 
and we are gonna have to be able to talk directly to this kind of nonsense,
or crawl back into the shadows, mayby forever this time.
Ignoring Ken Arndt is not gonna make him go away, and I personally believe
that Its wrong to try and censor him... (I know that I have expressed a 
different view before, and Ive changed my mind. )

Clearly Ken is still indulging in his inimitable style of what he considers wit.
But I also feel that we have here the first glimmerings of the REAL KEN ARNDT..
How many closet cases have we all seen who are convinced that if they do not remain vigilant in their attacks on ""Those homo's"" then their whole line of defense
will fall apart and they will be swept away by the urges within that keep them
living in a purgatorial pit of guilt and sensuous fantasy. An aquaintance once
told me that his biggest fear about going to Gay bars or Mens groups, was that 
he was convinced he would be jumped by all these letcherous faggots, his pants 
pulled down and his macho honor destroyed forever. The reality was that it 
never happened, and he had to face that in actuality he was disappointed.

Here Ken shows off his mysoginistic tendencys in such a way that no comment is 
necessary.

And here it is ... the first signs that Ken is gonna get REAL with us..

(Just for grins Ken I think most of us motss'ers would object to being pigeon
holed into Rays world view.. no offence Ray but I know I don't relate to your
stuff).
This is a very Bold and revealing move on Kens part, he is telling us a lot 
with this paragraph, and it comes from very deep levels of his psyche...
He admits to masturbating, now don't take this lightly many more wordly types
cannot make even this small step towards self-understanding. He also tells us
that he found masturbation unfulfilling,in the same paragraph we are told why.

It is a great pity that so many are unaware that its ok to do something nice and
sexual with and for yourself. 
Kens backhanded comment about how he Loves ALL women EQUALLY (and not really
saying how little that is) reveals the anger he feels about having to expend
his love on them instead of being able to keep it for himself.
  >Well, I feel the same way about homosexuality as I do about masturbation.  It
  >falls short of what sex is all about.
Here is a very interesting statement, since Ken has already admitted to being
a masturbator (at least some time in his life)
and is stating here that he feels the same way about homosexuality as 
masturbation
Can we have a pause to wonder if Ken is making this judgement based on personal
experience. After all he is saying ""It falls short of what sex is all about""
this sure sounds like a firm belief based on real life experience to me.
Interestingly enough it is very common for first sexual experinces to be 
absolutly dreadfull for most people. I know that my first Adult encounter with
Gay sex was so traumatic that its a wonder that I ever tried it a second time!

AAHHHHHH now we are getting rightin there to the root of Kens festering painfull
feelings..
First of all ""the Homosexuals"" have forced Ken to spend so much time and 
emotional energy preaching to these filthy buggerers because they ""tout""
an alternative lifestyle and even insist on being given basic human rights 
Ken almost see's daylight when he admits that what he is in opposition to
is merely his VIEW of Gay peoples lack of understanding about ""what sex is all
about"", and and that he THINKS we are are actually anti-sex. (Better watch out
Ken these are weaknesses that I'm sure the I.C. chaplain will find disturbing)
But of course he redeems himself by flatly proclaiming our sexual behaviour as
self-destructive.

Well let me 'splain it to you Ken.... In the first place some people like
mutual masturbation, in fact some people like it to the exclusion of just about anything else.And when the participants al have the same (or at least similar)
equipment there is hardly a limit of two individuals. As to having a problem 
about where to put ""it"" (I will assume that you mean your penis) I don't know
what barns you hang out behind, but where I grew up ....NOBODY... ever had
any trouble finding a good place to put ""it"".

NO... Ken ... its not really hate.. its presumptuous....
the WAY you say it is hatefull, and often cruel.
Your analogy is seriously flawed right up front because  you call Gay sex
a pretension to human sexual fulfillment, this is a matter that is necesarily
the domain of the individual. It is not your place to judge whether anyone else
is fulfilled or not, no matter what you may personally think of the behavior
in question. I recognise that there are many individuals who do not find
same sex partnerships to be sexually fulfilling, but your protestations
not withstanding Ken, there are some individuals who do.
And thats a FACT..............

have been just as bitter before we gave up the fight.

America great...
Since you've asked why we protest at what you've said after you call us 
pretentious perverts,flagrant touters of death dealing un-natural sexual
self gratification,comedic perpetrators of self destructive immoral anti-sex,
mutually masturbating merchants of loneliness, and worst, I'll tell you.
Its because you stick your ill-informed bigotted nonsense out where every
body can see how silly it is, and you have been unnecesarilly cruel and 
persistent in your terrorism (there I said it again) of this newsgroup.
You know that you come here to motss in order to stir up shit ;-)
you enjoy the attention, we aren't fooled by your claims of an evangelical
mission to save our worthless and unfulfilled lives. Besides this isn't a
protest over what you say , this is an opportunity to squarely face  the
kind of bigotry and fearfull anger breeding homophobia that every Gay 
person has had to deal with every day of their lives.

Once again proving that Ken is an agent of the international banking conspiracy
exhorting us all to self enslavement by the charge card Barons of the

So in closing I hope that Ken will see it clear to continue this revealing
and stimulating dialogue..
And I hope that all you degenerates out there will be gentle with ole Ken
when he eventually cums around to his senses and turns the other cheek...;-)

Shame, shame, shame on you people for goading Ken in private messages.
Unfortunately, this generally overstimulates him, leading to another message
of the form we've just seen.  
Unless you enjoy ""when are you going to stop beating your wife"" arguments,

I would be interested in a proof on how gay sexual behaviour is self-
destructive. I engage in it with my lover, and I have found that it is
constructive; the physical act is only one aspect of it. I guess I don't
believe in sex, only making love. A bonding occurs (or should, in my
opinion) when such an act is performed. I'm afraid that Mr. Ardnt is the
one who seems to lack understanding of what the act is all about.
He also evidences a lack of understanding in what exactly occurs in
homosexual acts.

I'd be interested in a proof demonstrating that it is a perversion. Such 
behaviour occurs elsewhere in nature (it's been observed in marine mammals
and avian species among other). And who is he to say what sexual fulfilment
(or fulfullment, as he says)is anyway? What may be fulfilling for him may not
be for others. I'm afraid Mr. Ardnt lack the quality of empathy.

Again, can he prove his assertion? Anal intercourse is not the only way to
communicate the disease, and it may not be the only factor. The condition
of the immune system at the time the virus is introduced to the body may
be a factor as well.
Mr. Ardnt makes many assertions, but I think the proof for the, if it exists,
is flimsy at best. It is nice to see something written by him which is
halfway decent though. That's nice.","g9t8pGWN0fIJ",2,1985-11-16,11,25

only chaste kisses and ""supportive"" embracing, and for god's sake don't

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

Mark, if you had been following the discussion concerning sign language, you 
would know that there are derogatory signs for gays and lesbians.  
This person was only curious if there were similar signs for straight 
people; she/he was not being anti-heterosexual.  Stop being so defensive!
No, calling straight people names is not the most mature response that
gays and lesbians can muster, but you have to keep in mind that many
straight people are oppressive threats to our health and well-being
(some gay and bisexual people are probably threats to our well-being,
as well). Calling straight people ""breeders"" is a harmless, childish
way to vent steam. I don't condone it, but worse evils demand my

Are you referring to effeminacy in gay men?  Are you referring to 
masculine traits in lesbians?  Are you saying that all gays and 
lesbians ""pose""?   How can you be so sure if it is a pose or if it is 
actually the way the person was meant to act?  Or, are you opposed to 
gay men acting different from straight men, lesbians acting different 
from straight women?
There is a school of gay thought that says that gay people *are* 
different.  We are the same as straights in our humanity, but different 
in our expression of that humanity.  Since we break societal mating 
norms, we are free to experiment with the male/female role 
models.  Hence, we have formed a distinct gay/lesbian subculture.  You 
can even make a good argument for a gay male subculture distinct from 
a lesbian subculture.
What's the matter, Mark, do our differences bother you?  If you are 
unable to celebrate differences, then you can concentrate on the many 
things that straight people, and gays and lesbians have in common.
> Anyhoo, the whole message is let's stop this differentiation on meaninless

Gee, if you want to treat everyone the same, why shouldn't we stop the 
differentiation between gay ""posers"" and ""masculine"" gay men, between 
""butch"" lesbians and ""feminine"" lesbians.  Why can't we celebrate 
these differences, or will celebrating these differences in gays and 
lesbians cause straight people to question their own male/female role 
models?
Just throwing out a few ideas.  Maybe someone else can take them and 
run with them...

Consider  how  a  surgeon  prepares  for  surgery.   Thorough  scrub   with

This brings up some questions which, as a regular blood donor, not in a
high risk group, have occurred to me.  I know that the blood banks are now 
testing donor blood.  I can see the reason for that.  However, the test is 
often wrong.
If my blood tests positive, will they inform me about it?  If so, how?
Who else will be informed?  (An especially interesting question--since
I give through a program at work.) Must I pay for the extra tests to confirm 
or invalidate their positive test?  It seems to me that if their test was 
mistaken, I shouldn't be made to pay. (Beyond being scared shitless, of 
course!  I have visions of thousands of people sueing them for pain and 
suffering.)  Suppose I test false positive--can I be reinstated as a blood 
donor when the incorrectness of their test is confirmed?  I would like to 
give blood if possible--but if they don't want my blood, even for an invalid 
reason, do I have any recourse?  Or, if they act badly, should I even care?
As an aside, it seems to me that there are some issues connected with these
tests on which straights, (or bi's like me) should really be siding with
the gay community--like who gets told about your positive test, and how
society treats you (i.e. keeping you out of school or work).  Obviously,
given the information quoted, this could happen to anyone.  And it is most
likely, with a false positive, to happen to those people who care about
others enough to give blood since they will be tested often.  Given the 
irrational, lynching attitude I've seen, this could really mess up a person's 
life.  And of course, it's even worse with a true positive, because you need 
support even more in that situation.  But I don't see people caring.  I 
wonder how many people will have to be hurt before people do care.  Sigh.

Recent reading: Harper's for October has a panel discussion on AIDS that
is one of the most coherent and intelligent presentations on the subject
I can remember seeing in the media over the past several months.
Some quotes:
Gary McDonald (AIDS Action Council): ``Look, I think the moment may have
arrived to desexualize this disease.  AIDS is not a ``gay disease,''
despite its epidemiology.  Yet we homosexualize it, and by doing so end
up posing the wrong questions.  There is no evidence to support the
notion that gay men in general are immunocompromised because they engage
in anal intercourse, despite the fact that semen itself may be immuno-
suppresive in some circumstances.  And gay men have been doing this for
centuries with no dire consequences.''
Mervyn Silverman (a consultant) (no joke): ``... And there are certainly
erotic and exciting sexual activities that do not entail an exchange of
body fluids.  Use your imagination.''
Ann Giudici Fettner (New York Native): ``Use your imagination?  What
kind of educational message is that?''
Mathew Shebar (Gay Men's Health Crisis): ``Margaret Heckler ... I call
her the secretary of health and heterosexual services.''
Along (alas) lines more typical of the media of the Republic, the
magazine New York for the 7th inst. purports to bear within its pages
``The Last Word on Avoiding AIDS''.  Some good material---a little
better than the Enquirer's coverage---particularly with regard to
catching the disease through casual contact.  On the other hand, as soon
as New York enters the bedroom things go a little haywire.  There are a
few choice nuggets: a sidebar labelled THE NEW SEXUAL ETIQUETTE advises:
``If you're a single woman, remember---no casual sex ever again,'' says
one expert. ``Know your partner.  Know whether he ever had a homosexual
experience or used injected drugs in the past eight years.''
One unworthy identified only as ``Kaplan of the Human Sexuality Program
at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center'' [ I assume he wears a
trenchcoat and introduces himself as ``Kaplan of the Center'' ] refers
to ``these high-risk people, these Typhoid Marys''.  It's possible he
meant this as a dish.  If he did, this is the only dish in the article.
The magazine is hardly worth dashing out and buying for the article in
question.  I myself bought it to get the show times for ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom'', a play which sounds oddly like the Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes remade for the Village.  A report of which, subject to
its intrinsic merit, the availability of tickets, and the fickle whims
of my fair traveling companion, may be forthcoming...

Thanks for bringing up the _Harper's_ article.  I've read it, and
excerpted it for some of the locals here at Sun.  It really *is* one
of the very best articles on AIDS that I have read.
I would also recommend to all readers of motss and your friends two
other magazines (both October issues): _The Atlantic_, and _The New
Republic_.  The _Atlantic_ article is labelled as ""How San Francisco
Coped [sic] with AIDS;"" the _New Republic_ article is titled
""AFRAIDS.""  Both are very sane, intelligent, informed articles on the
subject.  I can't say strongly enough that every person of whatever
sexual preference who has had more that one sexual partner since 1981
should read these articles (all three).  The _Harper's_ article is
especially good, in that it describes in great detail the history of
the disease, what the ""clinical"" meaning of the term is, and describes
how the retrovirus LAV/HTLV-II works.  It also discusses some issues
of burning concern to all oppressed people--like mass quarantine and
public policy.  The _ATlantic_ article spends much of its time
discussing how AIDS has affected San Francisco, and how it has shaped
recent public policy in SFO.  But it also discusses how it affects the
lives of the people who it touches.  There have also been recent
editorial articles on AIDS in the British news weekly _The Economist_.
I don't remember the issue dates, but I'm sure that there will be more
in the future.  _The Economist's_ articles give a uniquee will be more
in the future.  _The Economist's_ articles give a unique, European
perspective, that is quite intelligent.  I think they have the benefit
of distance from the tragedy to help them.  In any case, it appears
that the ""serious"" press has started to get serious now.  It burns me
up,though, that it took school children and Rock Hudson to get their
attention.

justification was that it would be unfair to those who did release results if
they provided coverage to others who didn't.  Since they were prohibited from
denying coverage on the basis of test results or lack thereof, they decided to
eliminate all coverage.  This strikes me as a rather vindictive move, but it
shows that perhaps simply legislating restrictions on the insurance companies
may not be the answer.  Have you ever tried to get insurance which covers

  ...If the test proves positive the first time, it will be held so it
doesn't get used for transfusion.  It will be re-tested a number of times
and if the results are still positive, the blood will be sent to the
Red Cross's central laboratory for further tests.
  If those tests are positive, donors will be informed that for an
un-specified reason, their blood cannot be used and no further donations
will be accepted.
  The Red Cross will then ask the donor to name a physician to send test

For those of you not fortunate enough to live within his zone of
syndication, Arthur Hoppe is the political satirist in the San
Francisco Chronicle. He is usually on target & quite funny, but
sometimes (esp. lately) his sense of humor flags with his reaction
to the world around him. Unannounced & unpermitted, I forward for 
your examination his column for today (10Sep). I DO hope that only
ONE copy of this shows up at any given site & that it's legible;
this editor & I have had to throw away 3 of these already!!
""The New Lepers""
It was at a party. I had filled my glass at the bar and turned. Behind
me was a middle-aged man I had known for several years. I don't know
him well. We had talked several times. He is a gentle, soft-spoken
soul and I like him.
A month or so ago, I heard he had AIDS. I thought of calling or writing
him, but what do you say? And now here he was. He held out his hand. For
a fraction of a second, I involuntarily hesitated. Then, of course, I 
shook it.
If he does have AIDS, I can only pray that he didn't notice that flicker
of hesitation. I am deeply ashamed of it. I can think of nothing more
dishonorable than to fail to offer your hand to a dying man.
Only the day before, a dear friend who is a reasonable sort demanded to
know why ""the newspapers didn't print the truth about AIDS"" - primarily
about what a danger AIDS poses to the middle-class heterosexual community.
""I was at dinner the other night and we spent at least an hour talking
about nothing else,"" he said, and there was a hint of fear and anger
in his voice.
I tried to tell him that for the last couple of years newspapers have
gone out of their way to publish stories about AIDS and their message was
precisely the opposite: every recorded case of AIDS has been the result
of the virus being transmitted into the bloodstream either by contaminated
blood or contaminated semen. There is no other known way to contract the
disease.
I don't think he heard me. I don't think people are listening. I think
they are too unreasonably scared.
""The food's good,"" said a woman I know, talking about a restaurant she no
longer frequents because many of the waiters are gay, ""but why take chances?""
""My heart goes out to him,"" a mother was quoted as saying in a news story
about a young pupil who had AIDS, ""but I wouldn't feel right letting my
child be in his classroom.""
In San Francisco, city officials denounced as ""a cruel hoax"" notices
falsely claiming that AIDS patients would be quarantined in remote loca-
tions. Yet at least some gays took it seriously.
And rightly so. From most reports, gays are being increasingly evicted,
fired and ostracized as the disease spreads increasingly among them and
the heterosexual community becomes increasingly frightened.
It's no wonder gays refuse to give their names when taking tests for AIDS.
If I were gay, I wouldn't want my name on any list. There's not much harm
now, but if no cure is found and if the disease and the fear continue their
exponential growth...
I keep thinking about leprosy. We used to ring bells and shout, ""Unclean!""
when we saw a leper coming, or lock them up in deplorable colonies for the
rest of their lives. We knew that their very touch would make us lepers too.
Today, we have learned that leprosy is transmitted only through prolonged,
intimate exposure. We now call it ""Hansen's disease"" and treat its victims
as out-patients. They walk among us posing no more danger than a stranger
with AIDS.
I like to believe that the human race is getting better over the millenia.
Aftr all, that hope is our only chance of survival in a nuclear age. So 
I can only pray that we react more reasonably to an unreasonable fear this
time around.
Thus I'm afraid - not of AIDS, but of our reaction to it. Your reaction and
mine. And if a dying friend of mine reads this, I hope he will forgive me.
I'd like to shake his hand.

question to be asking.  None of the available evidence about AIDS
contradicts the assumption that all it takes is a SINGLE exposure through
an appropriate vector, quite independent of the supposed state of one's
immune system.  The early people who got AIDS didn't necessarily succumb
because of late nights at the disco and lots of poppers--they got it
because they were sufficiently promiscuous that their chances of coming
across an infected person was very high.  Now that HTLV-3 antibodies can be
found in a significant percentage of gay men, at least in certain cities
like NY, SF and LA, it is simply imprudent, if not suicidally foolish, to
indulge in ""unsafe sex"" practices, even if you meet ""Mr. Wonderful"" today
and pledge monogamy thereon.
Sure, take care of yourself, get enough rest, and take Geritol.
But don't let that substitute for the simplest and most effective
methods of avoiding exposure to the virus.

personas most familiar to the straight world: the pomaded and permed 'fem',
the titanic leather master, the	clipped	clone, the _ G_ Q hyperboy,	and others.
...  Qs	are outwardly _ g_ a_ y_ i_ f_ i_ e_ d;	 they  have  bought  into  strict  outgroup
stereotypes  which,  whether  screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
constitute a burlesque of gender roles.	 Qs think of themselves	as  visible
gays, and tend to make such a profile central to their ego structure. ...
""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,	and  Qs	 are  perhaps  more
likely	than  Rs  to  be  drawn	 toward	 the asylum of gay ghettos in urban
centers. ...
""Whereas Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and so  did,  many	 Qs
felt that, for whatever	reasons, they could not	conform	during their youth,
and so	did  not.   Those  reasons  might  include  passivity,	effeminacy,
homeliness,  remarkable	 prettiness,  lack of athletic skill, or almost	any
other cause for	unpopularity among male	youth.	At first,  evidently,  many
Qs  were unhappy loners	who salvaged their self-esteem by making a lodestar
virtue	out  of	 _ i_ n_ d_ i_ v_ i_ d_ u_ a_ l_ i_ s_ m	rather	than  peer  acceptance.	  But  non-
conformity engenders anti-conformism.  So some Qs went further and acquired
a taste	for outrageousness, actively calculating shock to others  in  order
to reinforce their social status as rebels with	a cause. ...
""As the	years go by, and they learn that  they	are  not  alone,  Qs  adopt
zealously  the	visible	 uniforms and credos of	their supporting outgroups.
...  Surveys have shown	that, for many Qs, camp	behavior is a passing phase
of overt defiance, toned down in later years.
""When those gays who boast R-status meet those who defend  Q-status,  there
can  be	 trouble.   First, let's look at things	for the	viewpoint of the R.
For one	thing, the sexual objects of Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs,  for	the
most  part  are	scorned. ...  It is the	'fem' [from among the variety of Q-
type personas] who bears the brunt of the invective from Rs. ...
""[Gay] bars are	often regarded by Rs as	the bastions of	self-segregated	 Qs
-  branded  as twinkie bars, leather bars, etc.	- and so may be	viewed with
distaste. ...
""We should mention at this point that those Rs who shun	the  bars  find	 it
more  difficult	 to lead satisfactory sex lives.  They have trouble meeting
other Rs because, unlike visible Qs, out in the	straight world most Rs have
banished  any  tell-tale  signals  of  homosexuality  from their conformist
uniforms and are wary of mistaken self-exposures. ...
""To make sexual	matters	still more difficult for many  Rs,  they  face	two
more  unique  dilemmas.	 ...  First, ... a Q may be drawn to, and satisfied
by, a relationship with	an acceptably masculine	R.  But	what of	the classic
R-type	-  the 'all-American boy' whose	only felt shortcoming is his sexual
preference?  For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual object  possessing	the
one  feature he	feels he lacks and wishes to capture - may very	well be	the
straight boy, who is, by definition, unattainable. ...
""The second sexual dilemma faced by Rs	involves  the  ritual  of  sex-play
itself.	  For at least some Rs,	it seems, masculine _ r_ o_ l_ e _ p_ e_ r_ f_ o_ r_ m_ a_ n_ c_ e is	the
most thrilling part of sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened  in	 homosexual
practices such as passive anal sex or active fellatio. ...
""But even if the R is contentedly 'out'	to family and  friends,	 and  self-
exposure is not	an issue, he may still dislike Qs for two related reasons.
""First,	because	the R has typically conformed with ease	to the	mainstream,
the  exaggerated  outgroup displays of Qs simply _ b_ a_ f_ f_ l_ e	him.  Why would	any
person _ c_ h_ o_ o_ s_ e to draw such public ridicule and abuse, he wonders?  ...	 'I
don't  see why they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
[we interviewed].  'It obviously looks phony and fools no  one.'  At  best,
then,  many Rs come to view Qs the way that many straights view	homosexuals
_ e_ n _ b_ l_ o_ c, as somehow foolish and	trivial, a nationality of sterile  cuckoos.
...
""Second, Qs do more than baffle	Rs - they also _ i_ r_ r_ i_ t_ a_ t_ e	Rs terribly,  to  a
degree	that  more  detached  straights	cannot understand.  Many Rs plainly
resent being identified	with the Qs, and blame them for	the  weird  profile
of homosexuals as a whole. ...
""Like most gay males, it seems,	even exotic Qs hear the	siren call  of	the
rutting	R.  And	so relations between Qs	and Rs grow still more tense.
""It is our impression that, for	_ b_ o_ t_ h Rs	and Qs,	archetypal Rs the 'idols of
the  tribe.'  It  is  the  R whose natural masculine grace tops	the overall
hierarchy of desirable traits in the fierce gay	competition of good  looks.
Handsome  Rs  often  sense  this  pecking order, and feeds their egos while
hardening their	disdain	for Qs,	especially the effeminate ones.	...
""Many Qs may learn from	necessity to refocus their libido on fellow Qs.	...
""For it	is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after the  R	 as  sexual
object,	they may also resent and reject	him as social companion!  There	are
several	reasons	for this rejections. 'Sour  grapes'  is	 an  understandable
reaction  from those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
have defensively fashioned a lifestyle out of  peculiar	 individualism	are
bound  to resent (and perhaps envy just	a little) those	gays who can and do
successfully conform to	straight standards.  ...   There  is  more  to	Q/R
estrangement than just these problems.
""For one thing,	if the handsome	all-American straight boy is  the  ultimate
sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-type homosexual must appear as
a ghostly mock-up of the real thing. ...
""Further, Rs are still more upsetting to those Qs who believe that  'butch'
behavior  is  just  an	unnatural  put-on  for gays. ...  Just as the anti-
conformity of Qs baffles  Rs,  the  ease  with	which  Rs  conform  to	the
mainstream   may  be  hard  for	 Qs  to	 understand.  ...   Hence,  Qs	may
misinterpret the Rs' ingrained disinclination  to  gayified  behavior,	and
label it homophobia. ...
""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type persona as	the  'true'
gay type, and hence feel like outsiders	within their own outgroup. ...
""How do	these tensions between Rs and  Qs  affect  the	social	structures,
political  institutions,  and  activist	 success  of the gay community?	...
Those who could	not hide have instead turned to	make  their  stand  against
oppression,  and  Qs  have risen to political leadership and brotherhood in
the activist movement across America.  This is to  their  credit.   Extreme
Qs,  as	 a  group, may rate below Rs on	the sociosexual	hierarchy, but they
can and	do rank	above them on the scale	 of  _ p_ o_ l_ i_ t_ i_ c_ a_ l	power  in  the	gay
world.
""In the	meantime, reticent Rs, who benefit from	the sacrifices	of  Qs	and
yet carp about their flamboyant	image in the straight world, have been able
to have	it both	ways: they achieve  personal  acceptability  in	 the  right
straight  world	 of  today,  while  relishing  the  progress  toward social
flexibility made on their behalf for  tomorrow.	  But  because	Rs  do	not
choose to play the activist game in great numbers, they	lose their ability,
as a group, to influence the rules of that game.
""Although the point is hard to prove with certainty, we	suspect	that it	 is
mainly	Qs  who	organize the gay community, set	its norms, and decide which
of its collective efforts are PC ['politically correct'].   PC	initiatives
are  those  which  the gay leadership and press	deem to	be good	for the	gay
community as a whole.  And the mobilization  of	 the  R-type  subgroup,	 it
turns out, is definitely _ n_ o_ t PC	- at least, not	in Boston.  Let	us give	you
an example.
""Several years ago, a handful of young men in that city	attempted to  start
an  organization  which	 would	bring together self-perceived Rs for social
activities.  They posted two  short  announcements  in	college	 and  local
papers	with  the  headline,  'STRAIGHT	 GAYS.'	 The leaders rather crudely
hinted that this new club would	be  for	 those	young  gays  'not  entirely
comfortable  with  the	glittering bar crowd.' One of the authors attending
the organization's first meeting.  He found the	room  packed  with  excited
and  grateful  Rs,  who	 immediately set about the organization	of the club
activities  ranging   from   baseball	to   opera-listening.	 The   only
qualification for membership was self-selection	according to the understood
character of the organization, and its aims  remained  social  rather  than
political.  ...	  Within  weeks,  the  club  was  regularly  drawing to	its
meetings between one and two hundred members - making it one  of  the  most
active	gay groups in Boston. ...  Its leaders likened the group to the	gay
clubs designed to bring	together men with other	special	interests, such	 as
the  black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite,	or 'man/boy love' societies
in town.
""Boston's gay leadership did not buy the comparison,  however.	 There	was
evident	 suspicion  and	 resentment (based some	part, no doubt,	on envy) at
the prospect of	 'student-aged'	 all-American  Rs  cloistering	exclusively
among  themselves  for	social	and  sexual  companionship.   A	 local	gay
newspaper attacked the group openly for	its supposed macho snobbery and	for
the  'closet  cases'  it seemed	to nurture. ...	 The organization's leaders
protested that their intentions	had  been  misunderstood  (although,  in  a
sense,	they  have  been  all-to-clearly understood - and found	politically
incorrect).  But eventually they bowed to the  pressure.   Over	 two  years
they  gradually	 phased	 out the stress	upon 'straight gays.' The criticism
from the gay community stopped coming.	Alas, so  did  the  group's  R-type
members.   Having  lost	 its distinctive drawing card, the entire operation
fizzled.  It had failed	the test  of  PC  administered	by  the	 Q-oriented
community. ...
""And there is a	final twist in the Q/R cold war	which may impede the growth
of  gay	 rights	 from  time to time.  R-type gays are the ones who actually
succeed	in slipping into the  circles  of  mainstream  political  power	 in
America.   So  it is a sad irony that confidential liaisons between uptight
Rs in government and Qs	heading	the gay	activist movement  can	be  further
strained by the	R's basic alienation form unconventional Qs in general.	...
""This analysis has found the gay world	troubled  and  handicapped  by	the
mutual	alienation  of Qs and Rs.  It is PC to deny this split.	...  First,
we must	abandon	PC myths and admit that	the split exists.  Second, we  must
understand clearly the root cause of the Q/R cold war.	Someone	once called
it  'oppression	 sickness':   each  outgroup  member  is  ill-at-ease  with
himself,  and  is  frustrated  by his forced companions, because the social
mainstream imposes pressures and expectations which he feels that he cannot
meet,  and  because  his  companions remind him	of his own failure.  So	the
more progress we can make toward social	acceptance in  the  straight  world
for gays as a whole, the less tension we will see between groups _ w_ i_ t_ h_ i_ n	the
gay world. ...
""In the	meantime, the gay community should recognize the distinct  identity
and  special  problems of R-type homosexuals - and could begin by expanding
the aegis of PC	tolerance to include R-type organizations.
""At the	same time, the community must also burn	off the	chaff  of  its	own
implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""

Ken, you should go to the Dr. and have your blood pressure and sugar
levels checked.  If that all checks out ok, have them do an EEG to
make certain there isn't a tumor.
All, please forgive my giving in to this.  I normally practice what I
preach: ""Treat the cause, not the symptom""; however, Mr. Arndt is a
very serious set of symptoms, and I fear for his health.  It is known
that such stress can lead to lessened disease resistance, and
ultimately defects in the Immune system...

the source. I belong to a gay support group and we try to have a movie night
once a month or so. So far all that I've been able to supply the group with
is ""Partners"" with Ryan O'Neil ""HBO America Undercover"" special on gays in
America ""Word is Out"" Documentary by 24 gay men and women ""Aids The First
Chapter"" a PBS Nova production ""Boys in the Band"" ""La Cage Aux Folles"" There
just aren't many films that portray us in a positive light.
    The two films I would like to get my hands on are ""A Very Natural Thing""
which was released ~~1974. The promotional poster showed two men playing in
the surf and the caption read ""The story of David and Jason, It's the same
only different"" I thought that the movie was very well made; depicting a young
preist leaving the monestary and coming out in N.Y.C. The other movie is
""Saturday Night at the Baths"">> no not a porno but the story of a (supposedly)
straight couple. The woman was a singer or piano player at the Continental
Baths in New York. The movie builds up to the point where her boyfriend ends
up going to bed with one of their gay friends who works at ther baths and
where their relationship goes from there. Has anyone seen these two movies
and how did you feel about them....where can I get them if you know?
   There are also a series of foreign films that the Advocate advertises. The
one that comes to mind is ""You are Not Alone"" Anybody seen any of these and
are they worth purchasing. I'm looking for any *GOOD* documentaries that 
would go over well at a gay rap/support group meeting. 
                                 Thanks in advance!

                               ***********
    An old friend and I sometimes reminisce about how things were way back
when we first came out in the very early 70's. Some of you who read this
newsgroup may have just recently come out and not remember the good/bad
old days. I have enjoyed the war stories that older gay men have shared
with me of their experiences in the ""Pre-Stonewall"" era; of having to hide,
being involved in bar raids by the vice squad, not having any role models
etc. They also felt that things were better in some ways; because they
shared a common oppression, the men they knew felt a tighter commradeship
than I see today. 
    When I first came out there were no gay newspapers in the Boston area
and I wasn't aware of the existance of ""Bob Damron's Guide"" On campus we
got free copies of ""Boston After Dark"" which later became the ""Phoenix""
Very hesitantly I answered a personal ad from a man who also attended the
same college as I. Larry introduced me to gay life; he was also the first
man I slept with. Larry took me to my first gay bar ""the Other Side"" in
Boston which closed years ago. It was a sleazy place where there was often
trouble with fag bashers and the police. I have to admit to being quite
excited on entering the bar, I was finally home; among others like me.
All the people Larry introduced me to ralleyed around me like old friends;
I was a new member in the fraternity and treated with love and respect.
    Very quickly Boston became my home away from home as I learned where
all the other gay men hung out; Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, The Combat
Zone, to name a few. This was long before the South End enjoyed the gen-
trification that gay pioneers started. There was the Charles Street Meet-
inghouse, a gay coffee house which was Boston's alternative to the bars.
    The bars were much more fun then, friendlier, full of life. Styx,
the 1270 and Cabaret After Dark became my playground. The one thing that
I recall was the lack of ""Attidude"" that prevails in the bars today. We
had to stick together in an atmosphere of opression. The first gay pride
parade I attended was festive, there wasn't the spectre of AIDS to deal
with. It was a day to be seen and celebrate our unity; we still do cel-
ebrate our strength but the parades seem somewhat angrier in recent years.
    There were other firsts I got to see; the first gay magazine that you
didn't have to buy in the Combat Zone, a black and white slick magazine
called ""Mandate"". It could be purchased in a few mainstream Boston book
shops and corner stores. In a lot of ways I liked the first Mandate much
more than what's out now. It had class, attractive models and lacked the
explicitness that Mandate and it's followers show in their centerfolds
today. 
    Back in my early years of coming out the worst worry I had was of may-
be getting rolled by a fag basher while leaving a bar. We would come and go
as a group; safety in numbers! Like a lot of other men back then, I had 
never heard of ""Safe Sex"" and induldged freely whenever I could. I was a 
real slut in my 20's and proud of it. Back then a shot of penicillin could
cure what ailed a guy. We're now faced with a lethal disease that has taken
away friends, family and lovers. Why didn't AIDS start claiming lives 20-
30-40 years ago? Was it a product of our liberation? I can't answer that
but it has certainly effected the way that we interact.
    There's another negative product I see which is an underlying attitude
of ""I don't need you"" As we've become more tolerated/accepted by mainstream
society there seems to be more of an aloofness toward each other; mostly in
bars and gay neighborhoods. Guys went out of their way to introduce them-
selves and be friendly way back then; at least to me. I was no beauty prize
winner then so it wasn't because I was some hot little chicken; matter of
fact friends see old pictures of me and say that I'm much more attractive now.
    So what's the bottom line to all my ramblings? I just feel that it was
more fun to be gay in the late 60's and early 70's. Have we in some ways
become a little jaded over time after fighting a long hard battle to gain
acceptance? I still try to approach new gay social situations with all the
enthusiasm I showed back in ""71"" but get met with apathy, attitude, etc.
So how much headway have we made; AIDS is here for a while, a conservative
political environment is taking some of our rights away; the child custoday
case that's in the news comes to mind, etc. So! we are still operating in
a stiffling world, we still need each other as much as in the Stonewall
era. Go out and shake a new hand, give someone new a big hug!

dancing at night, and I thought I'd report on the day for those not
fortunate enough to be here.
The day started out on a rather crushing note as my lover and I tried
to get downtown on the Muni metro system.  We finally managed to get
into the third train that went by; they were all jammed to the hilt
with people going to the parade.  We managed to get a good position,
right before traffic light for a cross street where they were letting
buses go through, so most of the groups had to stop and wait a bit.
The parade started off, as always, with Dykes on Bikes.  The group
must be growing, as I've never seen so many of them before.  They just
went on and on.  Various political figures followed (Lady DiFi, of
course, was not among them), followed by the contingents for the
various AIDS groups.  They got the biggest applause of the day, and I
wasn't alone in being a bit teary-eyed at that point.
I won't try to be inclusive, but these are some of the more memorable
moments:
Sistah Boom, a feminist political/samba group, really had the crowd
jumping.  I wanted one of the t-shirts several of them were wearing,
""Samba not bomba"".
Both the Gay Fathers and the Lesbian Mothers groups were quite popular
with the watchers.  The parents OF gays and lesbians group was also
warmly received.
Ducks on Trucks were an amusing counterpoint to some of the more
serious groups with their inflatable ducks and feather-covered truck.
The Gay Men's Chorus were all dressed in cute rainbow sailor caps and
had a ""carry"" (like a float, but the pieces were carried by the
marchers) of a ship.  They stopped and gave a rousing rendition of ""We
Sail the Ocean Blue"" from HMS Pinafore.
Several of the South-of-Market bars had floats liberally decorated with
scantily clad mouth-watering hunks.  (down, boy!)
The ALGA group (Association of Lesbian & Gay Asians) had the best drag;
most men look terrible in drag but several of them were even beautiful.
There were many men in various degrees of drag; the most spectacular
was in a costume that would have been at home in any show in Las Vegas.
It had a peacock feather headdress that reached several feet in the
air, and he was positively dripping with rhinestones.  Another guy was
dressed as a witch doctor, complete with horns, feathers, loin-cloth,
and an antlered wand.  Even the Foxy Lady women's wear shop in the
Mission had a float (apparently THE place to go to buy outrageous
clothes).
The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were quite festive in their
rainbow-colored habits.  And the Ladies Against Women had a sizeable
contingent, with their wonderful slogans:  ""I'd rather be ironing,""
""Protect the rights of the unconceived:  sperm are people too,""  ""Roses
not raises,"" and ""Suffering not sufferage.""
I became all choked up at a car bearing just a pillow with a tiara; it
was in memory of Fat Fairy by her friends in Oakland.
The watchers were almost as much fun to watch as the parade.  A pair of
men near us made quite a splash with their rainbow-striped hair.  At
one point a Chinese tourist came up and asked if this was the 4th of
July parade; she didn't seem to speak enough English to understand us
when we tried to explain what was going on.  One woman was watching the
parade bare-chested from atop a bus stop shelter.
As the parade ended, the crowd poured into the street to follow it to
the rally in Civic Center.  The speakers claimed that there were 300,000
people there.  Even given their usual penchant for exagerating, it was
quite exhilirating knowing that you were surrounded by hundreds of
thousands of gay people and their friends.  There was the inevitable
group of bible-thumpers alongside the parade route with their signs
foretelling doom to us all but, other than that, nothing but goodwill
from everyone.
(It was interesting conjecturing about the average straight San
Franciscan's response to the parade; probably something about those
damn faggots blocking off traffic all day.  But I digress.)
After going home to rest up for a while, we went to the party at the
Galleria to dance.  Either people are getting tired of these events or
we picked the wrong party:  there were only about 300-400 people there,
I'd guess.  The Weather Girls performed but the music was, on the
whole, not so great.  We enjoyed ourselves anyway and it was nice
having more than 3 square inches to dance in.
The rest of the day is none of your business.

 As I and those around me were admiring (for want of a better word) this
 creature, I overheard a man nearby ask his friend ""What is it?"". His
 friend, a hirsute, red-headed six-footer in a tasteful chiffon prom
 dress and white gloves, pondered a while and replied:
 ""It's faaabulous....whatever it is!""

You remember them, the lobby group that is credited with much of what happened
last election.  At least according to 60 minutes and Norman Lear and other
hysterical liberal types.  The people really didn't vote against the liberals,
they just didn't understand what they were doing - after all how COULD anyone
in their right mind vote against the liberal agenda - and that was because
'radical right wing groups' like Christian Voice fogged the issues.
Of course it's about AIDS.  As you read the quotes below please keep in mind
what I said about Jerry.  These folks are not adverse to puttin' you away!!
""A San Francisco newspaper - Thursday, October 18, 1984 - report said that 53%
of homosexuals are carriers of the virus that causes AIDS -- according to the
homosexuals' own figures that means there are over 10 million AIDS carriers!""
""We can't sit back and hope and pray for some public action to be taken.  We
have got to be safe in hospitals, restaurants, and public places.  Researchers
beleive AIDS can even be spread by saliva and perhaps just by  constant
exposure.""
""Our children deserve a school free from this dreaded communicable disease.""
""We are not trying to hurt homosexuals or lock them away from the rest of the
public . . . but we are serious about protecting ourselves from the ravages of
diseases started and passed on by homosexuals.""
""This is not un-Christian but responsible.  And we intend fro our government
to take this responsibility to the public.""
""But first we must rally massive public pressure.  Our government has acknowledged the threat of this plague by spending $100,000,000 on research for a cure --
coming up with little or nothing.  Why then won't the government spend 10 cents
to tell us how to protect ourselves.  IF WE CAN'T ISOLATE THE DISEASE, WE MUST
ISOLATE THE DISEASE SPREADERS. (italics theirs)""
**************
Now you can see the not quite accurate statements made above.  You know, the
way anti-Christian speakers (some homosexuals included, right?) address the
beliefs and actions of Christians.
The point I'm making is that people ARE starting to take action and get upset
and is that the smell of panic in the air??  Remember this little letter I
received goes to MILLIONS of American homes!!!!  These people have a network
like you wouldn't believe!  And in light of the way the dems are dumpin' the
homosexuals and other 'non-traditional' groups and movin' to the right (even
ole Tubby Teddy for cryin' out loud!) it doesn't look like a fun time ahead.
A few more years of exponential growth of AIDS and hey presto, ""SOMEBODY DO
SOMETHING BEFORE MY KIDS GET SICK!!!""  I'd like to hear some ideas from you
guys besides, ""I'm not spreadin' AIDS."", etc.  I'm not at all sure WHAT you
can do.  But ONE thing you can do is exercise some common sense in attending
those wonderful 'GAY Pride' marches - dump the geeks that are such an affront
to the public taste and those who actually ATTACK the moral values of the
majority (Sister Boom Boom, etc.).  I mean, it doesn't take much thought to
see making fun of someone's cherished beliefs makes for bad feelings.  And I
think you guys and gals will need all the friends you can muster over the next
few years.  My point about Jerry!  Don't be fooled by the circle of friends 
and workers, etc who are all 'feel good' and 'modern' about homosexuality.
I can see them turning on you if the rubber meets the road.  Yuppies are NOT
the wave of the future!  One of these days the banks will call in their debt
and they'll be Yuppies no longer.  (They, as a group, have one of the highest
debt rates.)
People are going to stop patronizing restaurants with 'gay' waiters, etc.
Will there be posters in Rest Rooms diagraming how to exit the stalls using
only your elbows??
Yea, yea the kids poll in favor of leaving the homosexuals alone.  But will
it be the same when they grow up??  Where are the radicals of the '60's now?
Isn't Jerry Rubin working on Wall Street?  Is there really a change in the
weather vis a vis morals?  Are people getting fed up with the 'anything goes'
stuff?  Religion is MORE popular with he folks today than it was in the decades
past!  It's GROWING!!!  And it's no secret what organized religion thinks about
homosexuality.  And don't believe that merde about politics and religion don't
mix.  We ALL know better!  Just ask William Sloan Coffin.
I sent them $20.

& street fair on Christopher Street took place under hot (80s) sunny
skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters
out there willing to post a detailed article?

International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.
""More and More Love"", Japan, 1984, is directly concerned with
homophobia and the AIDS crisis. It tells of a popular singer
who finds love, a journalist who exposes him, the hysterical
reactions of his Christian parents, his fear that he has caught
AIDS and his supportive gay friends. The film is a strong indictment
of the negative effect Christianity has had on Japanese society.
There were a number of long sex scenes (as close to hard-core
as you can get without showing genitals), and this might seem
inappropriate in a serious film to Western audiences.
At the end, there was mixed applause and boos from the audience.
I don't think the boos were deserved, but I agree the film had
some problems, including a rather exaggerated (and perhaps
unfamiliar) style. Directed by Koshi Shimada, and produced by
Japan's (supposedly) most visible gay activist Ken Togoh.
""Naughty Boys"", Netherlands, 1983. After the party, six men
in evening dress, having strange telephone conversations
with remote lovers (in different languages), and remembering
earlier dances. A very experimental and slow-moving film.
We left about half-way through.
""The L-Shaped Room"", UK, 1962. This was in the ""1960's Britsh
Cinema"" series, when British films were beginning to treat
homosexual characters in a non-stereotypical manner.
(Watching the trailers for some of these was pretty amusing.)
Jane (Leslie Caron), pregnant and single, moves into a
seady rooming house. She falls in love with Toby (Tom Bell),
but their love is complicated by the baby and by Toby's poverty.
Among the other boarders are Johnny (Brock Peters - black so of
course he plays the trumpet), who is in love with Toby, and
various other off-beat characters.
Best scene (paraphrased from memory):
@begin(MINOR SPOILER)
Another roomer (Cicily Courtneidge) is an aging ex-vaudevillian.
She reminisces about her one true love.
Jane asks a question about ""him"".
""Him? Who do you mean?""
""Why, your old flame.""
""If you want to, there's a picture of my sweetheart.""
As Jane looks at the picture (another actress), and does double-take:
""It takes all kinds, dear.""
<<Applause>>
Then: ""I hope [the baby] is a girl, dear. Boys are so much trouble.""
<<Applause>>
@end(MINOR SPOILER)
Maltin gives this 3.5 stars, Scheurer (?) 4 stars. I think 3 stars.
It's long, and (while perhaps brave for the time) a little dated.
It's an interesting look at the period, though, and the characters
are also interesting and well acted.
""Horror Vacui-Die Angst vor der Leere"" (Horror Vacui-The Fear of
Emptyness), West Germany, 1984. This tells how a young gay student
falls into the clutches of Madame C and her cult of Optimal
Optimism, and how his more level-headed lover tries to rescue him.
This is filmed in a very minimalist and expressionistic style.
It concerns how people are willing to bow down to an authority
figure who tells them what to do, even at the cost of their own
destruction, and has a post-Nazi sensitivity.
This is a serious, funny and brilliant movie (""worth 5 bucks and
standing in the rain""), directed by Rosa von Praunheim.
""Luminous Procuress"", US, 1971. This film by Steven Arnold was
supposedly a major avant-garde success, and got raves even by
mainstream critics. It tells how two young men are shown around
in a very strange brothel. It's a mostly-straight film. It
features the Cockettes, a comedy/drag/musical troupe from then.
Most of the film displays elaborate but rather static set-pieces,
where nude or outrageously dressed people are part of the scenery.
As a futher alienating device, it's all non-verbal: When people
are speaking, you hear a voice-over of someone speaking what
could be Russian or a nonsense language.
There was applause at the end, but I found it mostly boring.
Shorts:
""David Roche Talks to you about Love"".
Basically a very funny, very cynical and very painful long
monolog by Roche. Definitely worth going out of your way for,
even if you're straight. Quotes:
""Love is knowledge and acceptance (in spite of the knowledge)"".
""A loves B, who loves C, who loves D, who has a vibrator.""
""The Steps"", an amusing little hommage to Sergei Eisenstein.
""Castro Street"", filmed at Halloween. I found it pretty boring,
though many in the audience seemed to like it. Being done in
8mm (at least it looked like it) didn't help. I guess I'm pretty
jaded, having been to too many masquerades at too many science
fiction conventions to be easily impressed.
Earlier I've seen two earlier festival films: ""The Times of
Harvey Milk"" (of which enough has already been said in this
newsgroup), and ""Before Stonewall - The Making of a Lesbian
and Gay Community"" (US, 1984). This is a reasonably good
historical overview upto the Stonewall riots. I heard there
are a couple of historical inaccuracies (there \was/ an
American homophile political group before the Mattachine
Society), and sanitizations.
A number of other movies looked interesting, but it's
a long drive to Mecca...

I have contributed to the Colorado AIDS Project (CAP) which is a local,
non-profit organization which assists persons with AIDS and provides
information and education about AIDS to the public.    It funds no
medical research.
Although I realize that medical research is an endeavor which requires
""mega-bucks"" that many say only government can provide,  I would point out
that the same could be said of cancer research which does, I believe, get
significant funding from private donations.   It is probably the best way
to augment the shrinking government support for AIDS research in these days
of Federal cutbacks in everything that isn't military.
I would appreciate any information anyone might have.

>Robert DeBenedictis
I believe the word ""homophobia"" was coined by Dr. George Weinberg in his
book ""Society and the Healthy Homosexual"" (1973), in which he argues
that the fear homosexuality exhibited by many individuals in our
culture has all the earmarks of a psychological phobia, and therefor
it is those who hate/fear/etc. homosexuals/homosexuality who have
a psychological illness, not the persons who are homosexual.
He argues that it is prevalent among males to fear other males,
in other than purely sexual ways.
He uses ""homophobia"" to refer to this phobia (i.e. irrational fear)
towards people of the same sex, and therefore towards homosexuality
and homosexuals.
By backformation, we have created the word ""homophobe"" to refer to
someone who suffers from homophobia. I have always thought of 
""homophobe"" as parallel in formation to ""homosexual"".
The ""homo-"" is the Greek prefix for ""same"",
hence ""homosexual"" refers to ""sex"" with someone of the ""same [gender]"",
and ""homophobe"" refers to ""phobia"" towards someone of the ""same [gender]"".
It never occurred to me that one might think of the ""homo"" part as not
being a prefix, but of being slang shortening of ""homosexual"", as if
to say ""queerphobe"".

 BOSTON (AP) - A virus almost identical to the germ generally thought
  to cause AIDS had been found in monkeys, and some scientists believe
  it will provide an important new tool for developing a vaccine to
  control the epidemic of the fatal disease.
    The latest discover also supports a theory that AIDS - Acquired
  Immune Deficiency Syndrome - began as a disease of monkeys and only
  recently spread to people.
    Scientists at the New England Regional Primate Centre identified
  the virus in macaque monkeys.  The animals were afflicted with
  monkey AIDS, a disease that mirrors AIDS in people.
    American experts believe that human AIDS is caused by a virus called
  HTLV-III, for Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus type three, and they've
  named the new monkey virus STLV-III, for simians.
    ""Clearly we have, for the first time, a virus that looks and acts
  like HTLV-III, than clearly can infect and be isolated from animals
  other than humans,"" said Dr. Norman Letvin of the primate centre.
    Scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health have discovered
  that the monkey AIDS virus appears to be common among a species called
  the African green monkey that lives in central Africa.
    ""We hypothesize that the African greens gave the virus to people
  in the region where the disease originated,"" probably within the last
  10 to 50 years, said Dr. Max Essex, an AIDS researcher at Harvard.
    Although STLV-III is fatal to macaque monkeys, it apparently is not
  dangerous to the African green monkeys, which are a separate species.
  About 70 per cent of the green monkeys tested showed evidence in their
  blood of exposure to the virus, yet they were healthy.
    ""They have clearly evolved to control the virus so it doesn't kill
  them,"" said Essex.  ""The mechanism that they've evolved will probably
  be an important clue to understanding vaccine development.""...

_A_Disturbed_Peace_
_Another Egypt_
by Brian McNaught
	These can be dark and dreary times for many gay men and
lesbians.
	For some of the people in our developing community, the events
of these days even prompt moments of despair; of angry denunciations of
being gay; of periodic longings for the security of the life they
""remember"" having before coming out of the closet.
	The reasons for these feelings of anxiety are numerous and
certainly understandable.  Some of us, for instance, live in cities in
which 60% of the beds in our hospitals' intensive care units are occupied
by persons with AIDS.  We've lost good friends.  We live in fear of
losing others and of contacting AIDS ourselves.  We're confused and
alarmed.
	Some of us live in states where moronic legislators speak
carelessly of quarantining us in the public interest.  Our local
authorities seek to close our bathhouses and, though we are not patrons
of the baths, we wonder where they will stop.  We're frightened and angry.
	Some of us make our homes in places where our neighbors and our
associates voted overwhelmingly to rescind our rights to employment.
Some of us go to schools where straight students have sold hundreds of
""Fagbuster"" sweatshirts.  Some of us live in towns where anti-gay
violence is dramatically on the rise.  We're shocked and we're depressed.
	""Why did we ever leave the closet?"" some of us ask.  ""What did
we accomplish by coming out?  At least we were safe when we pretended
to be straight,"" some of us argue.  ""Even if it wasn't a perfect life,
it was better to be safe passing for straight than to die out of the
closet.""
	If we gay people listen carefully, we can hear other voices
echo our anxiety.
	When the Jews left Egypt, many of them did so with mixed
emotions.  They were excited by the sense of independence and
self-determination which Moses promised them, but they were also
frightened of the unknown.  When they realized that Pharaoh and his army
were rapidly pursuing them, some of them yelled at Moses, ""Why did you
do this to us?  Why did you bring us out of Egypt?  Did we not tell you
this in Egypt when we said, 'Leave us alone.  Leave us serve the
Egyptians'?  Far better for us to be the slaves of the Egyptians than to
die in the desert.""
	Moses was probably hurt and confused by the frightened and angry
responses of his people.  Had he made a mistake in leaving Egypt?  Was
it better to be a slave?  Why had he left in the first place?
	It was the voice which led Moses out of Egypt, and it was the
voice in which he ultimately placed his trust.  The voice that which led
Moses and the Jews out of slavery is the exact same voice which
whispered a dream to Martin Luther King, Jr.  The voice which led an
entire nation of Jews into a 40-year wandering in the desert is the same
voice which led Ghandi to burn his English-made clothes, which led
Caesar Chavez to politically organize his family and friends in the
vineyards of California, which led Margaret Sanger to defy the law by
providing birth control information to women.
	The voice which speaks is the voice of God, which is the voice
of life, which is the voice of self-affirmation.  Moses heard the voice
say, ""I am what I am.""  Albin clears the stage in _La_Cage_Aux_Folles to
proclaim ""I am what I am.""  The voice within is a constant but generally
subtle longing to live life fully and equally; to live life
authentically and to die knowing that you have bloomed to your full
potential.
	The voice within is the persons best friend.  It is also a
troubleraker.  The voice within sings an anthem of independence.
Listening to it can prompt you to do and say things you never imagined
were within you.  Following its call to action can create all sorts of
trouble.  Family and friends will say ""You've changed.""  Employeers will
get nervous that you are getting out of line.  Priests and rabbis will
begin warning you of the sins of pride and reminding you of the perils
of heresy.
	People who listen to the voice almost always lose the security
with which society had rewarded them for staying in line; for staying in
Egypt; for staying on the plantation; for staying in the closet.  When
you listen to the voice within and decide to leave Egypt in the hope of
finding a homeland, Pharaohs chase you with their armies, voters take
away your rights, college jocks mock you and people call you names like
""militant,"" ""radical,"" ""avowed"" and ""troublemaker.""
	There is no story in the history of humankind in which people
have listened to the voice within without suffering.  All growth
requires pain.  Any time people have demanded that the world make room
for their being, society has responded with the likes of Jerry Falwell,
Jessie Helms, Cal Thomas and the other Pharaohs with whom we currently
deal.
	Likewise, every time there is a troublemaking move out of
captivity into liberation, there have always been and will always be
nagging doubts, fears and anxieties among the liberated and among those
called to liberation.  Surely there were Jews who stayed in Egypt just
as there are women who curse feminism and as there are closeted
homosexuals who hate the Movement because it threatens their security.
For every gay man or lesbian who has left the closet but at times wishes
they hadn't, there are black people in history who periodically wished
they hadn't left the security of the plantation and Indians who wished
the English had not granted their country its independence.
Self-determination is an awesome challenge and it is natural to feel
doubts and fears.
	Our generation has been tapped to lead the modern liberation
movement while at the same time cope with the horrors of AIDS.  Previous
generations have been tapped to cope with the horrors of the Crusades,
the Inquisition, the Witch Trials, the Holocaust and the McCarthy Era.
All of them died in the desert rather than serve the Egyptians.  All of
us will probably die before the others reach the Promised Land, but the
movement forward will continue, even if, at times, it is an undirected
wandering.
	Though these are dark and dreary times for many gay men and
lesbians who periodically think of the ""comforts"" of the closet, the
Pharaoh and his armies are still not enough to keep the people in
captivity.  ""I came out at the beginning of this year,"" wrote a
55-year-old stranger to me in a letter to me yesterday, ""by telling my
wife of 23 years and my two sons (21 and 22) that I am gay.  I moved
into an apartment.  I have a very special friend with whom I hope a
lasting relationship will develop.  After so many years of living
straight and being gay, I have now found a peace which I neither knew
was possible nor had any hope of achieving.""
	Welcome to the desert, friend.
________________________________________________________________________
I, and perhaps many of those gays who profess to be Christian,
have this feeling that the Christian/Jewish God is our God, even though
we seem to see a whole different aspect of Him than the right-wing edge
of Christianity.  It is often my feeling that that group of Christians
who deny others the right to be Christian in their own ways don't really
understand what/who this God they worship is, and therefore end up
standing in His way.  And that is the reason many gays (like me) spend
long hours trying to convince Christians that they should not fear us,
but should be standing in the trenches beside us working for world where
everyone has the right to be themselves and free.

That is not quite true.  He did not allow the ""ones who disobeyed"" to
enter the ""promised land"", He did not kill them out of hand as some of
the more right wing Christians propose to do to gays.  The commandments
he gave then have no mention of homosexuality (read the 10 commandments
again).

However the ongoing theme of the Gosples is that the Law is Love and Love
is Holy.  You have distorted this position.

As I have stated previously, several times, *I* am *not* a Christian.
My understanding of God, although heavily influenced by the Christian
Bible, has very little in common with traditional Christianity.  I
may write an article at some point in the future detailing my religious
beliefs, but let it suffice for the moment that my perception of the
value of Jesus Christ is His teaching that loving ones neighbors in a
positive manner (that is to say, in an active manner) is the only earthly
method of showing ones real ""love of God"".  Therefore, I find it
unbelievable that He would ask me to give up loving Steven, since this
would be a distinct contradiction of his message.
>I must ask myself this question and if there is, well, let's build
>a statue and shrine because we will have discovered our god.
>I do not fear you, but I can not call you brother, for you are not of
>the same Spirit.
Then you do not understand the ""Spirit"" as I do either.  By stating that
I am not your ""brother"" and that I am not of the ""same Spirit"" you are
being rather judgemental.  As I recollect, Jesus taught that all men are
""brothers"" (all people are children of God), not just Jews (there were
no Christians at that time).  This seems to indicate that although you
call yourself a Christian, you think that Jesus was a liar.  Is that the
case?
>If we say that we have no sin, we lie and do not the truth ( I John)
I have not made any statement of the sort that I do not not sin.  However,
my sins are between me and my God, and have nothing to do with you.  Make
sure you do not have a log in your eye before you start trying to pick the
mote out of mine.

I apologize for misunderstanding your position.
The Law is NOT love, God is love.  The Law condemns us.
Jesus did NOT teach that all men are brothers.  In a sense we
are, but only those who are followers of Jesus are Sons of God
and are His brothers.  That is the kind of brother I was referring to,
but since you are not a christian it is irrelevent.
Living to your full potential would be living your life the way
God would want wouldn't it?  Good grammer huh?
Becoming a Christian is giving up our way to follow His, because
we realize that His way is the best way.

publication in Esperanto put out by the Ligo de Samseksamaj Geesperantistoj.
Well, a copy of ""Forumo"" recently passed through my hands, so I thought I'd
mention a bit more about it.
The focus of ""Forumo"", as you might expect, seems to be an international
perspective on gay rights and culture.  The issue I saw included brief news
articles on gay issues translated from various national presses (an article
on gay rights and the U.S. Supreme Court from ""Time,"" for instance),
references to gay matters in the mainstream Esperanto press, an AIDS update,
a bit of news from the British gay bar scene, and a couple of poems.  A
great deal of attention was paid to the gay scene in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, including an article on gay terminology in various Eastern
European languages, an informal report on gay activity at a resort in
Yugoslavia, and the first in a series of excerpts dealing with gays in
Poland from the Austrian book, ""Rosa Liebe unterm Roten Stern"" (""Pink Love
Under the Red Star"").  As in any Esperanto publication, there were a number
of ""volas korespondi"" ads for pen pals; the majority of these came from
Eastern block countries.
One of the main functions of ""Forumo"", therefore, appears to be to provide a
bridge between relatively isolated gays in Soviet-bloc Europe and the
relatively open gay scene in the West.  Partly so it can achieve this,
""Forumo"" is printed in a small format and is just a few pages long, allowing
it to be sent by letter class rather than as a periodical.  It also seemed
to be rather circumspect in appearance, not printing anything that could be
called pornography or that would be certain to upset a non-Esperanto-
speaking postal censor.
If any of you are interested in the experiences of gays in Eastern Europe,
""Forumo"" seems to be a way to find out more.  Subscriptions cost three
British pounds per calendar year (four or five issues) and can be ordered
from the secretary of the LSG:
			Mr. Peter A. Danning
			G/f, 68, Church Road
			Richmond (Sy) TW10 6LN
			Great Britain
I have also seen a copy of a similar publication put out by Geja
Emancipi^go, another gay Esperanto organization.  It was somewhat less
serious in content, about half of it consisting of sexually explicit
photographs.  Peter Danning can probably provide more information if
anyone is interested.

I agree completely with \bob.  What this guy is really saying, or thinking, 
is that in reality you are looking for sex, not a roommate.  If they allow 
people to indicate that they only want to live with a male, or a female, a 
non-smoker, etc...why is being gay where they **have** to draw the line? 
It's a phoney excuse not to deal with the real issues.
KEN ARNDT asks:

Why should Robert have to ask people if they object to his life (we live 
lives, NOT lifestyles!!!!)? 
When talking to someone on the phone, it is easy enought to say, ""I am gay,
but don't have any problems living with someone who isn't.""  And leave it
at that. If they have trouble living with someone who is gay, that's their
problem, not ours. 
>>   How about, ""I don't like women.""; ""I don't like men who like women."";

		      >>Lori Fuller  
I really agree with Lori on this one.  I had a straight roommate when I was 
coming out (when she moved in I *thought* I was straight also.)  Throughout 
the entire coming out process it was very hard having a straight woman 
around who was talking about going out with men, bringing men home, and 
having to deal with her boyfriend who was around quite a bit.  I think that 
if you choose to live with someone (not a friend) who is straight, there is 
a lot you have to contend with.  I'm not sure it's worth it.

This guy gets me angrier than Ken Arndt does!  I am trying to maintain my
cool, but I definately feel a flame coming on: 
Essentially what you are saying is that you have the ""best"" of both worlds; 
you enjoy HETEROSEXUAL PRIVILEDGE, but you also engage in gay sex.  From 
your het world you can say ""why do you people do such and such...."" and you 
disassociate from the gay men who you might sleep with.  It's so safe for 
you, and such a superior attitude. 
Gays have a right to be proud of themselves, to love themselves and be who 
they are.  We do not flaunt our sexuality any more than heterosexuals do.  
In fact, we do it a lot less.  Witness Robert's dilemma and the trouble he 
has put himself through all because he wanted to use a company newsletter 
that is available to anyone who works in the company.  A straight man or 
woman would have just run their ad, and never worried about a thing.
Heterosexually is everywhere...it is flaunted in every media constantly; 
gays are assulted with it to the point that we feel totally alien and 
alienated from the society.  Why shouldn't we be legal???  
You may be bisexual, but you are HOMOPHOBIC (I'm not even going to address 
your racism, that would start a lot more than a flame...probably a barn 
fire).
Flame off...simmer....

5 February 1985.
	According to Friday's (2/1) USA Today, Bruce Voeller,
a biologist and president of the Mariposa Foundation, announced
results of a four-year study which showed that nonoxynol-9 may
prove useful in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus.
This study was done in collaboration with the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.  Voeller advocates that people use
over-the-counter spermicides that contain at least 5% nonoxynol-9
as sexual lubricants to lower their risk of contracting AIDS.

     The nonoxynol-9 story is a prime example of the media's indiscriminate

                How to Survive the Breakup of a Bad Relationship
                                 Jason
            This article doesn't come from discussions at gay rap groups
         but from my own experience and that of friends who I've helped
         deal with their breakups. I'm very happy for those who have a
         warm, loving relationship that is stable. I have found out that
         in the gay world this is a rare commodity indeed.
            I met Danny five years ago at a friend's Labor Day cookout. At
         the time I was unattached and Danny showed interest, so we talk-
         ed all through the day and exchanged the obligatory phone num-
         bers; promising to get together. I had a strange gut feel about
         the guy but couldn't put a finger on what it was. He was quite
         handsome, intelligent (or so it seemed) and charming; almost too
         charming as I remember.
            The following Friday my roomate and I had just sat down to eat
         when the phone rang. It was Danny asking if he could come over
         for a while. I asked Lauren if it was ok with him and he nodded.
         Lauren was just getting over the breakup of a very bad 2 year
         relationship with an alcoholic. He was at the party where I met
         Danny and also had funny feelings about him but wrote it off as
         just his own paranoia about getting involved.
            In four months I was very much in love and agreed to move in 
         with  Danny. Once I moved in; I started learning a lot of things
         that would have swayed my decision toward calling it quits with
         Dan. He knew what he was doing all right. He was on his best be-
         havior until he knew I was his. I first learned he had herpes
         from his brother whom I had become good friends with. His broth-
         er also told me about the pathological lieing, alcoholism, and
         psychotic episodes the family was target of. When I tried talk-
         ing to Dan about his brother and my conversations; he blew up!
         Dan told me that his brother was schizoid and had been put away
         for two years. He managed to convince me this was the truth so
         I avoided his brother for a while. I learned in time that every
         word his brother Jim told me was 100% fact.
            I would come home from work to find him quite drunk and in a
         nasty mood. Sometimes he would go out and not return for a coup-
         le of days, telling me it was none of my business where he had 
         been. He also made a point of buttering up most of my friends and
         attempted to do the same with my family; who saw through him
         from day one. Mom couldn't convince me that he was no good since
         my emotions had blinded my thinking. I was determined to make this
         relationship work and at times even Danny seemed to want to
         make an effort. His efforts were sporadic; one week he was kind
         and loving, the next impossible to live with.
            This went on for three years until I started losing my zest for
         just about everything. I started drinking more than I should and
         became moody. My performance at the office took a nosedive and
         I was warned to, ""Straighten up, or else!"" In my entire working
         career I had always been rated as an excellent worker. I knew
         that I was unhappy in the relationship but was afraid to break it
         off since Dan had threatened to cause mayhem if I did. He was
         always telling me how insecure I was; it was really him who was
         the more insecure. I made a conscious effort to remove myself from
         Dan while living with him. This gave me the emotional distance I 
         needed to make the important decision to drop out.
            Danny knew something was up with me. The day I decided to have
         the summit talks with him, he came home carrying flowers for me
         and champagne. I told him how I felt about all the shenannigans
         he'd pulled and that things would have to change. He flew into a
         rage, smashing the champagne bottle on the coffee table then
         stormed out of the apartment.
            Two days later I got a call from him. He was crying and begged
         to come back. Just for the record; this happened about once a 
         month, this time being the last. When he knew I was serious he
         threatened suicide. He came and picked up his things the follow-
         ing Saturday. Nothing was said between us and I thought I'de seen
         the last of him. Over the next few weeks I got quite a few
         phone calls from friends of mine telling me he had visited them
         telling about what a rotten person I was, about my psychotic ep-
         isodes and my alcoholism. He also called the office and told my 
         boss that I was gay and he was my lover. We had taken some Pol-
         oroids of us in bed when we first met. I never thought to look
         for them. I got a call from my mother who was very upset. You
         guessed it; he had sent the pictures to my mother. The guy was
         trying his best to ruin me before he left. The phone rang at all
         hours of the night with just silence on the other end. I called
         the police who just laughed about the two fags having a lover's
         quarrel. This went on for two months, until a friend of his drop-
         ped by to visit. He told me Dan left for San Francisco the day
         before and that he had many questions about Dan himself. We sat
         up until four a.m. and I learned a lot more about the character.
            I had met an ex-lover of Dan's once. I knew he lived in Boston
         and gave him a call. He was only too happy to have me over to
         talk. The story of his year with Danny was a carbon copy of what
         I was going through. After Dan finished trying to ruin Ralph, he
         hopped a plane for Chicago; two years before meeting me. Danny
         told me that he had always lived in Massachusetts when we met. I
         learned that he had lived all over the country, raising havoc with
         every life he touched, then moving on.
            That's one of my stories. It seems very similar to ones that
         friends have told me about past lovers. I swear there must be a
         factory somewhere in Detroit that manufactures these people.
         Now ole Jason will share some hints on how to recover from such
         an affair.
         * The two of you have had the same serious fight for the 175 th
           time, you've broken up 3 or 4 times and things always seemed
           to be better for a few weeks after you got back together but
           you don't feel like you can handle another round. Fine! it may
           be time to part company. If the guy is sane, then the two of
           you can shake hands, hug and fade into each other's history.
           You might even go on to become bosem buddies. If he's at all
           like Danny, read on.
         * If you fear that your lover may be violent when you break the 
           news that it's over, have a friend nearby who is willing to 
           take you in for a while. You may want to tell him in a semi-  
           public place where there are other people present; preferably
           not a bar.
         * Warn your friends that he may be dropping by to tell his tale
           of woe. If they're really your friends you won't be hearing
           what a hot lay he was from them. They probably will show him 
           the way to the door.
 
         * You may also be hearing from his friends after the breakup. Be
           very careful on the phone when talking to them; he may be lis-
           tening on an extension and trying to get the goods on you. Be
           polite but brief unless you really know his friends better than
           you knew him.
         * He may try to contact your family; giving all the sordid det-
           ails of the relationship. If you're not out to Mom, this may
           be a good time to come out gracefully to her,""Uh! Mom, you know my
           roomate Larry, weeeelllll there's something I've been wanting
           to share with you about him and I"". She's probably figured
           it out after visiting your one bedroom apartment anyway.
         * Once the bum's out get his keys back, then have the locks 
           changed. This is very important if your now, ex is anything
           like my Danny. It can ruin your whole day to come home from
           work to find only a lone coffee table in the living room, the
           one he smashed the champagne bottle on. Also have the phone
           number changed; preferably to an unlisted one. This will help
           keep harassment to a minimum via the phone. 
         * If you're afraid he'll call the office, it helps to be out to
           your boss. I was working for a woman at the time when I warned
           her about Danny calling. She told me that she had dated a guy
           much like Dan and that she'd take care of the twerp. What she
           did was cruel but I loved it. He called her as I feared he 
           would. My boss just said,""Oh really, uh huh, uh huh, well I'm
           sleeping with him now!"" She told me Dan hung up post haste. If
           you're not out to the boss you can always warn he or she that an
           escaped lunatic may call claiming to be God. It just helps to
           warn the boss that some slightly deluded individual may call
           and to ignore them.
         * Make sure all your valuables are in a safe place like at Mom's
           house when the shit hits the fan. Take inventory of all valu-
           able receipts, titles, bank and check books, etc and put them
           somewhere out of reach. Go see Mom again.
         * If he's left anything behind, don't throw it away for a while,
           at least until you're sure he's gone for good. He may be back
           looking for his stuff later and raise a real stink if you've
           canned everything.
         * If you own anything jointly, get an agreement in writing of who
           gets the property. You can only do this if the ex is rational
           and isn't carrying a gun. The same goes for money in joint
           savings/checking accounts. Better still, if the two of you hav-
           en't been together for an appreciable length of time, then
           separate accounts are a wiser decision. Users will usually press-
           ure you from the beginning to pool your resources; beware!
         * If he starts pleading to come back and you've been through the
           same melodrama with him before, be firm in letting him know
           it's over but don't threaten, ""If I see your fucking face ar-
           ound here I'll kill you"". This will only get the turkey upset
           and start him gobbling all the more. Try to let him think that
           there may be a chance in the future (like the year 2013) that
           the two of you may be able to make a go of it again. These guys
           don't handle rejection very well, much worse than the rest of
           us.
 
         * Another ploy he may use is the,""Let's just sleep together one
           time"" routine. It's wise to just say NO! With your jumbled up
           emotions, you'll probably take him back again for the 147 th 
           time and wind up where you started. Remember that this guy can
           probably read you like a book and play you like a piano. Being
           firm will let him know in a very short time that you mean bus-
           iness. You have seen through him and he's aware that others
           have also. He's terrified of going it alone again because he
           may not be so lucky landing another sucker in the future. He'll
           be forced to face himself and users don't want to do that; do
           they. Resist the Siren's song at all costs.
         * Well! you're all alone now in this big apartment, right! Take
           my advice and don't go rushing out to fill the void with an-
           other warm body. Nature abhors a vacuum and so do newly part-
           ed lovers. You're very vulnerable now and risk attracting an
           even worse turkey. These users/losers can smell an easy mark
           ten miles away and will try sweet talking their way into your
           life. It's now time for you to take stock of yourself. Chances
           are that when the two of you were together, you didn't have much
           time for yourself. Indulge in a hobby, call a long neglected
           friend over for dinner, take a night course, etc. The import-
           ant thing right now is to fill your time with things you enjoy
           doing. 
         * You may go through a period of promiscuity where you'll screw
           anything that stands still long enough. This is fine as long 
           as it  doesn't become a habit or depressing. Make sure you're
           not looking for the deep loving sex you had with what's his
           name while sowing your wild oats. Whoring around has become
           somewhat of a hazard with the advent of AIDS. If you don't
           feel good about being a slut for a while, then don't!
         * You may try getting involved with a gay social group if there's
           one convenient to you. This will offer you a non bar social
           outlet, unless the ex shows up; then go back home and watch
           Dynasty. Chances are that the ex will move off to places un-
           known; especially if he's like Danny.
         * Allow yourself to mourn the loss of a relationship. You've
           probably put a lot of effort into it and it's ok to feel bad
           even though the guy was a loser. After a while you may feel
           anger, even rage when you realize the ride you were taken on.
           It's ok to be mad. Call up a friend and let him know how you
           feel. If the bad feelings become obsessive, call a shrink if
           necessary. He'll let you be angry and might give you one of
           those foam rubber bats to smack the chair with in effigy to
           your ex.
         * I find that working with people who are hurting worse than me
           helps get my mind off my own loss. It might help to volunteer
           time manning a hot-line, visiting the elderly or doing volun-
           teer work with handicapped people.
         * Now is also a good time to stay away from alcohol and drugs.
           They may make the hurt go away right now, but only prolong it
           in the long run.
 
         * If you've had a continuous track record of Dannys, then it's
           now time to do some serious soul searching into the reasons
           that you attract these losers in the first place. Are you an
           emotional masochist, are you too nice and trusting a person?
           These guys will walk a mile to attach themselves to people like
           you. This may be the time to be a little more cynical, as bad
           as it may sound. Friends may be able to add some insight into
           why a nice guy like you attracts these jerks.
         * If Mr. loser disappears into a black hole somewhere, don't be 
           afraid to look up an old ex of his or chat with his friends.
           This isn't prying so much as it is therapy. They may share in-
           formation with you that will help you get over the ex in a much
           shorter time. It's ok to reality test.
         * Lastly, I hope you learn from your mistakes as I have. I'm much
           better off because of Danny. The relationship with him taught me
           many valuable lessons about what I do/don't want out of life.
         * When you do meet who you may think is Mr. Wonderful, don't rush
           into the vine covered cottage after 2 weeks. Take time to get to 
           him as a friend, date, court; it can be lots of fun and when the
           two of you decide to bed down together, much more satisfying.
           Even if the two of you never sleep together, you may have gained
           a valuable new friend. Remember you may not have a lover but you
           can never have too many good friends

there are two.  the first is to love the lord your god with your whole

Um, just to give my own two-cents, Larry, welcome to the net and
{mod,net}.motss, but as you might expect, this discussion is not
particularly new or novel to readers of net.motss, is not a central
purpose of net.motss, and has been successfully exorcised several
times before.  Right now it seems to be precariously contained to
net.religion.christian, where both sides of the discussion can
generate as much heat as they like.  Were I involved in such a
crossfire, I'd probably post a small note like your paragraph

What ever happened to it?  It's still active.  True, there are folk who will
decide that they should be the instruments of God's wrath.  On the other hand,
there are those who believe that they have to speak the truth as they see it,
just as you believe that you must be true to yourself.
Please, save your anger for the former group.  The latter are just as sincere
as you are, whether you can understand it or not.  They believe that they have
a duty, both to God and to YOU to speak as they do.

That circular track, for some lucky  people, is the belief that they should
have nothing on their minds bigger than God.  As to  ``how holy thou art'' ...
where do you draw the line between believing that you are doing the right thing
and being self-righteous?  It isn't always obvious.

And there are PLENTY of Christians who will do the same thing.  That's
compassion and common sense and it does not contradict our instructions from
God.  Remember, Jesus ate with those ``known'' to be sinners.

For the thoughtful Christian, this is the crux of a moral dilemma:  Does
this orientation, not of an individual's choosing, give someone the burden
of obeying very severe laws that others are not burdened by?  Or does it give
them the right to contravene statements that appear (to many, anyway) to be
clear prohibitions?

be confusion.  Sorry, I'm less than perfect.

Hmm.  I don't know anyone who does that.  As I said, there are dilemmas
involved, but there's a difference between ``We don't want society to say
what you're doing is right.'' and ``We want to burn you at the stake because
we want to see you burn in Hell.''
>i'm scared to death that one day my sexual preference will be OUTLAWED!!!
For what it's worth, it was (and probably still is).  Most people nowadays
are content to let things go on behind closed doors.  This wasn't always
true ... look at Oscar Wilde and Alan Turing.

I doubt that you are speaking to your audience here.  It's unlikely that too
many people on this net are doing many of the things that you have described.
And the people engaging in assuaults such as those you describe are NOT
behaving in a very Christian manner, so perhaps flaming at Christians is not
speaking to your audience either.

What?  You don't eat, put your pants (or nylons) on one leg at a time,

Unfortunately, most Christians ignore the rest of that book of the Bible,
eating pork and shellfish, milk at the same meal as meat (and on the same

But I know lots of young people who have been thrown out of their
Christian parents home because they were gay, often after being
subjected to avertion therapy, electo-shock therapy, or prayer
marathons.  Sorry, but they call themselves Christians and go to
Church 4 times a week and read their Bibles.  Jerry Falwell, that
'great Chrittian fellow' in the news for the last few years, tells
lies on his pulpit.  I can only go by what they tell me, since enough
of them act the same way, I assume its a Christian trait.  Even you
seem to want to 'keep me in my place' ('we don't want society to
endorse what you do').
Fuck off Christian!

Today in New York, the Scientists Institute for Public Information met
to gather all valid information on AIDS to give the press and insure
the accuracy of news coverage & public knowledge.  It was hoped that
such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused, unable to find time in his schedule to attend.  The
fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused the creation of
three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen: HTLV-III by
Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much reserch & testing.","2sl3JcHlEH8J",18,1985-02-09,-12,29

Newport Beach, Calif. -
Scientists have for the first time identified an antibody that inactivates
the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome virus in laboratory experiments, a
step toward development of an AIDS vaccine,  a researcher said yesterday.
Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute,  who headed one of the
two teams that announced discovery of the likely AIDS virus last April,
said the antibody knocks out the ability of the AIDS virus to infect cells.
But Gallo warned that the discovery ""does not prove you're going to be 
successful in finding a vaccine.""
Asked if he believes an anti-AIDS vaccine can be developed, Gallo replied:
""I am hopeful....but it's really hard to say when.""
Considerable research must be done to determine whether the anti-AIDS anti-
body will destroy the virus in the human body as effectively as it destroys
it in the laboratory.
Gallo described the discovery while talking to reporters attending a 
scientific conference in Newport Beach sponsored by the City of Hope 
Medical Center.  He said the discovery, made only recently,  has not 
been reported in a scientific journal.
The so-called ""neutralizing antibody"" was identified by Dr. Marjorie 
Robert-Guroff in Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute 
and independently by Dr. Martin Hirsch at Massachusetts General Hos-
pital, Gallo said.
Reached in Boston, Hirsch confirmed the discovery of the antibody against
AIDS, but declined further comment, except to say his findings will soon 
be published in a letter to the editor of a medical journal -- which he
declined to identify -- and will be presented in April during an AIDS 
conference in Atlanta.
The virus attacks a certain class of white blood cells called T-cells,
which help the body ward off disease.  The virus is called HTLV-III,
and was discovered by Gallo and his colleagues last year.
It is the third of a class of human viruses called human T-cell lympho-
tropic viruses.
A closely related virus, called LAV, or lymphadenopathy associated virus,
was discovered about the same time by researchers at the Pasteur Institute
in Paris.
A major question has been whether the viruses are identical.  If they are
very different, it could complicate the search for a vaccine.
But Gallo said yesterday that HTLV-III and LAV essentially are the same
despite a 5 percent to 10 percent variation in the genetic code which
governs activities of the 104 different types of AIDS virus Gallo said
have so far been isolated.
It is not yet known whether those genetic differences mean the viruses
act differently biologically, he said.  If they did, it might mean that
a vaccine effective against one variety of AIDS virus might not work
against another.
But, Gallo added: ""Right now we can't say there's any important biologi-
cal difference.""

From METROLINE, a hartford conn paper, Dec 28, 1984:  (Quoted w/o permission)
			TWO MORE HETEROSEXUAL *AIDS* CASES REPORTED
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Researchers reported two new heterosexual cases of 
	Aquired [sic] Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and warned the mysterious and
	often fatal disease could become an endemic to people of all sexual
	persuasions [sic, I say ``orientations''].
	 Drs. Paul Volberding and Constance Wofsy called a press conference to 
	report their findings and to urge ""safe sex"" practices for all San 
	Francisco Bay area residents.
	 Volberding recommended that hetersexuals confine sexual activity to 
	one partner, avoid promiscuity and use condoms consistently and 
	carefully with new partners.
	 ""It would be irresponsible not to give early notice to the 
	heterosexual community that sexual contact with persons carrying the 
	AIDS virus appears to put them at a risk for contracting the disease,"" 
	Volberding said.
	 The two latest heterosexual AIDS victims [sic, never say ``victim'' to 
	one who has AIDS] brings the total to four of cases outside the 
	so-called high risk category of homosexual men in San Francisco in less
	than one month. 
	 One case involved a woman who apparently contracted the disease three 
	and half years ago after an affair with a bisexual man.  Three 
	heterosexual men with AIDS have a history of sexual contacts with 
	prostitutes, Volberding said.
	 Volberding, director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic, 
	said the new cases ""further confirm our concern that AIDS is a disease 
	that hetersexuals can develop.  The major factor appears to be direct 
	sexual contact with persons who have the AIDS virus.
I offer this article only as a note.  The article isn't the best on the block, 
but it _was_ targeted for the motss-lovin' audience who are presumed to know 
something about the AIDS situation.
Those who appreciate both genders are not always popular, and unfortunately
this will not help.  No comment on the prostitutes of the article.

figures) and yes, you're right, 7000 haven't died, 7000 have been diagnosed.
	Concerning KS: it is just a tendency, it is after all an opportunistic
infection and therefore related to surroundings, and therefore the patients
one sees in Manhattan (primarily gay) and one sees here in the Bronx (IV)
tend to be different in regards to KS. It's a little stronger than that but
I don't think you can blame it all on the difference between the two boroughs.
	I don't read NY Native - they don't deliver to the Bronx, but
false negatives and positives occur with all tests. Immunoassays tend to be
very good. They also tend to improve with use, since better antigens are
found. According to Gallo, they've gotten the actual False Positives down 
to near nothing.
	There is another kind of False Positive however. 
	Remember, even if one comes out truely positive on the test, there is
still some debate on what that means. It either means:
	1) You have an active HTLV-3 infection and may get AIDS.
	2) You had an infection fought it off and are now naturally immunized
	  to AIDS
	3) You were exposed to it and now have antibodies to the virus.

	4) You were vaccinated against it.

From today's (28 December 1984) Chicago Tribune:
NEW YORK -- Scientists say they have found at least part of the
reason the AIDS virus targets a key immune system cell, and an expert 
on the disease says the discovery may help interfere with the infection
process.  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune 
system by killing a certain kind of white blood cell, and the research
demonstrates that the suspected virus latches on to a particular protein
on the surface of that cell to begin infection.  Dr. Robert Gallo, an
AIDS expert at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD, said 
identifying the ""receptor"" protein for the virus was significant.
""If you know a lot about the receptor, it opens up ideas you didn't
have before,"" he said Thursday.  ""You can start doing things that might
interfere with the virus infection of the cell.""

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

mechanism for AIDS & why only some people exposed to the pathogen
(whatever it is; NO ONE yet knows for sure) develop full-blown
AIDS.
They hypothesize that AIDS is transmitted by receiving T-cells
themselves from an infected person.  This results in the mild
AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and asymptomatic forms (ie, ""car-
riers"").  Full-blown AIDS occurs by receiving T-cells into
which the pathogen has injected genetic material.  This hypo-
thesis is really the first anyone's advanced which feasibly
explains the very puzzling selectivity of AIDS.
Has anyone else heard anything about this?  The US medical
establishment as usual seems hopelessly out of it.  Gallo's
HTLV-III find seems to be declining in signifigance as each
month passes.
The French see a lot of heterosexual cases traceable to Central
Africa.  The current NYNative has a long article on the intensive
African research that's just beginning, performed mainly by French
researchers, but with a half-dozen Americans participating.  The
author believes that the next 6 months of reports of African research
results will dispel once and for all any perceptions of AIDS as a
""gay disease"".
The current Native has other AIDS articles that show how complicated
the AIDS research picture has grown.  One physician in a Florida
town with a large Haitian population reports a high incidence of
HTLV III and a growing number of AIDS cases.  He believes that AIDS
is in fact KS, a relatively new or rare form, not the sluggish skin
cancer, but one which grows in lymph nodes & never appears externally.
His reasoning is that every AIDS patient doctors have thought to test
for the internal form of KS has displayed it, even patients who had 
the ""traditional"" external form of KS as well.
The HTLV-III blood test now seems virtually worthless.  The Native
reports that a large group of people who scored positive on it
showed negative results when another more reliable & much more 
expensive test for HTLV-III was used.
Furthermore, due to the lack of a guarantee of confidentiality
given to the 200,000 gay men who in good faith participated in
HTLV-III testing a few months ago,  large numbers are justifiably
refusing to be retested & thus seriously jeopardize the study's 
value.  Maybe now the federal medical bureaucracies will begin
to take their hippocratic oaths & professional ethics seriously
(maybe this will even inspire the ACLU or someone else to take
on the barbaric & grossly unconstitutional statutes which pass
for public health law in an epidemic, which few Americans know
anything about).
(So, as many physicians (including Curran of the CDC) advise, DON'T
TAKE THE HTLV-III TEST!!!!!!!  Its signifigance is UNKNOWN, it may
well be WORTHLESS, & leaves one open to serious discrimination &
abuse!  If you think you have symptoms and aren't well, seek a
competent & trustworthy physician (not necessarily easy to do),
PREFERABLY a gay doctor, who's AWARE of gay lifestyles & homopho-
bia; even then, don't automatically have the test: find out first
what if anything it can offer you and how it relates to your com-
plaints.  Marcus Welby is an utter myth!)

    though it were gospel? 
    Personally,  I  have  a lot of problems with  studies which seek a 
    single  ""causitive  factor""  (in this case a biological basis) for 
    just  about  anything.  Often, they use a small sample population, 
    and  use no control groups. They receive a great deal of attention 
    because they seem to be providing an easy ""scientific"" answer to a 
    complex  ""problem"".   This  particular  study  which  looks at the 
    mother's hormonial balance as a ""cause"" of homosexuality (blame it 
    **all**  on  mom...now  it's  her  hormones,  before  it  was  her 
    domineering  personality)  seems  to  look  only at gay men.  What 
    about  lesbians?  Why do so many ""scientific"" studies look only at 
    men, and then generalize about humanity? 
    Personally,  I  don't  care  if being gay is a ""result"" of what my 
    mother  ate  when she was pregnant, how she brought me up, or that 
    she was wearing blue when I was conceived. 
    What  I DO care about is that there is at least 10% of the world's 
    population  which defines itself as gay, and probably more who are 
    bisexual.   That  we have chosen to lead a life (NOT A LIFESTYLE!) 
    that  suits our needs and makes us HAPPY (one might even say *gay* 
    :-} ), is what is important.  I do not feel the need to justify my 
    life  through  ""scientific"", ""sociological"", or any other kinds of 
    studies. 
    I think  that  Heather Emanuel raised some good questions, though, 
    and I wanted to respond to two of them: 
                 >> == Heather Emanuel 
                 >>How  did  you all decide you were gay? 
                 >>Was it your own decision? 
    This  is the same question that a friend of long standing asked me 
    after  I  came  out  (I was 28 at the time, and none of my friends 
    ""suspected"", at least, not out loud). 
    For  *many*  people  it is more a question of finally admitting to 
    yourself  that  you  are gay, or recognizing the fact, rather than 
    ""deciding"".  What one can decide is to accept the fact, and choose 
    to  live your life as a gay man or lesbian; how you choose to live 
    is where the decision making comes in. 
    Remember  that  sexuality  is a continuum, it is not an either/or, 
    hetero/homo  ""fact"". There is a great deal of room on the contiuum 
    for  people to be celibate, bisexual; asexual, very sexual, sexual 
    only with men, only with women....etc. 
    Deciding to come out is hard for some people, easy for others.  It 
    took  me  28  years  because I had believed the stereo types about 
 
    gays  and took the homophonic remarks for truths. I was very homo- 
    phobic  before I came out, and ""knew"" that since I wasn't like the 
    stereo  types, I couldn't be ""one of them"".  Once I was willing to 
    see  myself  as gay, I was able to break through all that sh*t and 
    see  that  the stereo types were just not true.  I don't think you 
    have to come out to realize all this, but I think that you have to 
    be  willing  to  accept yourself and other people for who and what 
    you/they are. 
                 >>  All  I'm saying here is that I don't 
                 >>think it's the job of a parent to tell 
                 >>a child what his sexual preference is. 
                 >>Then  again, don't they really do that 
                 >>already   by   assuming   everyone  is 
                 >>heterosexual? 
    Yes.  Society  and  families ""tell"" children that they are hetero- 
    sexual from the moment they are born (and before).  It is a given. 
    Children  who do not feel ""that way"" are told that they are ""going 
    through  a phase"", that they will feel ""differently"" when they get 
    older.   Or,  worse  yet, they are told that they are sick and are 
    sent to shrinks or put into mental institutions (that happens less 
    today,  but  there were a great number of gay men and lesbians who 
    were  actually  committed  to  institutions  because they dared to 
    define their sexual preferences in a ""socially unacceptable"" way). 
    Heterosexuality  is  so  pervasive  in this society, while gay and 
    lesbian culture so invisible, that many people who are gay grow up 
    thinking  they must be the ""only one in the world"".  What a thrill 
    and relief to find out you are not alone...how sad for the gay men 
    and women who find it out late in life. 
    Heather:   If  you  have kids, do the best you can, and trust that 
    you have given them the best you have...after that, it's all up to 
    them.   No  parent,  no  matter  how  caring, how careful has ever 
    raised the ""perfect"" kid.

  Forty percent of the single men in San Francisco are homosexual, and most of
them are well-educated and earning more than $20,000 a year, according to a
professional survey.
  The survey by the Research and Decisions Corporation, commissioned by the
city-financed SF AIDS Foundation, was designed to produce the first reliable

[This section heavily condensed]
Of 706,900 SF'ers, 69,960 are homosexual (based on 500 half-hour interviews).
32% of homosexual men in SF earn more than $30K, with 31% earning $20-$30K.
57% graduated from college, incl. 21% who continued in post-grad education.
42% of homosexual men in SF report they are in monogamous relationships and
13% have one primary relationship that includes outside sexual activity.
78% have all-male sexual partners, 14% are bisexual with mostly male partners
and 7% are bisexual with mostly female partners.
More than half of the homosexual men are in professional-managerial positions
or operate their own businesses.  Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.
About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,
with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.
A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliability
of the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed off
to them because they're gay.""  However, he also noted that many affluent
homosexuals were moving into San Francisco.

I believe the 69,960 were ADULT, MALE SELF-DESCRIBED HOMOSEXUALS.
Non-adults were not surveyed.

It is important to note a few important things about that survey:
1) that the survey was NOT a random sample,
2) the 500 were TELEPHONE interviews and more than 10% of the 
   salaries reported have already been declared as inflated
   and the investigation has just begun...think about it -
   if you weren't making much money and someone asked you
   how much you were making, in a telephone interview, wouldn't
   you be inclined to inflate it a little bit???
Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms,
and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia
from growing up in a world determined to assume that
everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are
all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia -
like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the
view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia
could be used against us...
just a thought from a lesbian here in sf...

    Many different kinds of postings happen on our slightly improbable net.
Occaisional light banter in Danish is fun, if only for the absurdity of doing
such a thing. There is no real information anyway, so no harm is done.
    On t'other hand, any time I intend to convey information, I will
do it in a language my recipients understand. To do otherwise would be
self-defeating.
    This process is actually self-enforcing. Anybody who wants to be
listened to will discover sooner or later that it helps if your recipient
can understand what you say. If somebody is not interested in helping
you understand him/her even that much, you probably have little to lose
by ignoring her/him.
re: article that raised the issue:
    The first Spiegel article was interesting enough [to me] to read,
but not to translate. (sorry! The gist was that AIDS is alive and
well in the German Fed. Republic, affecting both men and women. I
don't remember whether they also broke it down by sexual preference.)
I skipped the second article because I get eyestrain from variable spacing
between words. (Was that for anybody who made it past the language barrier:-?)

Fed up sex expert charges...
GAYS ARE WORSE THAN MURDERERS
    Homosexuals are prancing around the U.S. spreading the most monstrous
plague the world has ever known, says an outraged sexuality expert.
And, he says, ""They're worse than murderers.""
    ""Gay meeting areas, gay bars, gay baths should be closed immediately
and it should be illegal to be a homosexual,"" said Dr. Paul Cameron.
    And homosexuals should be required by the government to register
so that their movements could be tracked to halt the growing threat
of AIDS ( the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ), gonorrhea,
syphilis and hepatitis, he said.
    Cameron, who has a Ph.D. degree in sociology from the
University of Colorado, is chairman of the Institute for
Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, Nebr. [ I wonder
if they investigate sexuality anywhere else? :-) ]
    ""Most murderers commit a crime and are punished, but gays are
promiscuous and do bad deeds constantly, and as such, are worse
than murderers.
    ""Whenever gays take over an organization, they trash it,"" he
said.  ""I haven't met one yet who wasn't a fairly vicious person.""
    Statistics put together by Cameron's institute reveal a
shocking 5 percent of America's 210 million population is
either bisexual or homosexual.
    Latest figures show an incredible rise in the number of
dreaded AIDS cases so far this year - 2,886 comapred to 1,390
this time last year, according to Cameron.
    ""AIDS is a horrible plague on society,"" said Cameron.
    ""A shocking 40 to 60 percent of all gays show evidence of
infection from the AIDS virus.
    ""This terrible desease is costing American taxpayers $7
million a week for treatment.""
    Cameron recently testified before the Maine Human Rights
Commission regarding a gay rights bill to stop job
discrimination against homosexuals in that state.
    ""Such a bill would give gays preferred status in jobs and
that would allow them to get a better crack at our kids, handle
our food and blood,"" he said.  ""It would legitimize people who
are doing something socially worthless.  And it ( the bill ) would
be of tremendous disservice to the homosexuals who might otherwise
be pressured by society to go straight.""
    Fortunately, Cameron told the NEWS, his only son is a normal,
healthy young man.
    ""We practice the Christian faith in our family and if my son were
gay, it would be one of the most horrible things that could happen,""
he said.  ""If it had happened, my son would be disowned.""

A Survey of the Criminal Laws of the United States
Affecting Homosexuals
by Daniel Meyer, Esq.
(This is the third installment of Dan Meyer's survey of the criminal
laws relating to homosexuality in the various states.  We continue our
review of the New England states with Massachusetts, which requires
enough discussion to carry over into the discussion next month.--Editor)
Massachusetts
Massachusetts has not by statute decriminalized consensual sexual acts
in private.  It *seems*, however, to have done so by judicial decisions
that hold that, as a matter of statutory construction, the provisions of
the criminal law against ""deviant"" sexual acts do not apply to such acts
when committed in private between consenting adults.  The word ""seems""
is used because the decisions are not absolutely clear.
1. The Question Whether Consensual Sexual Acts in Private Have Been
Decriminalized.
   A. The Statutes Prohibiting Deviant Sexual Acts.
The pertinent statutes are of ancient origin, as their rather archaic
language suggests, and are quoted here in full to show their extreme
vagueness and generality (except for the sodomy statute) which required
the courts, in order to save them from unconstitutionality for
vagueness, to delineate the specific acts within their purview, and
which afforded the courts the opportunity to exclude from their reach
consensual acts between adults in private.
The statutes in question are contained in Chapter 272 of the General
Laws of Massachusetts (G.L.c.272).  They read as follows (with emphasis
supplied to indicate the particular language held to prohibit deviant
sexual acts):
S 16. Lascivious Cohabitation and Lewdness.
A man and woman who, not being married to each other, lewdly and
lasciviously associate and cohabitate together, or *a man or woman,
married or unmarried, who is guilty of open and gross lewdness and
lascivious behavior*, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state
prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two
years or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.
S 34. Sodomy and Buggery.
Whoever commits the abominable and detestable crime against nature
either with mankind or with a beast, shall be punished by imprisonment
in the state prison for not more than twenty years.
S 35. Unnatural and Lascivious Acts.
Whoever commits *any unnatural and lascivious act with another person*
shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than
one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more
than five years or in jail or the house of correction for not more than
two and one half years.
S 53. Common Night Walkers, Common Railers and Brawlers, etc.
Common night walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers,
persons who with offensive and disorderly act or language accost or
annoy persons of the opposite sex, *lewd, wanton and lascivious persons
in speech or behavior*, idle and disorderly persons, prostitutes,
disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses and
persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a
jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine
of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
   B. The Cases Decriminalizing Consensual Acts in Private.
(1) Cases Under G.L.c.272, S 35.
The leading case is *Commonwealth v. Balthazar*, 318 N.E.2d 478 (Mass.
1974).  There, the complainant, a woman who had accepted a ride in the
defendant's car, charged that he had compelled her by threats to commit
fellatio on him and to put her ""tongue on his backside.""  The defendant
was convicted of committing an ""unnatural and lascivious act with
another person"" under G.L.c.272, S 35.  He argued on appeal that the
statute was unconstitutionally vague in not specifying the particular
acts to which it applied and also that the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that consent by the victim would bar a conviction
under S 35.
The Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the conviction holding that S
35 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the case because,
according to the Court, both earlier court decisions and contemporary
community standards sufficiently apprised the defendant that the
particular acts of which he was accused were considered ""unnatural and
lascivious"" within the meaning of S 35.  ""By compelling the victim to
put her mouth on his genitals and on his buttocks or anus, the defendant
sought sexual gratification in a manner which,"" according to the court,
""deviated from accepted conduct in the community."" 318 N.E.2d at 482.
The SJC went out of its way, however, in what was strictly speaking a
*dictum*, but a *dictum* that seems to have evolved into settled law, to
declare that, in the light of contemporary community values, ""...we
conclude that S 35 must be construed to be inapplicable to private
consensual conduct of adults.  We do so on the ground that the concept
of general community disapproval of specific sexual conduct, which is
inherent in S 35, requires such an interpretation.  We do not decide
whether a statute which explicitly prohibits specific sexual conduct,
even if consensual and private, would be constitutionally infirm."" 318
N.E.2d at 481.  The court did not express any opinion on the question
whether S 34, the sodomy statute, which explicitly prohibits specific
sexual conduct but does not, to be sure, expressly prohibit such conduct
when consensual and private, could be limited by statutory construction
to exclude consensual acts between adults in private.
The SJC's declaration that S 35 is inapplicable to consensual acts in
private would seem to have supported the defendant's claim that the
trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the victim's
consent would bar a conviction under that section.  The SJC held,
however, that even assuming the acts in question occurred in private,
the defendant was precluded from asserting the defense of consent in the
SJC because he had failed at the trial to request such an instruction or
to take exception to the trial judge's failure so to charge.
Thereafter, the defendant sought habeus corpus in the federal courts on
the ground that S 35 was unconstitutionally vague.  *Balthazar v.
Superior Court*, 428 F.Supp.425 (D.Mass. 1977), *aff'd*, 573 F.2d 698
(1st Cir. 1978).  The district court granted the writ and reversed the
conviction, and was affirmed on appeal.  Those decisions were based on a
finding that although the SJC had narrowed the scope of S 35 by
excluding from its reach private consensual conduct, the section was
nevertheless unconstitutionally vague at the time of the defendant's
alleged acts because its broad and general language had not been defined
specifically to apply to the conduct complained of.  However, the
district court declared (428 F.Supp. at 434):
	The court is not willing, however, to hold that Mass.
	Gen.Laws ch. 272, S 35 is invalid today merely because
	it was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner in
	July of 1972.  Much has transpired in the courts of 
	the Commonwealth since the date of the petitioner's
	alleged conduct, which  has lent specificity and meaning
	to a once ambiguous statute.  The most significant
	occurrence came in *Commonwealth v. Deschamps*,
	294 N.E.2d 426 (Mass.App.Ct. 1972), where fellatio was
	held to constitute an unnatural act.  Other recent
	cases have definitively applied S 35 to specific
	conduct.  *Commonwealth v. LaBella*, 364 Mass. 550,
	306 N.E.2d 813 (1974) (applying S 35 to cunnilingus).
	Furthermore, as was previously discussed, S 35 was
	significantly altered by the Supreme Judicial Court's
	opinion in *Balthazar*, limiting the statute's
	reach to non-consensual conduct.  The clear impact
	of these decisions was to put the public on notice
	that S 35 forbids specific types of non-consensual
	sexual conduct, including fellatio.
In *Commonwealth v. Reilly, 363 N.E.2d 1126 (Mass.App. 1977), the court,
citing *Balthazar*, squarely held that ""consensual conduct in private
between adults is not prohibited by... S 35..."" and that the refusal of
the trial judge so to charge constituted reversible error.  *See also,
Commonwealth v. Scagliotti*, 371 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. 1977).
(2) Cases Under G.L.c.272, SS 16 and 53.
In *Commonwealth v. Templeman*, 381 N.E.2d 1300 (mass. 1978), the agreed
facts, based largely on the testimony of the victim, were that the
defendant had intercourse at home with his 16 year old stepdaughter.
According to her testimony, she has has intercourse with the defendant
on a number of prior occasions but had never participated willingly or
consented.  The defendant was prosecuted for rape,  for ""open and gross
lewdness and lascivious behavior"" under S 16 and for being a ""lewd,
wanton and lascivious person in speech or behavior"" under S 53.  He was
acquitted of rape, but convicted under SS 16 and 53.  On appeal, the
defendant argued that he was convicted on duplicitous indictments and
that the charge under S 16 should therefore be dismissed.  He also urged
that the S 53 charge should be dismissed as unconstitutionally vague.
The SJC held that, although S 53 can apply to sexual conduct, ""...if
sexual acts for hire are not involved, there must be conduct that is
'public'..."" 381 N.E.2d at 1303.  Consequently, it reversed the
conviction under S 53.  However, it affirmed the conviction under S 16
saying: ""No argument is made that there was any error in the conviction
of 'open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior' under G.L.c.272, S
16, except for the claim that the two indictments were duplicitous.  The
history of S 16 is quite separate from that of S 53, and our cases give
adequate warning that S 16 could be applied to conduct like that of the
defendant."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  The court then cited *Commonwealth v.
Lucas*, 126 N.E.2d 804 (Mass. 1955), in which a defendant was convicted
of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior for committing a
sexual act in private with his daughter, less than 14 years of age, and
*Commonwealth v. Wardell*, 128 Mass. 52 (1880), in which a defendant was
convicted of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior for
exhibiting his ""private parts"" in a private house, not his own, in the
presence of an 11 year old girl and a child of 4.  After citing *Lucas*
and *Wardell*, the court in *Templeman* went on to say: ""Contrast
*Commonwealth v. Catlin*, 1 Mass. 8, 9-10 (consensual conduct of adults
in private)."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  In *Catlin*, the appellate court
reversed the conviction of a married man for open and gross lewdness and
lascivious behavior for lying in bed in private with a woman who was not
his wife on the ground that ""...*secret and private lewdness* and
lascivious behavior...cannot in any degree support the charge in the
indictment."" (Emphasis in original; 1 Mass. at 10.)
The question that concerns us is whether the affirmance of the
defendant's conviction under S 16 in *Templeman* is a holding or even an
indication that the prohibition in that section against ""open and gross
lewdness and lascivious behavior"" covers consensual acts between adults
in private.  The following factors in the case suggest that S 16 might
be construed to cover such acts: First, the court's decision dismissing
the conviction under S 53 was a square holding that the incident
occurred in private.  Second, the acquittal on the rape charge shows
that the jury found that the victim consented in fact.  Third, the
victim was 16 years old and, accordingly, capable of effectively
consenting to ""normal"" sexual intercourse, which is all that seems to
have occurred in this case.  (See G.L.c.265, S 23, and discussion below
regarding the question of consent.)  Other factors, however, indicate
that the affirmance of the conviction under S 16 does not mean that
consensual acts between adults in private are within the reach of that
section: First, the primary ground for the affirmance of the S 16
conviction was that""...no argument is made that there was any error in
the conviction...except for the claim that the two indictments were
duplicitous..."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  Second, after citing *Lucas* and
*Wardell*, in which the victims were under the age of 14 and, in once
[sic] case, the defendant's daughter, the court ""contrasted"" the
*Catlin* case, stating that it involved ""consensual conduct of adults in
private.""
The opinion in *Templeman* is rather muddled.  A reasonable explanation
of it seems to be that the court, without expressly saying so, was moved
by the relationship between the actor (father) and the victim (16 year
old stepdaughter) (See Model Penal Code, S 213.3(1)(b)), and that the
decision, insofar as it may hold that S 16 can apply to sexual acts in
private where there has been consent in fact, does not go beyond the
particular facts of the case, namely, a situation where the victim is
young and where, in the words of the Model Penal Code, the actor ""...is
his guardian or otherwise responsible for general supervision of his
welfare...""  So viewed, the holding in *Templeman* in affirming the S 16
conviction is simply that, in view of the ages and relationship of the
parties, consent in fact did not constitute effective consent as a
matter of law.  The court's failure to base its decision expressly on
this ground is easily understood; for, had it done so, the defendant
could have raised the constitutional question that the broad language of
S 16 had not been defined specifically to apply to the conduct
complained of.  In accord in limiting the reach of S 53 to conduct
committed in a public place is *Commonwealth v. Sefranka*, 414 N.E.2d
602 (Mass. 1980).
(3) The case under G.L.c.272, S 34.
Section 34 has been construed to forbid anal intercourse and bestiality.
*Commonwealth v. Gallant*, 369 N.E.2d 707, 714 (mass. 1977).  It seems
on its face to apply broadly to all acts of anal intercourse, both
public and private.  However, the SJC seems to have declared
unequivocally that adult consent is a defense to a prosecution for
sodomy in private.  *Commonwealth v.Manning*, 328 N.E.2d 496 (Mass.
1975).  In *Manning*, the defendant was convicted of rape, sodomy,
unnatural and lascivious acts, and assault and battery.  Although the
opinion of the SJC does not cite the particular sections of the law
under which the defendant was convicted, it states that he was sentenced
to a term of 5 to 7 years on the conviction for sodomy.  This means that
the sodomy conviction must have been under G.L.c.272, S 34, because SS
16, 35, and 53, the only other sections that might cover sodomy, provide
for shorter maximum terms of imprisonment.
In the appeals court in *Manning*, the defendant urged that the trial
court had erroneously excluded evidence of the complainant's poor
reputation for chastity.  The appeals court reversed the conviction for
rape on the ground that the defendant's reputation for chastity was
relevant to the question of her consent, but it upheld the convictions
for sodomy and unnatural acts on the ground that the excluded testimony
bore only on the question of consent, not veracity.  The SJC reversed
the convictions for sodomy and unnatural acts on the ground that if the
evidence of complainant's poor reputation for chastity had persuaded the
jury that rape did not take place and that the complainant had testified
falsely as to that, the jury might well have disbelieved the complainant
in her further uncorroborated testimony that sodomy and unnatural acts
had occurred.  The Court concluded as follows (328 N.E.2d at 501):
	Disposing of the case as we do, we need not go into any
	phase of the defendant's second contention, that, since
	our recent decision in Commonwealth v. Balthazar,
	318 N.E.2d 478 (1974), interpreted the unnatural acts
	statute to admit adult consent as a defense, reversal
	of his conviction is now required because the excluded
	evidence of the complainant's poor reputation for
	chastity was directly relevant in refuting the charges
	of sodomy and unnatural acts.  *While the consent 
	defense will be open to the defendant on a retrial*, we
	do not now undertake to decide whether a poor reputation
	for chastity, as distinguished from a reputation
	for engaging in the particular acts charged, is
	admissible to show consent as a defense to a charge
	of sodomy or unnatural acts. [Emphasis supplied]
C. Conclusion
It has been squarely held that the prohibition in G.L.c.272, S 35,
against ""unnatural and lascivious acts"" and the penalties imposed by S
35 upon ""lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior"" do
not apply where the acts in question are consensual and in private.  The
exclusion of private consensual acts from the reach of S 16 (""open and
gross lewdness and lascivious behavior"") and of S 34 (sodomy) is not
quite so certain but seems highly probable.  On balance, it seems safe
to say that sexual acts between consenting adults in private have been
decriminalized in Massachusetts.

Massachusetts
(Part II)
II. Consent
    A. The Age Below Which Actual Consent Does Not Constitute Effective
Consent.  The statutes are inconsistent.  GLc.265. S 23 provides:
Rape of Child.  Whoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural
sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen years of age shall,
for the first offense, be punished by imprisonment in the state prison
for life or for any term of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for
any term in a jail or house of correction, and for the second or
subsequent offense by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for
any term of years, but not less than five years.
GLc.272, S 35A provides:
Unnatural, etc., Acts with Child Under Sixteen.  Whoever commits any
unnatural and lascivious act with a child under the age of sixteen shall
be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more
than five years or in jail or the house of correction for not more than
two and one half years, and whoever over the age of eighteen commits a
second or subsequent offence [sic] shall be sentenced to imprisonment in
the state prison for a term of not less than five years.
GLc.272, S 4 provides:
Enticing to Unlawful Intercourse.  Whoever induces any person under
eighteen of chaste life to have unlawful sexual intercourse shall be
punished as provided in the preceding section.  [I.e., imprisonment for
not more than three years or fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, or
both.]
The general provisions of law defining ""minority"" and ""majority"" provide
that a person under 18 is a minor and becomes an adult at 18 (GLc.4, S
7, defs. 48-51).  Relying on these general provisions and apparently on
the Supreme Judicial Court's (SJC) use of the word ""adults"" in *C. v.
Balthazar*, the court in *C. v. Fleurant*, 372 N.E.2d 542 (Mass.App.
1978), held that ""minors,"" i.e., persons under 18, are presumed to be
incapable of giving consent to unnatural and lascivious acts and that,
therefor, where all the victims of the various offenses for which the
defendant was convicted were under 18, it was not necessary to reach the
question whether the acts were committed in private.  As the prosecution
was under GLc.272, S 35A (the only penal statute cited in the opinion),
it is strange that the court held 18 to be the ""age of consent"" because
S 35A only prohibits the proscribed conduct with person under 16.  The
court did not mention S 4, which prohibits inducing persons under 18 to
have unlawful sexual intercourse.  But in a prosecution under that
section it would have to be proved that the victims were ""of chaste
life,"" an unlikely situation these days.
In *C. v. Zeitler*, 389 N.E.2d 423 (Mass.App. 1979), a prosecution under
GLc.272. S 35, the court was faced with the question whether a person 16
or 17 years old can consent to an ""unnatural act.""  The court declared
(at 427-28):
	It is clear that a person under the age of sixteen
	cannot give such consent (GLc. 272. S 35A) and that a
	person who has attained the age of eighteen can.
	GLc.4, S 7, forty-ninth... Despite our holding in
	*C. v. Fleurant*... a majority of the panel are of the
	belief that there is a serious question as to
	whether it is the law that a person between sixteen
	and eighteen who can consent to any of the panoply of
	acts which constitute sexual intercourse...can also 
	consent to those acts which have been or may be
	classified as 'unnatural and lascivious' under
	GLc.272. SS 35 and 35A...""
The court certified this question to the SJC prior to a retrial of the
case.  The defendant's prosecution under S 35 was thereafter dropped,
the case motted, and the question left unanswered.
    B. Other Circumstances Under Which Actual Consent Does Not
Constitute Effective Consent.
       1. Persons Under the Influence of Drugs.  It seems reasonably
certain that the actual consent of a person under the influence of drugs
or intoxicants administered by the actor would not constitute effective
consent, pursuant to GLc. 272, S 3 (which includes a penalty of
imprisonment for no more than three years in the state prison or two and
one half years in the house of correction, or fine of not more than one
thousand dollars, or by both).
       2. Persons Under the Control of [sic--or] Domination of Others.
No statute or cases have been found dealing explicitly with whether the
actual consent to a sexual act of a victim who is under the control or
domination of the actor (e.g., prisoner and guard) constitutes effective
consent.  However, the decision in *C. v. Templeman, supra*, seems best
explained as a holding, not expressly articulated, that the actual
consent of the defendant's 16 year old step-daughter to sexual
intercourse with him was not effective consent because of his dominant
position with respect to her. (see Part I. Section B. para. 2. above)
In what other areas the courts may hold that actual consents are
ineffective where the consenting victim is under the domination of the
actor is a matter of speculation.
    C. Consent Under the Assault Statutes.
It is clear that the  terms ""unnatural sexual intercourse,"" ""unnatural
and lascivious acts"" and ""unlawful sexual intercourse"" as used in
GLc.265. S 23 and in c.272, SS 35A and 4, include sodomy, fellatio,
cunnilingus, mouth to anal contact and ""other intrusions [other than
""normal"" vaginal intercourse] of a part of a person's body or other
object into the genital or anal opening of another person's body."" (See:
*C. v. Gallant*. 369 N.E.2d 707. 712. 714 (Mass. 1977); *C. v. Manning*,
328 N.E.2d 496, 497, 499 (Mass. 1975); *C. v. Deschamps*, 294 N.E.2d 426
(Mass. 1972); *C. v. LaBella*, 306 N.E.2d 813 (mass. 1974); *C. v.
Balthazar*, 318 N.E.2d 478, 482 (Mass. 1974); *C. v. LaMay*, 369 N.E.2d
1036 (Mass.App. 1977).)  Whether those terms as used in those statutes
include other acts deliberately committed for sexual gratification, such
as the touching of genital areas (hereinafter called ""sexual contacts""),
is not clear.  The court in *C. v. Zeitler* stated (389 N.E.2d at 427)
that only the acts listed above fall within the terms ""unnatural and
lascivious"" acts.  It is uncertain whether the same result would be
reached in a case of sexual contacts between persons of the same sex.
Whether such sexual contacts fall within the scope of GLc. 265, S 23 or
c.272. SS 35, 35A, or 4, it appears that one who commits a sexual
contact upon another in the absence of effective consent is guilty of
assault and battery under c.265. SS 13A (Assault and Assault and
Battery), 13B (Indecent Assault and Battery on Child Under Fourteen),
13F (Indecent Assault and Battery on Mentally Retarded Person) or 13H
(Indecent Assault and Battery on Person Aged Fourteen or Older).  These
crimes are variously punishable by imprisonment for periods of two and a
half to five years, or, in the case of S 13A, by a fine of not more than
$500.
In *C. v. Burke*, (Mass., 11/22/83, not yet reported), the defendant was
prosecuted under S 13B and found guilty of assault and battery upon a
female child under age 14.  The District Court, faced with what it
considered the novel issue of whether evidence of the child's consent
should be admitted as material upon retrial, reported this question to
the SJC, among others: ""Is lack of consent an element of the offense of
indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years
proscribed by...S 13B..?""  In responding, the SJC summarized the law as
follows:  (1) A physically harmful or potentially harmful touching is
always a battery, and consent is immaterial;  (2) A non-harmful touching
is a battery only if there was no consent;  (3) In a prosecution for
assault and battery for a non-harmful touching, the Commonwealth bears
the burden of proving absence of consent;  (4) S 13B does not establish
age 14 as the ""age of consent"" below which actual consent is immaterial
because ineffective, but merely provides a penalty for the nonconsensual
touching of a person under 14 more severe than that provided for the
nonconsensual touching of a person 14 or over;  (5) The capacity of the
alleged victim to consent is a question of fact to be determined by the
trier of fact.  In making such a determination, the age of the child is
crucial, but other factors, such as intelligence, maturity and
experience may be considered.
Assuming that these principles would apply in a prosecution under S 13F
for indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person, a nice
question remains:  Would proof of mental retardation in any degree be
sufficient, *ipso facto*, to establish the alleged victim's incapacity
to consent effectively, or would it remain for the trier of fact to
weigh the degree of mental retardation along with other relevant factors
in determining the question whether actual consent was effective?
*Burke* suggests that the alleged victim's capacity to consent
effectively should be determined by the trier of fact on the basis of
all relevant factors.
The rule stated in *Burke* is well illustrated in *C. v. Appleby*, 402
N.E.2d 1051 (Mass. 1980), in which it was held that actual consent of a
sexual partner to an act of violence in an S&M relationship does not
protect the actor from liability for assault and battery.  In *Appleby*,
the defendant, one of two male sexual partners, hit his partner with a
riding crop and, upon complaint of the victim, was prosecuted for
assault and battery.  The defense was that the act was a sexual act in
private to which the victim had consented and was therefore lawful under
*Balthazar*.  In affirming the conviction, the SJC held (402 N.E.2d at
1060-61): ""The fact that violence may be related to sexual activity (or
may even be sexual activity to the person inflicting pain on another as
[the defendant] testified) does not prevent the State from protecting
its citizens against physical harm.  The invalidity of the victim's
consent to a battery by means of a dangerous weapon would be the same,
however, whether or not the battery wa related to sexual activity.""
III. Privacy
No statute has been found defining what is public and private, but the
cases are illuminating.  The SJC stated the rule in general terms as
follows:
	The rationale of GLc.272. S 35 is to prevent the
	open flouting of community standards regarding sexual
	matters...  The statutory object is to prevent the
	possibility that the defendant's conduct might give
	offense to persons present in a place frequented by
	members of the public for reasons of business,
	entertainment or the like...  However, the statute is
	not designed to punish persons who desire privacy
	and who take reasonable measures to secure it...  The
	essential query is whether the defendant intended
	public exposure or recklessly disregarded a
	substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons...
	Conduct is not established as public merely because
	another person observes the conduct...  The
	Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being
	observed by casual passersby must have been
	reasonably forseeable by the defendant, or stated
	otherwise, that the defendant acted upon an
	unreasonable expectation that his conduct would
	remain secret.  [*C. v. Ferguson*, N.E.2d 1365, 1367
	(Mass. 1981)]
In *Ferguson*, the defendant on a very cold night picked up a woman in
his car and drove to the rear of a dark, public parking lot where the
woman performed consensual fellatio upon him.  Police who observed the
pick-up followed the defendant into the parking lot, shone a flashlight
into the car, and arrested both persons.  The defendant was convicted
under S 35 or committing an unnatural and lascivious act.  After
reviewing in detail the evidence bearing on the question whether the
defendant should reasonably have forseen that the conduct might be
observed by casual passersby, the SJC concluded that the prosecution had
failed to prove its case and gave judgement for the defendant.  Three
justices dissented.  They agreed that ""it is incumbent upon the
Commonwealth to prove that the act occurred in a public place,"" but
suggested ""that there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in a
case like this where an automobile maneuvers in an urban area,"" and
added ""that the defendants similarly situated in future cases, may not
take much comfort from the instant case, since it seems clear...that the
majority opinion is suggesting that  the Commonwealth could have made
its case with a few easily provable, added facts."" 422 N.E.2d at 1369.
In *C. v. Scagliotti*, 371 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. 1977), the defendant was
convicted of the common law crime of soliciting a person to commit a
felony, namely, an unnatural and lascivious act with another person
under S 35.  The events took place in a ""mini-movie"" theater that
exhibits sexually explicit films in small cubicles.  The defendant
entered a cubicle where a detective was standing and offered to perform
an ""unnaturla act.""  The cubicle accommodated two persons, and when its
door was closed a red light warned other persons not to enter.  In
reversing the conviction and remanding the case for a new trial, the SJC
held that the trial judge had erred in instructing the jury that the
cubicle was a public place as a matter of law, and declared:
	A consensual unnatural act must be committed in a
	public place in order to be punishable under...S 35...
	The public nature of the consensual act is an
	essential element to be proved by the prosecution...
	[The] testimony [on the issues of whether the cubicle
	in fact afforded privacy] was susceptible to
	conflicting interpretations, and where inferences
	might be drawn from the testimony upon a certain
	point, the question must be submitted to the jury...
371 N.E.2d at 727.
IV. Solicitation
The defendant in *C. v. Scagliotti* was convicted of soliciting another
to commit an unnatural and lascivious act under S 35.  The SJC stated
the issue before it to be simply ""whether the defendant had offered to
commit the act in a public place,"" and it held that if a jury found that
the defendant's offer was to commit the act in a private place, the
defendant could not be convicted.
In *C. v. Sefranka*, 414 N.E.2d 602 (Mass. 1980), the defendant was
convicted of being a ""lewd, wanton and lascivious person in speech or
behavior"" in violation of c.272. S 53.  The undisputed facts were that
the defendant, who had parked his car in a rest area of a public road,
approached a plainclothes detective in an unmarked car in the rest area,
and invited the officer to return with him to his house for oral
copulation.  The officer refused to leave the rest area indicating that
he wanted the sexual activity to take place there.  The defendant said
it was not safe at the rest area and drove away, and was arrested soon
after.  The SJC reversed the conviction on the ground that the ""lewd,
wanton and lascivious persons"" provision ""was unconstitutionally vague
as construed by our past decision in effect at the time of the
defendant's conviction.""  It construed the provision ""to prohibit only
the commission of conduct in a public place, or the public solicitation
of conduct to be performed in a public place, when the conduct committed
or solicited involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks or female
breasts, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense, by a
person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons
who may be offended by the conduct."" 414 N.E.2d at 608.
It should be noted, however, that the provision of S 53 prohibiting
""common night walkers, both male and female"" was held to cover the
solicitation of one who is abroad at night of people to have ""illicit
sexual intercourse"" without in any way excluding the solicitation of
acts to be conducted in private in the earlier case of *Thomas v. C.*,
243 N.E.2d 821 (Mass. 1969).  Such pertinent facts as whether Thomas was
convicted on the basis of one, a few or many solicitations, and whether
the acts solicited were to be performed in private, do not appear from
the opinion.  Since the decision in *Balthazar*, it seems unlikely that
one could be convicted as a common nightwalker for one public
solicitation for the commission of a sexual act in private where no
compensation is to be paid by one party to the other (see section on
prostitution, below).
Also notable is *Riegle v. Terrazzi*, 417 N.E.2d 1227 (Mass.App. 1981),
in which a reporter for Gay Community News (Boston) sought a preliminary
injunction against a police campaign to suppress sexual activity in the
men's room of the Boston Public Library.  The reporter alleged that the
police had engaged in provocative sexual activity to entrap people, and
that when plaintiff stood outside the men's room to get information for
a news story, the police had ordered him away on threat of arrest.  The
Appeal Court affirmed the denial of injunctive relief, stating that the
record furnished no basis for finding abuse of discretion by the police.
The court stated, however, that upon a more complete record ""there later
may be presented questions concerning a proper balance between  (a)
protecting the access of Gay Community News to information of obvious
interest to its readers, and  (b) proper police operations to suppress
what may be either criminal activity (GLc.272, S 16) or an ongoing
nuisance.""  The court indicated that an adequate presentation of
evidence ought to include ""(a) the extent of any nuisance created by
users of, or by misconduct in, the men's room of the Library;  (b) any
specific misconduct, such as entrapment or provocation, or other
inappropriate behavior, by the police...;  (c) whether... reporters
could proceed with their operations without obstruction or embarrassment
of proper police operations;...  (d) any unreasonable harm to Riegle or
his employer."" 417 N.E.2d at 1229.
V. Prostitution
The only statute that deals with prostitution is the provision of
GLc.272, S 53 penalizing ""common night walkers,"" prostitutes, etc.  In
*C. v. King*, 272 N.E.2d 196 (Mass. 1977), female prostitutes convicted
under this section appealed alleging the statute unconstitutionally
discriminated against women because female prostitutes were prosecuted
while male prostitutes and male customers of prostitutes were not.  The
SJC affirmed the conviction on the ground that S 53 applies to male
prostitutes as well as female prostitutes and that there was no evidence
in the record of discriminatory enforcement.  It concluded that the law
did not punish persons who hire or seek to hire another to engage in
sexual activity but held that this did not violate the defendants'
constitutional right to equal protection because ""S 53 was designed to
attack merely one phase of the problem,"" and ""the legislature may select
one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting others."" 372
N.E.2d at 203-04.
VI. Penalties.  Penalties under those statutes which remain enforceable
are as discussed in connection with each statute.
[NOTE: Gay Community News reporter Larry Goldsmith informs me that since
this document was originally written, the SJC wrote an opinion upholding
c.272, S 14 (adultery): *C. v. Judith Stowell*.  The SJC also apparently

on child under 14-- G.L.c.265, S 13B).]","gjQBLRNpPuAJ",11,1984-11-13,-102,19

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

			PART SIX
[NYNative, 8/29-9/11/83, S. Christopher Hagsch, ""CDC May Be Shaving
Figures"", p. 8]
A source within CDC's AIDS project said AIDS cases figures ""are inaccurate
for many states because Dr. Brandt [Assistant Secretary, Health & Human
Services, HHS] wants it that way.  Less money will be appropriated for
research if the numbers are smaller.""
(Note this is against a background of chronic underfunding of AIDS efforts
even for the most rudimentary projects.)
For example, in July (1983) Tennessee reported 8 confirmed cases, but the
CDC monthly tally claimed 2.  Four of the 8 victims had died as of July!
In June Tennessee reported 5, CDC claimed only 2.  In August, CDC still
claimed only 2 cases!
CDC Public Affairs office spokesperson Chuck Fallis speculated ""I don't
know [what is causing the discrepancy].  My best guess is... a time lag.""
A two-month time-lag, he was asked?  ""I don't know.""
On August 18th the Texas Public Health Dept. reported 62 AIDS cases, but
CDC claimed there were only 47.
CDC credibility was low enough & the discrepancies large enough that
NGTF and Weiss & his HSGOH  said they ""might poll the states"" directly
themselves to find what the actual figures were!
There had been problems from the beginning with CDC reporting: the basic
information (number & distirbution of cases) needed to do any serious
planning or writing of budget proposals to obtain funds was not being 
reliably gathered & reported by CDC, & they revealed little incentive
to obtain the information.

against gays might be a plus for (as he described it)
	    those only marginally committed to this 
	    particular brand of self-destruction.
Now, Mr. Brunson, we are not talking anywhere near here about some
wishy-washy homosexual who cannot make up his mind about whether or
not he *really* likes spending lots of time in bed with other guys.
We are talking about hard-core gay MEN.  And hard-core bisexuals.
And hard-core lesbians.
Just who do you think you are talking to Mr. Brunson?
	Does GOD read USENET?
You are wasting your time here.  There are very few sexual sinners out
there that are marginally committed.  Unless you consider a little oral
sex from another guy occasionally (you know, when you're hard up) . . .
(And so drunk that to call it a memory would really be a cause for concern.)
People, gay people even, don't go around saying:  ""Geez, you know, life
might be a lot easier for me if I just gave up this whole gay thing.""
WELL, maybe if ALL your friends said you were BiB (Boring in Bed) you
might wanna see if women found your assets more pleasing.  But, NOBODY
thinks that discrimination in any way has prevented homosexuality from
becoming the grand old pastime that it is.  And why?  I'll tell you.
You see, they've done these studies that showed that the incidence of
homosexuality is roughly a constant 10% -- in any old cultures you
happen to choose.  Yes, you heard me.  And some of those cultures are
probably more intolerant than the one we live in, and some are probably
pretty good places for gay people like us to hang out (but those cultures
probably don't have compact disc players so I'll stay right here thank you).
SO, your being mean to those ""sexual sinners"" isn't likely to have much
effect on what people choose to do in bed, or even how often they choose
to do it.  BUT, it will have an effect, yes sirree!  (Don't doubt that.)
The effect will be thus:  Your son would never share his gayness with you.
Not only that, lots of other sons (and daughters!) would never tell the
parents they loved for so long about this thing which they feel would drive
apart their cherished family unit.  Got That?  So you wanna know how you
can tell if your beloved johnny is gay.  See how much he talks to you,
Mr. Brunson.  Does he often stay out late saying that he was spending time
""with friends.""  Would you rather believe that than the truth that dare not
enter your mind?  (An aside to believers: Let alone speak its name.)
The point is this, Mr. Brunson.  You can't get rid of homosexulity.  Believe
me, I've tried.  But, you can drive it underground and into the bushes.  You
might find that more appealing to your well-defined moral sense.  You know,
Out of My Sight, Out of My Mind.  (""I don't see anyone starving in America!"")
What do you want, Mr. Brunson?  An America were homosexuals are free to meet
in classy, chic restaurants   or   an America where you have no idea of what
someone does for a living until after the fact.  You decide.
By the way, Book Burning is never a good idea.  I can't think of any ideas
(not even Book Burning, *surprise*!) which I wouldn't want my kids exposed
to.  Unless of course my kids were stupid and believed every damn piece of
parchment they laid their eyes on.  But then, that would be their problem,
right?
You think things out so well, but you miss the big picture.  The exact same
books you use to claim that being gay is a ""sexual sin.""  Say that
	Thou shalt not spill his seed upon the ground.
	(or stain the sheets!)
Now tell me, Mr. Brunson, do  YOU  think masturbation is a sin?
Do YOU ask for    the forgiveness of GOD    every time YOU have a little
party with your right hand?
I think your answer to this would settle the whole issue once and for all.
Anyone, and I mean even you, who thinks that masturbation is a sin is,
pardon the term, a certified quack.  Even Dear Abby says it O.K. for the
guys to play with their peters.  On the other hand (!), if you think . . .
(dare I say it) ONANISM is a fine and dandy pursuit THEN how do you square
this with your firmly held convictions regarding what is and what isn't a
""sexual sin.""  I mean, who makes up these rules anyway, masturbaters?
Yes, what DO you do about those hard-core Jerk-Offs.  You know, the ones
that ask you for money in skid row.  If you give them a fin they're just
gonna pop into the nearest peep show and get they're rocks off.  You're
better of giving them a Nature's Valley Granola Bar.
	    If the sinner,
	    the enemy of righteousness,
	    the liar against the truth,
	    the defiler of those things that are holy and good,
	    needs food, then feed him.
I don't know about you but the only thing I defile that's ""holy and good""
is this pair of briefs that I stole from my first in college.
Actually, you've completely lost all your credibility in this group already.
What I'm telling you is that the onanism point is moot, don't waste your time
on it.  Your faux pas came when you so thoughtlessly recommended that
    all of the French existentialist literature
be destroyed in a pyromaniacal Book-Burning orgy.  You brute, you.
	    On the other hand sexual sins: fornication,
	    homosexuality, incest, adultery, bestiality,
	    are always, under all circumstances, inherently evil.
WHAT!  FORNICATION, inherently evil!  This I've gotta see!  I mean, like,
where would you and your kids (not to mention your wife) be without . . .
you know, the thing you close the door for.  I mean, what the hell, if
fornication is just as bad as homosexuality I might as well give this gay
thing a whirl.  I mean, fornication usually gets a pretty high rating from most
people, right up there with watching DYNASTY (a bad combination by the way).
	    Once again, can anyone give me any kind of reason
	    (even a ""logical"" one) why I should be treated as
	    a criminal for refusing to associate with homosexuals?
Aw, come on now, Mr. Brunson.  Don't be such a party pooper, associate with
us.  What are you afraid of, disease?  How old are you anyway?  You don't
come here that often do you?  I promise to be gentle.  You know what, I
think you're the type that would really go for this.  (Are you a talker?)
You know, I think we could have a lot of fun together if only you'd loosen
up a little.  Don't be such a tightass!  Relax -- you'll get your turn.
Here, smell this.  It's only poppers.  That's right.
Hey, Mr. Brunson, I really apologize for playing with you like this, but
you gotta admit, You Asked For It.  You really did.  So I just gave it to
you.  What are ya gonna do now, run home and complain to mommy?  You'll
be lucky enough to find a chair you can sit on.  No hard feelings I hope.

Complaints about Ken Arndt in net.motss tend to take one (or all) of
three directions: he's not supportive, he's unintelligible, or he's
rude.  In response to the complaint that he's rude and unsupportive,
some have argued that he appears to be knowledgable and perhaps, at
times, even reasonable. In response to such responses, others have
denied the possibility that he may be reasonable, argued that his
rudeness is the main point to be considered, and/or suggested that he
attempt to become intelligible that his points, if there be any besides
a hypothetical one atop his head, be better understood.
Let me reject the ""not supportive"" complaint out of hand; why someone
must be supportive to be heard escapes my understanding. (After all,
I tolerate liberals in net.politics -- though it appears some have
great difficulty tolerating me.) And I think that most net.motss
readers, gay and otherwise, agree. (Let me also reject the complaint
not noted above, that he has no answers to the problems he raises.
Who does?) Leaving, of the three types of complaints I noted, that he
is frequently unintelligible and rude.
On to intelligibility. I frequently find such luminaries as Sartre,
Connell, Eliot, Hamsun, Lagerkvist, Pynchon, Brecht, Ionesco, and
Baudelaire... unintelligible. On the other hand, I sometimes find
them intelligible, which sustains me in reading their works. And I
have found that it is generally true that just that which makes them
so often unintelligible makes their message, when I am hit with it,
so forceful. Now, one need not include Ken in the list above -- i.e.,
as of the same rank -- to consider the possibility that his style suits
him as the best to get across his points. To make a point, it may
sometimes be necessary to strike the listener in the face with a dead
fish. Would you reduce the efforts of, say, Ionesco to that which would
fit on a bumper sticker? (It would save a lot of trees; ""The Lesson""
could be reduced to ""Communication is Fraught with Difficulty,"" and
certainly everyone would understand that communication.) Would
you wait till the author died, and read the books of criticism about
the author's work? It's usually easier than reading the work itself.
Would you have the author write an essay as dull as this one (albeit
in better prose, no doubt)? Or would you admit the possibility that the
author embedded his meaning as much in the form of his work as in the
words? That in order to understand it, you had to do more than
intellectualize? (I remember, from Personality Theory or Abnormal
Psychology, when the professor explained ""intellectualization"" as
the defense mechanism which enabled 150 male students to hear him say
something like ""All males hate their fathers because they secretly want
to have sexual intercourse with their mothers,"" busily write it down,
and wait for the next point. Having missed the last one.)
Not that I think I've convinced anyone of anything, but let's get on
to rudeness. Really not getting on at all, since the same point
raised above -- that attention may be better commanded by striking
the listener in the face with a dead fish than by writing a deadly
boring essay such as I am now doing -- applies here. Maybe you
should regard Arndt as an onion in the stew of life, and not expect
your reasoned arguments to turn him into a carrot.
The suggestion has been tendered that someone, not Ken, who reads
an Arndt message and espies some redeeming quality there, translate
the message for the edification of the remainder of the crew. A bad
idea, I think, but since I am filled (indeed, brimming over) with
polite language (rather gray, but it doesn't disturb anyone as long
as I don't mention National Review), let me try an example. Ken
recently wrote in an article that when in boot camp he felt sorry
for a crying recruit who was kicked by every other recruit who passed
him, including, when Ken got to him, Ken. Some net.motss readers
read this as a brave ""coming out of the closet"" on Ken's part,
others as an expression of Ken's wimpiness/rudeness/brutality.
Enter Mr. Explain-it-in-all-gray-tones! Ahem. ""In the message from
Ken, which you are not reading because its style, nay, its very
language, was deemed inappropriate, Ken related an anecdote, or
perhaps a parable, to the effect that today's polite sympathy may not
translate into polite actions on the morrow."" Really grabbed you, eh?
Thought so.
(You know, as I was mentally composing this essay, I kept hearing
Muzak playing when I thought of the brave new world we all expect
when everyone talks and writes ever so politely, and reasonably,
like, say, me. I couldn't figure out why the damned Muzak was
playing for a couple of hours, when I suddenly was hit by the
shopping market scene at the end of ""Stepford Wives."" I'd explain
the scene in words, but I'm afraid I'd gray so far as to disappear.)
Listen, I suspect two things: That Ken is damned nigh well unique
(certainly on this net), and that the kind of person many net.motss
readers think he is, is not. It's the latter you've got to look
out for and try to sway. Run off to mod.motss if you will, where
the moderator will protect you from immoderate opinions -- but
if everything turns to shit, and the world comes tumbling down
on your head, please refrain from asking ""But they all seemed so
nice! What happened?""
I can sense that some of you (most of you?) are still unconvinced.
Very well, in better polite language than my own...
     ""Perhaps there is really no such thing as a Revolution
     recorded in history. What happened was always a Counter-
     Revolution. Men were always rebelling against the last
     rebels; or even repenting of the last rebellion. This
     could be seen in the most casual contemporary fashions,
     if the fashionable mind had not fallen into the habit of
     seeing the very latest rebel as rebelling against all
     ages at once. The Modern Girl [this written in 1933]
     with the lipstick and the cocktail is as much a rebel
     against the Women's Rights Woman of the '80's, with her
     stiff stick-up collars and strict teetotalism, as the
     latter was a rebel against the Early Victorian lady of the
     languid waltz tunes and the album full of quotations from
     Byron; or as the last, again, was a rebel against a
     Puritan mother to whom the waltz was a wild orgy and
     Byron the Bolshevist of his age. Trace even the Puritan
     mother back through history and she represents a rebellion
     against the Cavalier laxity of the English Church, which
     was at first a rebel against the Catholic civilisation,
     which had been a rebel against the Pagan civilisation.
     Nobody but a lunatic could pretend that these things
     were a progress; for they obviously go first one way and
     then the other.""

City, New York, pp. 76-77, 1956. Which is, of course, irrelevant
because it was written by (a) a conservative who (b) is dealing with
a religious topic.]
Of course, Ken may be simply as you see him: a rude and unintelligible
boor. Yes, Ken could be exactly what many of you think he is, a bad
boy so typical of the religious right. So typical.
Keep your eyes on him.

""unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", ""rude""?  Do you actually read
either Arndt's or anyone else's postings in net.motss?  (I'm get-
ting tired of asking this rather rhetorical question, but the
myopia on this net is just unbelievable!)
SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson 
are that they're bigoted, insulting, exhibitionistic in really loathsome
ways (like, for example, street psychotics), filled with hatred and
self-hatred, etc. etc.  And this adds up to merely ""rude""?  Is it
merely ""rude"" to call a group of blacks ""filthy niggers"" who ought
to be ""hung from the nearest available tree"" AND then launch into,
say, ""rational"" discussion of race relations and the legislative
agenda before Congress?  And then swerve into a polemic denouncing
funding for sickle cell anemia (""Let 'em die!  We'll finally have
social peace!""), and discourse repetitively & at great length about
the genetic disposition of black men to commit rape (of white women,
that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt
Phenomenon is that bigoted and deliberately offensive postings 
are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this
option at all.

public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

It looks for all the world like HLTVIII is the bug responsible for AIDS.
Its origins may be Nigeria (though the Kaposi's sarcoma stuff looks
similar, it's a symptom rather than a near relative) by way of the Carib.
Further, serum is the media that the little cyto-megalovirus lives in,'
but the transmission (read vector here) is *overwhelmingly* limited to
the seriously promiscous element of the gay community...with the exception
of those members of the popluation (usually hemophiliac) who cannot use
filtered blood, and those (usually bisexual) in direct contac with the
above mentioned.
What steps are being taken in the gay community to address the issue of
AIDS....control, spread, etc. I am personally inclined to view it in
much the same manner as any other venereally transmitted disease (save
for the obvious fact that gonorrhea isn't fatal, and doesn't have a similiar
etiology)...controlling the disease is a question of habit. To the extent
that the gay agenda for increased civil recognition *requires* a broad-based
coalition within the gay community, does the potential ""self-policing""
of the gay community represent a an internal threat to the coalition
necessary for gay rights?
If Phil Ngai and the spokesperson on NPR for the gay/lesbian coalition 
last night on the bathhouse closings are to be believed, the issue
*has* begun to move into the political and judicial spotlight. Must the
SF department of public health move to close the bathhouses because
the gay community has for some reason refused to close the places
themselves?

(Byron's reply)
Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny.  AIDS is serum-vectored
not 'homosexual vectored.' 
 
               ***(Ken now) 
             Wrong!!!  A vector is, ""an insect or other ORGANISM (italics
mine) transmitting germs or other agents of disease"" - Am Coll. Dict. 
The serum is merely the medium the virus is in, NOT the vector.  Or to put it
another way, the action (behavior) of the vector passes the virus, the serum is
neutral.  It is the behavior of the vector, in this case homosexuals which 
passes on the disease.  Such as anal intercourse, which often causes minute
tearing of the small blood vessels in the lower bowel and makes possible the
passing of the virus.  Also the passing of other serums (saliva, semen) 
transmits the virus.
************************
NOW HEAR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
************************
 
       I am NOT, that is NOT, saying that homosexuals are responsible for AIDS!
The virus is, of course!!  They are responsible (the promiscuous ones, remember
the same way promiscuous hetrosexuals are responsible for other sexually 
related diseases) for the TRANSMISSION of the disease virus!!!!!
If you, or anyone else, cares to remember I started this whole thing by saying
""smugly of course"" AIDS would be a hammar blow to drive the homosexuals back
into the closet and what are the gays doing about that.  The answer so soon
forthcoming, from Steve Dyer, et al, was ""EEk, get away from me, you rough
trade you.  How dare you even ASK such a question, etc., etc.""  They treated
me like a fart at a cheeze tasters ball.  I know, I know, I didn't say ""may
I"" and tell how much I think you all contribute to civilization and what
great guys and gals you all are otherwise.
 
I would have thought a reasonable response would have been, ""yes we have a
problem and here is what we are doing about it . . . ie. speaking out against
bath house sex as unhealthy if not psychologically, then from a physical
standpoint.  Remember gang, it's not just AIDS out there haunting the gay
community!  There are a raft of nasties of which the gay community is the
vector.
 
   (Byron answers previous posting)                                            
The first identifiable breakout just happens
to have been in the gay population.  It could have as easily been among
drug addicts, pro football players or army privates.  The first instances
of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century.  That
doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it.  Was the American
Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?
        *****(Ken replies now)
           Well, it actually started in Africa and the Carib. but yes in the
U.S.of A. it ""came out"" in the gay community.  Again, I agree with you that
the gays are not responsible for the virus!!!  But they ARE, that's ARE, 
responsible for continuing to be the vector once it became known HOW the
virus was passed!!  To take measures (filter blood supply, avoid contact, etc)
against the vector is a reasonable thing to do.  And homosexuals themselves
are taking steps to guard against getting the disease.
**************
Note:  No one is taking steps against the serum!!  Wiping out spit, semen, 
blood.  Isn't that because the serum is not the vector????  What IS being
done, or at least ought to be done, is to take steps against the vector.
Bath houses ARE being closed.  Often on the request of homosexual groups!

>What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious

(old Byron)
It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place
blame.  That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it
certainly doesn't protect either of us.  Do you have anything constructive
to offer?  If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments.
       ****(new Ken now)
              You muddle-headed shit-head!  Promiscuous homosexuals ARE to
""blame"" for passing on the virus!!!  And now the more so since they KNOW
they are the vector.  But that is NOT the point of my postings.  You, and
your clones, -: appear to me to be like a little child caught at something
or other.  Trying to point to anything else but themselves. The point of all
my postings was, and is, to get responses from the gay community as to how
they plan to deal with the very real dangers that confront them.  Lucky for
you all gays are not like the few on this net who can't seem to deal with
me.  There isn't anyone who says that the homosexual community isn't the
vector for these diseases!!!!!  That's no news.  That's not the point of
any of my postings.
I see a tidal wave of events shaping up before the gay community that will
wipe them out!!!!  You mumble and press the ""n"" key.  Great!  Maybe the
Smithsonian will be able to preserve a few of you in pickle jars.
[By the way, I have been toying with a piece on the impact of ""modern"" ethics
as seen in statements by bioethicists on abortion, on the homosexual community.
That is, if gays are ever seen as a ""diseased"" danger, a quality of life issue,  
or a threat to the majority's value system if that value system doesn't include
any idea of the value of the individual. Do the new ""ethics"" set the stage
for sending the gays to the ""showers""?]        
(old Ken) 
>You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise

 (old Byron)
So what are YOU going to do about it?  If AIDS is in the general population
then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility.  What
are you trying to do?  From the tone and content of your postings all I
can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back!  The smugness
that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune.
I got news for you.  Viruses mutate.  It's what they do.  That's how
the disease got here in the first place according to some.  Should
this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble
and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us 
out of that trouble.
      ************(Ken now)
       I told YOU they mutate.  And yes some feel that's where this outbreak
came from.  It's only a half-brainer to figure out what we'll do if it gets
into the general public.  PANIC!!!!  And look for SCAPEGOATS!!  And isolate
them!!!  Guess who?  
It is partly because of my concern for myself that I have raised the issue
with you.  I am potentially at risk.  Because of YOU (or your promiscuous 
fellows).  
What am I doing???  Well, for starters I've given you all more information
than you've ever seen on this net. I've gone to the vector and asked for
a plan of action.  Some of you ARE in homosexual organizations.  It doesn't
appear that you know of any action to stop the disease.  Just treat it.
I'm asking you to take it back??  Cute but stupid.  Not to mention a lie.
Smug?!  Is that your best answer??  Sad.
 
What am I doing??? See below in the very next section.  Aren't I asking you
to take some action.  Tell me, to the best of your memory, has anyone on the
net said perhaps the gays should relook at their ""lifestyles"" even if only 
during the present health crisis?  Maybe one or two touched on it, but most
(like you) just stood on a chair and pulled up their skirts.

 (old Byron)
Isn't this all a little like locking the barn door after the horses have
escaped?  I went through the sexual revolution and never even caught cold.
My experience doesn't mean a d*mn thing either.  We agree that AIDS is
a tragedy, now WHAT ARE YOU AND I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
             ******(new Ken)
        Looking at it as locking the barn door is just plain stupid - and
dangerous for the gays.  Changing promiscuous behavior NOW could provent
a lot of cases of AIDS.
 
Yes, by all means, let's get together and come up with ""what you and I are
going to do about it.""

That's why I'm  bothering to reply to you.  Dumping the freaks before they
drag me down with them.  I got little use for someone who sits in corners
and rants and raves, gleefully pointing out victims with a singular lack
of compassion, but hasn't the desire to do something constructive.
            **********(new Ken)
         Come on Byron.  Sure I'm not Mr. Congeniality, but ""gleefully

but that's another story!
 
You don't seem to know any more about AIDS, etc. than you do about biblical
texts.  What are you doing in net.religion?  I know, you have a terminal.

Glad you said that my statement to the effect that Aids is ""homosexually
vectored"" is SOMEWHAT imprecise!  Because it's not imprecise by much if
at all.  ""Intermingling of blood"", yes but not from bumping into each other,
unless . . . (but I'm trying to change).  It's not the fact of transfusions
(the act) that causes Aids!  I get Aids from a carrier who donated blood.
The carriers are identified as . . . (fill in the blanks).  You seem to be
saying pouring blood causes Aids!  ""Aids is transmitted through the inter-
mingling of blood supply as might happen with transfusion.""
By the way, Aids is also transmitted through semen and some feel through
saliva.
What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious

Where do you read my ""smug assurance"" of my own safety??
I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children
with Aids.  About 70 so far, with hundreds more projected.  They highlighted
the problems of one little boy under sentence of death (are you SURE that
homosexuals are not responsible just a little - even those not promiscuous
but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
Hey, it's getting bigger by the minute.  You've got to do more than raise
funds, teach each other to check for sores first and man hotlines.  Hint:
You've got to speak to fellow gays about behavior patterns (which might
entail relooking at ""lifestyles"" ((baths, bars, etc.))).
How about looking at the ""sexual revolution""?  Remember the young Aids

Another, Gerber, asks ""am I my brother (homosexual's) keeper?""  What a waste-
land if the answer to that is no!!
As Aids and it's cost get bigger the public is going to look for SCAPEGOATS!
Guess who?  Think all those nice pols are going to help you then?
So rather than marching with Sister Boom Boom and the Children's Crusade
you should be marching the other way!  Dump the freaks before they drag -:

approve of Mr. Ardnt.
From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct 10, 1984.
In a prepared statement on Tuesday, San Francisco public health director
Mervyn Silveman said ""These businesses (gay bathhouses) have been
inspected on a number of occasions and demonstrate a blatant disregard for
the health of their patrons and of the community.
	""Make no mistake about it. These 14 establishments are not
fostering gay liberation. They are fostering disease and death.""
	He then ordered the commercial sex establishments closed.
Silverman had threatened to close the bathhouses and other commercial
sex establishments last March, but instead ordered a ban on sex in such
establishments in the city. Silverman said his decision (to close the
bathhouses) was reached because ""we now have solid evidence that AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease - often spread by people who are unaware that
they are carrying the virus. The virus, he said, has been found in 40 to 50
percent of the gay male population in San Francisco.

Who does it hurt, Ken?  It doesn't hurt ME.  What laws?  (Or, to
rephrase that, what ENFORCED laws). Sexual acts between two consenting
adults are not exactly investigated by the police anymore.   
      Ken->    **No, no Andy, I only meant those to be examples of criteria,
                 I was not trying to say they are the ones to be chosen!  That
                 would be up to any homosexual who wished to answer me.  Either
                 I didn't make that clear or you misconceived (an oxymoron??)
                 my statement.  But since you ask . . .:
                    Doesn't hurt you, eh?  As long as you don't get AIDS (which
                    we all understand doesn't have ANYTHING to do with 
                    homosexual behavior and practice, or any other cute little
                    disease) or you are not phychologically damaged (as any
                    heterosexual - see Perlow?) by promiscuity.  And no need
                    for you hurt yourself by missing out on a family with 
                    children - you can always adopt (with a little change to 
                    the laws - like ERA).  And never to know that one woman
                    who above all others fills your life as a woman, to 
                    stand beside her as she gives birth to your child -
                    Doesn't hurt you?  YOU LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE!!
 
                    Some laws against homosexuals ARE being enforced (in the
                    armed forces, - try waving it around in the park as a sign
                    of ""affection"" in the heartland or here in New Hampster
                    and see if the laws are being enforced).
                    And of course we know that things are not going to revert
                    to the bad old days in the closet, right?  Wrong bozo.
                    See below.
 
 
Who sets these accepted values Ken?  You? I sure hope not.  I am
accepted by most people I know.. people I live with, work with, am
friends with, my parents, the rest of my family.  Let's face it, even
with people like you out there, homosexuality is becoming more accepted
around the country.
 
               **  It is not a case of you or I waking up one morning
                   and setting values.  They are ALREADY SET and the
                   homosexual rights movement is trying to change them.
                   That's their whole point - the values are there.
                   I'm reminded of the first Russian soldiers into Berlin.
                   They were very well behaved towards the civilians.  Just
                   interested in killing German soldiers.  But one of them
                   is quoted as saying, ""Look out for those who come behind
                   us.  They are pigs.""  He was right.  And my point here is
                   that you might be a lot better off than you think if I DID
                   set the values.  I'm not for putting you all in jail - yet!
                   You know how some other countries treat homosexuals - and 
                   don't think it couldn't happen here!!!  I admit though,
                   even I have limits:
                       A sea story-> (oh goody) To illustrate my limits.
                       I remember being in a long line in boot camp, short
                       arm inspection or something, and there was this guy
                       on the floor in the hall who couldn't take the whole
                       boot camp bit and was crying.  I felt so bad I wanted
                       to step out of line and comfort him.  Some of the other
                       guys were kicking him as they went by.  By the time I
                       came abreast of him I had decided to kick him too.  So
                       I did!  It's great to be part of a tradition!!
                       Now the point of that little sea story, in case you
                       missed it, is that there are values and there are values.
                       People may give lip service to the idea of homosexual
                       rights but if the lid comes off the homosexual health
                       crisis (seen the T.V. adds about hepatitis?  call this
                       800 # ""to find out if you are in the high risk group""
                       Gee Martha, what group is that?, they're starting to
                       ask in East Overshoe) or too many more stories like
                       the one about the little eight year old girl in Texas
                       a few nights ago (with her mother crying on the couch
                       ""I just want to hold her again and tell her I love her"")
                       who appears to have been taken by a pervert make the 
                       nightly news we may, indeed I say we will, see a DEMAND
                       to ""clean up"".  I quote the sheriff in the town where
                       the little girl was taken, ""If the courts can't protect
                       us, we'll do it ourselves"".  This guy had been let out
                       after several sex offenses.  Of course the mob is going
                       to stop and say, ""No wait, they're only a couple of nice
                       gay boys who don't have anything to do with this.""                                                                    
 
                As for your statement that homosexual behavior is becoming more
                accepted, why there is evidence that that is just not so, even
                with the new T.V. shows. We are just now entering into the time
                when the baby boomers are coming of age and THEY are the ones
                who will be setting the values over the next quarter century!
                Guess what?  They are more conservative than their parents!
                Read the poles.  They are by a huge majority for Reagan and
                his values.  You do know where he stands on the moral issue
                don't you?  But let me quote from a pro homosexual source:
                    1978 poll showed 70% of Americans believed that homosexual
                    acts always wrong even if the people are in love.
                   ""Typically Americans feel that homosexuals can be eliminated
                    by concerted social action.""                                                     
 
                   1979 poll of entering UCLA freshmen 39%females,56%males said
                   ""homosexual relations should be prohibited""
                   1977 Gallop poll listed 56% of Americans as saying 
                   homosexuality was due to upbringing or environment.
 
                   (All the above taken from GAYSPEAK:GAY MALE AND LESBIAN
                    COMMUNICATION, Pilgrim Press, N.Y.,1981, pg.ix.)
                    This book, which is well worth looking at, deals with
                    what and who are homosexuals.  Ok so the polls may be
                    dated.  But ask yourself, has the country gotten more or
                    less conservative since then?  Has there been a move back
                    to ""traditional values""?  When is the last time before
                    just now that you saw a liberal democrat hectored by
                    people over traditional values?  Who is Jerry Falwell
                    and why is he able to register the same number or more
                    voters as the Rev. JJ in the south? - he's doing it
                    in all 50 states (ABC news)?   
 
And in reference to the statement 'is MOTSS a microcosm of society', the
definite answer is NO!  Society in general does not use UNIX, does not
post messages to the UUCP net.  And until they do, we have to realize
that we are dealing with a subgroup of humanity, a very select subgroup,
with probably the same amount of homosexuals as the rest of society, but
not your 'average homosexualty'.
               ** don't recognize my making this statement.
And in reference to pedophelia, it DOES NOT BELONG HERE!  Pedophelia is
not limited to gays AT ALL, why stick it  on us.  Sure, it's a problem
but in the same way murder is a problem around society, it's not a
specifically GAY problem.
                ** Keep saying that, . . . as the mob puts the rope around
                   your chicken neck.  Besides I'm only calling you on the
                   part that IS your problem - the gays who ARE pedophelia
                   prone.  But I feel I've answered this in my replies to
                   Richard Johnson and Steve Dyer.
Also, I though you were going, Ken.  Why don't you just do what you said
you were going to do, or admit you like being able to make people mad at
you who you will never see.  I really don't care especially, but I worry
about those people who read motss and never post anything, because I
know that the general consensus is that you are a feeb, and really
should be ignored.
 
              ** Sorry to be such a tease.  And an upset.  I really don't 
                 want to know what the general consensus is (is feeb).
                 I want to know what is right.  Listen Andy, if I'm so wrong,
                 why are you guys so mad?  Like you say just ignore an idiot.
                 I do.  You people are not idiots in my book, just mistaken.
                 But you are close, gang.  I mean have you really read some
                 of the silly statements I've had thrown at me?
 
 
                 I just know you'll wake up tomorrow morning and say I was
                 right and go out and grab a woman.  (If you get stuck on
                 what to do after you grab call me.)

Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny.  AIDS is serum-vectored
not 'homosexual vectored.'  Among the other ailments that are carried
this way are certain forms of hepatitis, mononucleosis, and a large variety
of more common infections.  The first identifiable breakout just happens
to have been in the gay population.  It could have as easily been among
drug addicts, pro football players or army privates.  The first instances
of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century.  That
doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it.  Was the American
Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?
>What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious
>problem to the entire population . . . "" mean??  The point of my postings
>was that very fact!!!
It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place
blame.  That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it
certainly doesn't protect either of us.  Do you have anything constructive
to offer?  If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments.
>I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
>your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
 
Just 'cause your mommy makes you go to bed right after 'The A-Team'
doesn't mean the rest of us work that way, Kenny.
>Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
 
>You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
>there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children

>but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
>out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
>Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
 
So what are YOU going to do about it?  If AIDS is in the general population
then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility.  What
are you trying to do?  From the tone and content of your postings all I
can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back!  The smugness
that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune.
I got news for you.  Viruses mutate.  It's what they do.  That's how
the disease got here in the first place according to some.  Should
this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble
and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us 
out of that trouble.

>Another, Gerber, asks ""am I my brother (homosexual's) keeper?""  What a waste-

Isn't this all a little like locking the barn door after the horses have
escaped?  I went through the sexual revolution and never even caught cold.
My experience doesn't mean a d*mn thing either.  We agree that AIDS is
a tragedy, now WHAT ARE YOU AND I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
>As Aids and it's cost get bigger the public is going to look for SCAPEGOATS!

>you down with them.  Of course by dump them I mean their positions.
 
That's why I'm  bothering to reply to you.  Dumping the freaks before they
drag me down with them.  I got little use for someone who sits in corners
and rants and raves, gleefully pointing out victims with a singular lack
of compassion, but hasn't the desire to do something constructive.
>Hey, guess what.  There goes the last of the wine and I'm leaning over too

So maybe you're not LEAPING!
Maybe not even SCREAMING!
 
I have been called a lot worse.  And sometimes it was true. And sometimes not.
My mention of missing out on the joys (and heartaches) of knowing a woman
was an attempt to raise the issue of what is ""natural"".  (Boswell too easily
discounts the argument Christians make that homosexuality is ""unnatural"".)
But that's another debate.  (In preparation, see C.S. Lewis's book STUDIES
IN WORDS, Cambridge U. Pr.,1967, NATURE, pp.24-74)
 
I don't care if you call me a LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE,  it could become a
term of endearment!  I think you are reaching, to get me to believe that you
were personally offended.  By the way, don't say things like, ""If I was female""
it could give you ideas or something.  See, I care about you.
You sound to me like a Christian reading the laws of perfection when you start
quoting the rules to me.  Hey, you don't really think I'm that bad, do you?
I mean I may toss a bladder at you but I don't hate you or anything.  The time
I said I hate you all (homosexuals) it was (so I thought) so obviously a
facetious remark (remember, I added that it must be so because I was question-
ing your beliefs) that it couldn't be misunderstood.  Wrong!  Someone pointed
it up as 'proof' I was hate filled.
I have never even intimated that I thought homosexuals were not human.
""Never forget that the person on the other side is Human""  In fact, I 
specifically stated to Steve Dyer I didn't even think you were idiots, 
just mistaken!
 
What's wrong with your SO ""filling your life""?  Sure it's a big job!
Are you really not your brother's keeper?  How do you know it's a minority 
that have bathroom sex?  What studies gave you that data?  Just a hunch huh?
I SAID  I was not ""painting all homosexuals with the same brush"" (when I
was talking about child abuse - but the same goes for promiscuity).  Haven't
I made that plain enough?  Of course to Steve Dyer every remark like that I
make is gratuitous.  Who's paranoid now?
I don't think all homosexuals are the same.  That's not my idea of equality.
 
Oh dear.  Bozo!  The forbidden word.  Now THAT'S rude!
What the hell is my 'military defense'?  Tell me so I'll know.  I never said
there were no homosexuals in the military!  Is that what you meant? Of course
gays in service serve their country well.
This season's T.V. shows (for the masses) have more homosexuals in them.
(Norman Lear is really in the pay of Jerry Falwell - getting the masses
to face the question of where homosexals fit in - or out - wanna put it
to a vote by the public?)
No I don't enjoy making people suffer more.  But someone's got to do it!
[Facetious, facetious!)
How do you know Andy doesn't have a chicken neck???  Is that your idea of
""REALLY RUDE""?  Where have you been hanging out?  Not with the big boys.
Again with the ""not my business"" stuff.  Yes Yes Yes the men who rape little
girls (or anyone) are my business.  I make it my business!
Oh boy!  MY MOB'S BIGGER THAN YOUR MOB!  Besides I'm not so stupid as to be
leading the mob.  And I don't need a mob:
                I have . . ahem . . RIGHT on my side!  -:
Gays get WOMEN (girls? boy are you showing your hang-ups - sic'em NOW)
who don't (as a general statement - I can make'em too) want sexual
attachments with men.  I mean gay men, not bisexuals.
Misinformed?  Show me.
Reactionary?  Sure, like someone who defends what's good against change for
the worse.
Slightly insane?  Now if you can tell what is sane in this world we'd all
like to know.
Interesting.  Why thank you.  I find all the people on this net interesting.
As people.  Even though I disagree with some of them.  That's just part of
what makes them interesting.  I even find it interesting that they take
offense so easily.  (I think it says something about them, I mean about
what they believe or believe they believe)
 
I once had a homosexual boss.  Great guy.  Caught hepatitus finally.  One
day I told him his eyes looked yellow and he freaked out.  I had to drive
him to the hospital.  Was he pissed at his SO!  Was I glad I never ate his
sandwich!
I knew a guy who otherwise was normal as rain.  But his goal was to be
EATEN.  I mean cooked and eaten!!!  He's in someone's septic system by
now.  Claimed he knew people in N.Y. who would do it for him.  At first
I thought he was putting me on, but after a few months I believed him.
So see, you guys aren't so strange or fearful to me as some of you have
wondered.
Be glad to meet you for a glass of beer sometime.  (You keep your glass
and I'll keep mine! -: -:)  I looked for you on ELF but you are either
very new at DEC or you didn't really mean you work at DEC.
Oh well, here comes another truck into the loading dock so I have to get
back to work.
Stay tight and look to your right,

on our national health system.
Dr. John Dwyer of Yale-New Haven Hospital calls it ""the disease of the
century in every respect"" - including financial.
Roger McFarland, head of the Gay Men's Health Crisis committee in NYC,
says, ""AIDS is a human tragedy and a financial nightmare that no one is
facing up to.""
George Seage, epidemiologist for the city of Boston says, ""We have an
epidemic not only of AIDS cases but of AIDS costs.  We're talking about
an incredible cost epidemic that's going to put a strain on the medical
system.""
[Of course this is just data that fits my view, right??  We all know, as
some on the net have pointed out, that data is only a propaganda tool
especially when it doesn't ""fit"".]
The above quotes are from today's Boston Globe.
The article also points out the call for regional centers to deal with
AIDS patients as our hospitals are being swamped.  AIDS victims require
much extra care (separate food handling, laundry, etc.) and the costs are
such (100K + per) that it is a strain on current funding (Soc. Sec., Medicaid,
CDC research funding, etc.).  One Billion $ this year and two Billion projected
for 1985!  Care costs that is.
Congress and Margret Heckler are baulking at providing more funding!!  Not
because they hate homosexuals, but because there is just not enough money
to go around.  As I pointed out before, research $ are being taken now from
other projects at CDC (such as the current epidemic of rabies moving up the
East Coast) to fund AIDS research.  But research funding is only a small part
of the money needed for the AIDS epidemic!  Hospital support costs are the
major ones as stated above.
Some sad, sad facts.  Boston is now in the early stages of it's AIDS epidemic!
(Do you know who your SO has been with during the last four years??)
Typically there has been 18 months between diagnosis and death in AIDS cases.
What kinds of public pressure are going to surface when the cost to society of
this homosexually vectored disease become more apparent?
 
Anyone on the net care to make a guess?  Opps!  I forgot.  No one will
answer because of my past postings!
Again, health and child abuse issues ARE impacting the perspective the public
has of the homosexual community and it's drive for ""rights"".  Too bad I have
made it impossible to speak to these issues on motss.  On top of that I have
driven netters away and silenced any other topics.  The power of the Lymph
node!  Sure!

other things has prevented me from even looking at net.motss.  I got back so
late, I have missed all of the responses (UCLA dumps them after a month, I
think).  Now I'm back for several months.
In Los Angeles, the political diversity is extreme and many organizations are 
quite active.  I'll try to encapsulate some information about the ones I'm 
familiar with:
CHRISTOPHER STREET WEST
This organization puts on the annual Christopher Street West parade and
festival in July.  The organizers are mainly representatives of the gay bar 
owners and gay-oriented shopkeepers in West Hollywood, and the parade and
festival take on the expected air.  The parade is filled with floats from
different gay bars, dating services, and so forth.  Political groups and
activity-oriented groups are very poorly represented in both the parade and the
festival.  This is partially due to the high price tag of participation, and
perhaps partially due to the biases of the organizers.
The CSW board of directors is quite inbred.  While most community groups
are run by the people that attend meetings regularly, in order to serve on the
CSW board you must be elected by the board itself.  The process involved in
getting on the board takes approximately one year of meeting attendence, plus
making lots of friends on the board.  Once you have been elected to the board,
you can be booted off by an election of the board (and this has been done a
number of times).  A leading member of CSW, George Piazzi, seems to be
extremely conservative.  He is running for a position on the West Hollywood
city council.
There was almost nothing oriented toward gay rights in this year's parade and
festival.  The reason, unfortunately, is quite apparent.
SUNSET JUNCTION STREET FAIR
In sharp contrast to CSW, the people who organize the Sunset Junction Street
Fair (held in late August) are very community-oriented.  Situated in the Silver
Lake area of Los Angeles, Sunset Junction attempts to bring in all segments of
the community.  Silver Lake is populated by gays, latins, and a few orientals.
Sunset Junction incorporates all these elements, with music, food, and
entertainment from each.
There were many political groups represented at Sunset Junction, including
Gay/Lesbian Latinos Unidos, Log Cabin Club, Harvey Milk, ad nauseum.  The theme
seems to be diversity.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how the organization functions.  Probably more
egalitarianly than CSW.
GAY/LESBIAN LATINOS UNIDOS
This group has a number of community-oriented events during the year.  The one
I attended most recently was their annual dinner/dance, where they install
their new officers (elected by vote of members).  It was quite fun.  The food
was excellent and spicy.  I got to sit across the table from Steve Schulte and
his lover, who both appear on the front cover of the late September Advocate.
Steve Schulte is running for West Hollywood city council, and will probably be
the mayor.  He is also an ex-Colt model (politics makes strange bedfellows).
GLLU also has participated in several political events, including the
SurvivalFest held August 5th in central Los Angeles.  They seem to be quite
left-wing, sporting such slogans as ""CIA out of Nicaragua,"" and the like.
GLLU, as far as I know, is a fairly new group, but its membership has grown
rapidly.  I don't know much more about it.
GAY AND LESBIAN ASSOCIATION (GALA)
GALA is the local campus (UCLA) organization.  Its primary purpose, as with
most campus organizations, is to assist in the process of ""coming out.""  Thus,
GALA activities tend to be social, rather than political.  They have regular
""rap sessions,"" regular meetings with speakers on different aspects of gay life
(from AIDS to the Gay Archives), and occasional ""quasi-political"" events.
One such event was the Western Region Gay and Lesbian Conference, held at UCLA.
This drew people from the UC campuses, as well as political heavies from
Sacramento (California's capitol city).
In addition, they organized a letter-writing campaign for AB-1 (California's
gay rights bill).  Because they are a special interest group on campus, with a
big campus budget and an office, they are generally prohibited from doing
anything visibly political, like rallies.
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
There is nothing (political or social) going on here, as far as I know.
Strange, since I know several gays on campus there.  I think the administration
might be homophobic.
SUMMARY
This has been kind of sketchy, but perhaps it gives you a flavor of the kinds
of activities in Los Angeles.  There are several groups I didn't describe,
mostly because I know very little about them.  These include: the Gay and
Lesbian Community Services Center, Harvey Milk Gay Democratic Club, the
Stonewall Democratic Club, the Log Cabin Club (a group of very confused
gays ... they are Republicans), Great Outdoors (a hiking group).

Every so often biblical passages purporting to censure gay sexuality get
posted to the net by presumably devout netters, perhaps as a kind of
public service to the unrighteous.  I imagine a poster thinking, ""This
will silence both silly religious liberals who seem incapable of recalling 
what the Bible actually says AND irreligious homosexual publicists who sim-
ply cannot tolerate the idea that there is at least one tradition/institu-
tion/faith that makes no ""allowance"" for homosexuality, no matter what de-
gree of accomodation secular institutions and attitudes are willing to make
for ""gays"".""  I then imagine a warm proprietary glow enveloping the poster,
mixed with a renewed disdain for the spinelessness of worldly ethics; phrases
like ""our Bible"" float subliminally in his mind; finally, a weary sigh escapes
his lips: though virtue is its own reward, those who will bear witness to the 
truth are doomed to repeat themselves in the company of the insensate (most
netters) -- how many times before has he quoted holy writ to these helium
heads? 
As a vehicle for rebutting those who cite scripture, I'm using Don Caprio's
recently posted list of biblical passages traditionally used to justify
Christian homophobia, followed by summaries of John Boswell's explications
of these passages.  Lines from Mr. Caprio's message begin with an angle
bracket.  I've added a few more passages he didn't include.
Numbers in curly brackets refer to page numbers in Boswell's book CHRIS-
TIANITY, SOCIAL TOLERANCE, & HOMOSEXUALITY (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1981,
$9.95 in paperback).  All errors of fact or interpretation are mine.

> Here are some biblical references for the homosexuality [read ""homophobia""]
> issue:
""Some""?  In fact, these are most of the biblical passages construed as expres-
sing disapproval of gay sexuality, and, except for the Sodom story, the ones
most important for making the homophobic case.  Moreover, the entry below from 
Leviticus is ""the only place in the OT where homosexual acts per se are men-
tioned"" {100}.  The Sodom & Gomorrah episode does not mention or even likely
imply homosexuality.  The trend in scholarship since 1955 is to view it as a
fable about (violation of) hospitality, not sexuality. Boswell points out that
the homosexual interpretation is ""relatively recent"" and that no OT references
to the episode so interpret it. {92-99}
>    ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female;

>			      Leviticus 20:13  (NASB)
""Abomination"" & ""detestable act"" are both translations of the Hebrew word
TOEVAH meaning ""something which is ritually unclean for Jews"" {100}, but
not usually something ""intrinsically evil"" {100-103}.  Eating pork or
having sex during menstruation is also ""toevah"".  Throughout the OT it
designates ""those Jewish sins involving ethnic contamination or idolatry""
{100}, often as the stock phrase ""toevah ha-goyim"", ""the uncleanness
of the gentiles"" {100}.
""Toevah"" often means ""idol"" {100}.  The first passage above immediately 
follows a prohibition of idolatrous & orgiastic religious rites:
	And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
	to Moloch.
			      Leviticus 18:21 (KJV)
The openings and purposes of both chapters, 18 & 20, are similar: to
provide guidelines to distinguish Jews from the pagans they lived among.
Chapter 20 details how ""ritual cleanliness"" is kept, and the beginning
of chapter 18 includes:
	After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
	ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
	I shall bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in
	their ordinances....
			      Leviticus 18:3 (KJV)
Although both chapters include prohibitions (eg., against incest and
adultery) of acts that are instrinsically wrong, Maimonides & other 
Jewish commentators agree that their mention here concerns ""their
function....as symbols of Jewish distinctiveness"" {101}.  By contrast,
recall that homosexual acts are mentioned nowhere else in the OT.
Even more to the point, Greek Bible texts, which along with the Vulgate
(Jerome's authoritative Latin translation, made from Greek texts) were
the versions of scripture used in Orthodoxy & Catholicism, sort ""toevah"" 
into two Greek terms, ANOMIA (violations of law or justice) & BDELYGMA 
(""infringements of ritual purity or monotheistic worship""), and use the
latter to characterize ""abomination"" and ""detestable act"", thus clearly
indicating that Christian translators & editors believed that ritual
purity and not morality was at stake.
In addition, the OT counted for little as a source for a detailed moral
code in the early (& even later) church.  Christ's ""new dispensation""
annulling the ""old law"" was taken seriously.  Also, by the 2nd century,
most Christian converts weren't Jewish, and belonged to cultures many
of whose most widespread customs were ""toevah"", such as eating pork &
shellfish & bloody meat, cutting beard & hair, clothing oneself in more
than one type of fabric at a time, practicing hybridization, etc.
In fact, Mosaic Law was felt to be so burdensome that as early as circa
49 AD, the Council of Jerusalem decided only four OT prohibitions bound
gentile Christians, namely to
	abstain from idol offerings & from blood & from what is stran-
	gled & from immorality.
			      Acts 21:25 (C - the Confraternity Edition)
Some have used this passage homophobically: but neither ""idol offerings""
(""pollutions of idols"" in KJV), referring to the eating of food offered
to idols, nor ""immorality"" (""fornication"" in KJV) refer to homosexuality.
""Fornication"", Latin ""fornicatio"", a precise term in moral theology,
from Greek ""porneia"", is nearly always distinguished from homosexuality.
In fact, the Latin term referred exclusively to heterosexual acts.  And
while ""porneia"" is somewhat ambiguous in Greek, ""it is clearly distinct
from 'bdelygma'"" {103}, under which Leviticus categorizes homosexual acts.
To sum up, the Levitical prohibition of homosexual acts is NOT tantamount
to a condemnation of them as inherently wrong.  And by the second century
AD, it was largely irrelevant to the mass of Christian converts.
[For Boswell on Leviticus & Acts, see pages 100-106.  Appendix 1, ""Lexico-
graphy & Saint Paul"", 335-353, analyzes in detail key terms in NT passages
alleged to condemn homosexual persons or acts.]

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the
above advice.  With a friend like you....(1/2 smiley face here)

Sour grapes here?  You should abstain from telling people to abstain
& continue the discussion so you can read my posting in the near fu-
ture about biblical texts (another 1/2 smiley face!).

With all this talk about ""hey, he had some valid points"",
Let's not get too awed by Arndt's insightfulness.  Taking all
that timely and useful info on AIDS as completely true, clearly
a guy who can use the word ""teleology"" in a sentence correctly
should be able to distinguish some behaviors of some homosexuals
from the essence of homosexuality.  The fact that the causes
of AIDS and homosexuality are both unknown does not make them
equivalent.  Can you pronounce the word ""spurious"", Ken?  Good.
Watch the spelling though--only one ""r"".
Yet, when you cut through Arndt's homopobia, ad hominems, and wet dreams
over Sophie Quigley's breasts, what's left is a surprisingly altruistic
plea.  Let me see if I can state it so you don't feel like putting your
fist through the screen:
Lots of casual sex, by members of any sex, is an epidemiologist's
nightmare.  Yes, ""even Pekingeses in the Ritz do it"", but whirlwind sex
is perceived as the alpha and omega of gays' existence by the ever
growing right wing.  (I take Ken's word for that, too.)  So, gays
are going to get blamed for all sorts of bad things, and it will get
worse as the diseases get worse and/or gays get more visible.  You
don't think so?  There's more of a link between gays and AIDS than
there was between Jews and Germany's post-WWI economy.  All it takes
is a little despair.  Add a tablespoon of political crisis and one
demagogue.  Shake well.  The people needs a scapegoat.  Always has.
So, Ken seems to be worried that the message of ""gay pride"" hasn't
been focused well enough to reassure him and his friends that the pride
has to do with the OK-ness of homosexuality, not casual sex.  AIDS is
very scary, and if it becomes salient in the straight community, a lot
of fear-crazed people may come looking for a very easy answer.  Ken
would rather not be muttering ""I told you so"" as he hides you from a
lynch mob or its all-nice-and-legal-like, first-we-try-'em-then-we-
hang-'em equivalent.
There is an urgency in Arndt's (and other homophobes') postings that
needs to be addressed.  Homosexuality is *threatening* to these
people, and they'll fight it.  What can be done?

I don't mind him though.  (Never you mind.)
But all that stuff about the lower intestinal tract, and bowels, and . . .
Uh, all that stuff.
Excuse me, but, what has that really got to do with being gay?
Being gay doesn't mean you have a desire to engage in certain acts.
Being gay means you like cuddling with other guys.  That you really
enjoy their company.  Aren't there straights that engage in the acts
Arndt described?  I could swear I've read about stuff like that in
Penthouse's FORUM.  (I didn't get it, my mother did.  She gave a copy
to me and two college buddies to read on a long ferry ride.  She only
got it because she wanted to see the Miss America stuff.)  Are they
[the straights described in FORUM who engage in anal sex] just as bad,
in Arndt's view?
Being gay is not about sex; it is about love and affection.
Or am I naive?
Mr. Arndt stirs my emotions.  It makes me defensive.  I certainly hope
I'm not a health risk.  I take precautions.  Mr. Arndt, why don't you
advocate that gays take care to insure that they minimize their chance
of getting AIDS?  I don't see where you get off knocking the Gay Men's
Health Crisis people.  If you're so concerned why don't you man one of
their hotlines?  Not your problem, huh.  Easier to criticize.
Everyone takes health risks.  The air quality is low today.  Can I have
a sip of your Pepsi?  Buckle up.  How do those new headphones sound?
Gee, that looks good.  55 saves lives.  Look both ways.  Should we change
the sheets?  Are you gonna finish that?  Don't sit so close to the TV.
Boy, did you get tanned.  Biological.  Physical.  Chemical.  God Bless You!
There are gay guys that choose to engage in activities which are currently
very risky.  Like anal sex with strangers.  These gay guys don't do things
like that because they are gay.  They do it because they are either stupid,
uninformed, or irresponsible.  Or maybe lost.  These things are unrelated to
being gay.  Being gay just has to do with whom you choose as your companion.
Also, Mr Arndt, attitudes like yours only make things worse.  How?  Well,
it goes like this.  Little Johnny is either going to be straight, or be gay.
There is no proven method for determining or setting this course.  There is
just nothing that has been shown to be effective in persuading Johnny about
whom he should choose for his companion.  BUT, you can have an effect on
how Johnny expresses his desires.  Attitudes like yours, Mr. Arndt, make
Johnny feel like a real worthless piece of shit.  If I were Johnny, and I
met you, I wouldn't feel so hot about myself.  So Johnny tries to go about
expressing his desires in ways that won't cause the people he loves to
suddenly hate him.  I'm not saying Mr. Arndt that YOU would disown your son
if you found out that he were gay.  It's just that, with the attitudes you
express, he would have good reason to believe that he might lose a little of
your affection for him.  You see, the persecution of gays is what causes
gays to do the things that the persecutors see as unfavorable.  If Johnny
knew deep down in his heart that you wouldn't have him any other way then
maybe he'd be proud to bring home the boy he met at the ice cream parlor.
To see if you approved of this boy.  To see how you felt about this boy
maybe becoming a part of the Arndt's extended family.  But no, Johnny
would never bring his ice cream parlor boy home to you Mr. Arndt.  In fact,
if you were Johnny's dad, Johnny would never be able to really love another
gay person because he would be filled with too much self-hatred.  Making
people hate themselves, and feel bad about themselves isn't good for anyone.
Mr. Arndt, you don't make me feel good about myself.  You don't make me feel
good about being gay.  Why do you enjoy being so mean, huh?  I'm sorry, I
just don't ever see the greatest good being serviced by hate.  You seem to
have a lot of hate Mr. Arndt.  You may not think so, but ask around.  Your
heart certainly is not filled with love when you talk about gays.  Ah, but
that's not your problem & it's easier to criticize.
If you want to go on making people feel real bad about themselves, then just
keep doing what you've been doing Mr. Arndt.  It won't drive ME into the
bushes searching for a little self-affirmation of my worth.  I know what
you're up to.  But I sympathize with Johnny who feels so ultimately unloved
that he would rather risk death than face constant isolation of the soul.
Mr. Arndt, it's not that I don't like hearing about AIDS.  In fact I do;
after all, I want to know what I can do to avoid getting it.  But I don't
like hearing about it from you.  I don't think anyone thinks your looking
out for them when you send out your warnings about AIDS.  They're not even
warnings, they're taunts.
I'm done now.  In the future I'll just 'n' over your articles unless I see
the word 'love' in the subject line.  You can use that as a cue to all us
net.motss'ers so we'll know when you've changed your tune.
Goodbye, Mr. Arndt.  It's been o.k. chatting with you.
I apologize to you for the public nature of this letter,
but my hope is that other people will benefit by reading it.
That's usually why I post articles.

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays. 
Important disclaimer from you is ""gay men"". Right, women don't fit

Ken Arndt starts an irrational argument along the following lines:  ""Defend
yourselves according to the way I have defined a valid moral position"".
Sorry, Mr. Arndt, but I'd rather debate the proposition:  ""Given that the
sky is red, prove that it's not red.""  Given the premise, both arguments
place me in an indefensible position, despite the fact that each has a
rather absurd premise.
On top of this, Arndt greets every reply with insult and ridicule.  Granted
he himself was greeted in several instances with insult and ridicule, but
ignored in the mess were any attempts that were made to point out to Arndt
just how biased and unreasonable his position is.  Arndt refuses to give
ground on his premises, accusses us of ""not having any answers,""
and ignores any that were presented in favor of baiting us further on the
issue.  Sorry again, Mr. Arndt, but your argument was well dealt with, but
if you're going to refuse to deal with the responses with a certain degree of
detachment, I suppose you won't really understand why.
Then along comes Plunkett, who accusses us merely of throwing temper tantrums,
dismisses us as a group as being defensive and petulant (among other equally
bizarre generalizations) and accusses us not merely of trying to find acceptance
but of proselytizing.  (Gee, {Mr, Ms} Plunkett, who asked for *your* phone
number?)  Then, of course, despite the fact that we shouldn't throw temper
tantrums, we must learn to put up with profanity from others.  Gosh, okay--
we'll be good and perfect and quietly take the abuse as it comes.
Now, I don't necessarily agree with Steve Dyer's suggestion concerning what
ought and ought not to be discussed in this newsgroup.  But the point comes
when discussion on this topic is no longer fruitful--and that point was
at least reached when the gay members of this group were required to argue
on the grounds of invalid premises if at all, or when attempts to explain
why homosexuality is valid are taken to be acts of proselytizing.  Providing
a forum where people might rationally discuss ideas is one thing; providing
a forum for name-calling is quite another.  I find it rather odd that the
people who pose questions in this group seem so unwilling to listen to the
answers.
As for questions, Plunkett poses one about public health.  Or so he says
that he does; actually he uses this as another attempt to vindicate his
viewpoint.  So I will address both:  AIDS (oh, my GOD--he said the word)
is not a consequence of being gay; if it were then it would strike lesbians
as well as gay men and it would not strike others who are not gay.  And as
an argument against homosexuality, at best it wins a temporary victory--
if that is why it's not ok to be gay, then being gay was okay before its
outbreak and will be again once it is able to be effectively treated.
Sorry, but I can't even grant it that; even though I'm gay I will probably
not contract AIDS but will probably die in an auto accident instead; I guess
that God must therefore hate the automobile because he uses it to draw so
many of us into the arms of Abraham.
There--a logical answer, without the hint of a temper tantrum.  Now I guess
I'll just have to wait and see if anyone can understand it.

blond hair?  It seemed to be something of a prerequisite . . .

 ITY, SOCIAL TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (U. Chicago Press, 1980) and
 professor (at a tender 37 years of age) of history at Yale.]

			PART TWO
        These four hypothetical criticisms may reflect an uneasy feeling 
readers have, which may be expressed as follows: ""Isn't Boswell merely
putting the best face on a (very) bad picture?  Isn't the book so much
whistling in the dark?""  Boswell thinks these qualms arise from a mis-
understanding of the relation between religion and ""eros"" (erotic or
romantic love, either heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, as opposed
sex subordinated to familial interests).  The particular situation of
the modern West, a secular culture in which sex sells ideas as well as
material goods, has affected even the perceptions of historians (even
today societies differ widely: Iran, Zambia, & the USSR are decidedly
nonerotic: media, literature, opinion & daily life reveal little interest
in any form of eros; yet 13th-century Iran & 19th-century Russia were
both intensely erotic & religious).  He described two syndromes that
scholarship has displayed:
1. The ""Why are there so many divorces?"" view, which overlooks genera-
   lizations by focussing too strongly on details.  In fact, there were
   many more broken homes in 1900 because more parents abandoned child-
   ren or died in childbirth.  But the turn-of-the-century US was a
   relatively nonerotic culture.  Compared to other EROTIC cultures,
   we don't have more divorces today; the higher divorce rate results
   from making romantic fulfillment rather than the establishment of
   families the goal of relationships.
   An instance of this view occurs when scholars attempt to explain
   the origins of the centuries-old Western preoccupation with roman-
   tic love.  They trace it to the institution of ""courtly love"" prac-
   ticed by medieval troubadours, yet are bewildered: why did it begin
   then & so abruptly & without precedent in the unerotic Middle Ages?
   Boswell says ""courtly love"" seems problematic only because the pre-
   ceding medieval centuries were so unerotic, and that culture had
   begun a shift back toward an interest in eros that had characterized
   the ancient West.
2. ""Christianity gave eros a poisoned drink"" (Nietzsche).  This view
   admits that Christianity has seemingly accomodated much of exist-
   ing erotic life but only to ultimately control, limit & rob it of
   meaning.  Boswell cites his own book's findings to contradict this
   view.
In fact, Christianity, like other world religions, has displayed a
varying attitude to eros.  Boswell listed four variations, found also
in these other religions:
1. Indifference, by far the most common attitude.  Religions are no-
   toriously very conservative culturally in that they cling to their 
   ""initial environments"" long after these have ceased to have any 
   social reality.  Christianity was born (legitimized) during a major
   shift in Western culture (in the 4th century) from an erotic to a
   nonerotic society.
2. Hostility, the next most common.  While Christianity as a whole has
   never been hostile to eros as whole, it's had its share of Khomeini's.
Boswell thinks these two attitudes largely suffice to explain the per-
manence of Christian homophobia once it was officially adopted in the
13th century.  An institution which was always largely indifferent would
never feel moved to suppress expressions of homophobia, which would occur
occasionally as minority or crank opinion even before 1200.
To emphasize how indifference and marginal hostility can interact to
produce results utterly divorced from the moral teachings of scripture,
Boswell outlined how misogyny became church principle & practice.

as difficult as making the decision to come out.  The reason I came out was
because I felt I could never lead a normal life as long as I was hiding such
a large part of my life.  How can you think positively about yourself if you
are constantly negating yourself?
How do you choose the right moment to come out to someone?  Well, I really
didn't want to make a big thing out of it - it shouldn't be a big deal - so
when someone would ask me what I did over the weekend, I'd tell them I went
dancing with Rick at the Foxhole, or I went to chorus rehearsal (Oh? What
chorus?  The Denver Gay Men's Chorus).  This kept me from acting a scene
out of ""True Confessions"", and allowed them to gloss over the matter without
a confrontation.
Coming out to my parents was different.  Whatever reaction they had, I didn't
want them to think they made me gay.  They could hate me, feel sorry for me,
anything, as long as they wouldn't think they were responsible.  As it turned
out, what hurt my mother most was that I hadn't told her sooner.  She still
worries about me (she's afraid I'll get knifed by a psychopathic lover, or
get AIDS), but I'm closer to my family than I've ever been before.

HOMOSEXUALS MAY RISK WEAK IMMUNITY  by Jon White
    Practices common among homosexuals may weaken their immune system, creating
an abnormality seen in AIDS patients, a study published Friday in the Journal
of the American Medical Association suggested.
    Another report in the Journal noted that 38 people have developed AIDS
following blood transfusions.
    The study lends support to the theories mtying homosexual practices to a
breakdown in immunity that causes AIDS.
    AIDS is aquired immunity deficiency syndrome, a condition in which a
person's normal body defenses against infection fail to function adaquately.
Patients with AIDS can become ill and die from infections that are easily
controlled by the immune systems of healthy people.  AIDS patients may also
develop cancers rarely seen in the general population.
    Since it was first seen by physicians in 1980, AIDS has been diagnosed
mostly in homosexual men, people who use intravenous drugs illegally, and,
to a lessor extent, Haitians and hemophiliacs.  It has been noted that homo-
sexuals with a high number of partners seenm to beat greater risk of AIDS than
those with fewer partners.
    The latest AIDS study, conducted at M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston,
found that even in men without symptoms of disease, anal intercourse is
associated with abnormalities of the immune system.
    The study, conducted by Dr. Giora mavligit and colleagues, focused on 30
asymptomic, monogamously paired homosexual men.  Nineteen of 26 men who were
recipiants of sperm anally showed laboratory evidence of an immune response
to their partner's sperm.
    No evidence of such a response was found in the four men in the study
who never received sperm during intercourse.
    The response in some of the men involved infection fighters called T-cells
and was the same kind of reation strongly associated with AIDS.  The
researchers also studied one heterosexual couple who regularly practice anal
intercourse and found signs of the same immune reaction in the female.
    These findings support the theory that sperm entering the the anal canal
are readily absorbed into a person's lymphatic and blood circulation systems,
where they may set up an immune response as if they were invading infectious
agents.

I cannot help but feel that there is a subtle ""political"" component in
the AMA article linking certain sexual practices with laboratory immune
deficiency disorders, and extrapolating that to the AIDS syndrome.  A bit
exaggerated, the argument goes as follows:
	""Subjects who participate in generally-considered-icky sexual
	practices show laboratory evidence of immune response to their
	partner's sperm.  Did someone say 'immune'?  Doesn't AIDS have to
	do with the immune system?  Could it be that people who engage in
	such vile practices might actually be bringing it upon themselves?
	Hear ye, and repent now.""
It reminds me a bit of Susan Sontag's expositions of the treatment of
tuberculosis and cancer patients in her book, ""Illness as Metaphor"".  The
chasm between labortatory-level immune system peculiarities and AIDS is
quite wide, especially given the epidemiological evidence which would seem
to implicate an infectious agent as the cause of AIDS.  We must remember
that the accused practice has been around for many millenia, as opposed to
AIDS, which has emerged only in the last three years.  
A similar study was published a few years ago implicating vasectomies in
auto-immune diseases.  In this case, men were showing symptoms of immune
reactions against their own sperm.  Now the researchers (presumably
themselves intact) weren't saying much about vasectomies and AIDS then, but
they were warning of arthritis and heart disease.  The fears stirred up by
that potboiler are only beginning to be dispelled by hard evidence showing
no increase in either disease in vasectomized men.
I should emphasize that I am not condemning basic research of any kind.
But a study's conclusions and presentations are not immune (sorry) to
deeply-ingrained bias.  Here, I'm trying to point out the ur-message
I see hiding beneath the respectable mantle of an AMA article.

I wish you had the nerve to put your own name on that article,
rather than logging into a public account to do it.  I would have
prefered to respond to you personally, rather than burden the net
with my flaming, particularly since opinions like yours are best
left ignored.  But I feel I must respond to this one.
I presume that, since you mention Jerry Falwell, you choose to align
yourself with that group of people who call themselves ""The Moral
Majority"" and consider themselves to be ""Born-Again"" Christians.  I
do not wish to attack Rev. Falwell here, nor make any assaults on
his teachings or followers.  I flame at the person who submitted the
above article, and no other.
Please read carefully the teachings of Christ as found in the New
Testament of your Bible.  I am a Christian, and am appalled at the
hateful, abusive, bigoted and self-serving things that some people
do in His name.  You in particular have demonstrated that you have
little or no concept of what Christianity is all about.  I will not
quote you scriptures or give biblical references, since you've
probably heard them all and still not learned.  If you do not live
your life in accordance with His teachings, if you twist His words
to suit your own meanings, if invoke His name to belittle, offend,
or mislead others, then your faith is a distorted one at best.  I
recommend that you check very carefully to see who your true master
is.  Lucifer is, after all, the angel of light.
I have two suggestions:
	1) For our sake, please keep your obviously inflamatory
	   statements off the net.  We don't need them.  I welcome
	   free and open discussion where everyone can speak (type?)
	   his or her own opinion, but cheap shots taken from behind
	   the cover of a public login are counter-productive.
	2) For your own sake, learn more of Him whom you claim to
	   follow.  You may be surprised.
Of course, my opinions are entirely my own and have nothing to do
with the opinions or policies of any organization I belong to or
company that employs me.

As much as I benefit of the flood of MAC-related articles here (and given
that I helped start it all), I am very concerned that it may be too much
and cannot be supported much longer by the net, and it's time to call for
all ""MACeteers"" to find ways to reduce the burden we are imposing on the
net, without losing any of the benefits (I hope, anyway). I think we better
do that ourselves, before folks with less interest in the MAC do it for us !!
If I have to chose, I prefer the posting of executable files over source
code, because it tends to be less volumenous and has the potential of
benefitting more people.  I, for one, am not very likely to try out programs
that first need compiling, but I do try to ""test-drive"" most executables
floating by.  And among the people that I pass downloaded stuff to, not one
in twenty is interested in source-code. 
Otherwise, I *URGE* that all sources be mailed to INFO...@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA
from where they can be accessed nation/worldwide by users on ARPA/MILNET
from the archives with the FTP-file-transfer program, and by all others
via regular mail by sending a request to INFO-MAC-REQUEST.  This has worked
very well over many years for CP/M and MS-DOS code (and much more),
archived  many different ARPA-sites.
All major MAC Users Groups have members who, routinely, download from
ARPA and USENET and thus the sources become available to all through
club-released disks and private BBSes.
For those of you who either live overseas, or otherwise in the ""computer-woods""
I recommend you link up to one of the larger MAC Users Groups to obtain their
weekly/monthly software disks and newsletters.  In my experience, getting
club-disks is certainly less time-consuming (and time is money, after all)
than downloading, and reduces the ""sifting"" and documenting the ""stuff"".
To summarize, it's great to benefit from USENET and ARPAnet, but let's not
forget what the main purpose of these computer nets are and what those
who pay the bills want to see achieved here, and while I certainly think
that some of the MAC-activity is related to those goals, too much is not
and we are running the risk of ""getting in troubles"" for overindulging
on ""fringe-benefits"" which are neither policed nor sanctioned.
I believe that making a ""sincere effort"" in moderation is indicated
here and will work in our favor in the long run (for both this particular
interest group and the net in general)

we've been having to decide which newsgroups can be thrown away and
which should be kept.  (I'm marking this to Followup-To to net.news,
it's being cross posted just for general interest).
This started with some angry glares following a high phone bill.
We took a look at the top 25 newsgroup list and found that about 45%
of the traffic listed there was of questionable quality and need.
I wrote my 'subscribers' shell script and set it running for awhile
to gather data for me, and the following list is the result.
This list has been posted to the local newsgroups and we'll have
some local voting and discussion about it, with a final decision being
reached in a week or two.  BTW, I've purposely put too many newsgroups
on this list because I'm hoping to jog some people into action.
For instance, net.bizarre actually has enough readers but is of
such low quality that I don't think anybody will miss it, and is
of such high volume that it'll make a big dent in our phone bills
if we throw it away.
Why am I posting a local administrative matter to the net
as a whole?  I'm hoping to raise consciousness on the net, and
start some general conversation about the usefulness of these groups.
Hopefully this will be the only large posting (And, please people,
don't quote the entire thing!)

David, sorry for the long inclusion, but there are two points:
1. Am I not getting all of net.music.folk? As a ""folkie"" I eagerly await the
   one or two posting per week average I see here. Hardly what I would call
   middle to high volume. Perhaps there is a site somewhere upstream of us that
   has decided that this group is worthless and has turned it off.
2. A small but not insignificant contributor to article length is.. (I know,
   it's been said a hundred times before!) long .signature files. I consider
   7 lines long (please, this isn't intended to be a flame!).

	We just went through the same problem, but since we are a computer
science department, we decided to keep only computer related groups.
The only large groups that we still get are net.sources and net.unix-wizards.
We managed to cut out about 75% of our news, the administration is happy,
and we realized how much of the news is crap.  All the talk about information
overload and the net collapsing under it's own weight is apparently true.

I recall) were that people were overflowing other notesfiles (lots of
abortion debates in net.women, lots of creationism debates in net.religion,

AIDS, at least until it begins to affect heterosexuals in larger numbers. It
is used by people who are different from most of the people they work with
to communicate with others like them across the country, with little
harassment (aside from Ken Arndt's random visits and those of shocked
bible-belters). It is also a way for straights to learn more about how gays
think and live, and education has to make acceptance easier, right?
And then we come to the groups close to my heart: net.aviation,
net.sf-lovers, and net.books. You can't justify groups like these as easily
as something like mod.sources, but many, many people read sf-lovers, not all
books are sf so it's nice to have net.books, too, (shouldn't we support
reading in this age of declining literacy?), and wherever you get a group of
pilots together they're bound to swap flying stories, and I love to listen
to flying stories. What would Jeff Williams do with himself if you did away
with net.aviation?
And while I don't read it myself, if there are readers in net.railroad I
think it should stay around, just out of respect for all the old- and
not-so-old-timers who got into this business through messing with model
railroads and blue boxes.

I think the point that krahl missed is that David posted a list of
newsgroups that were candidates for HIS SITE to stop supporting.  He
is in the process of finding out whether anyone on HIS SITE can make
a case for keeping any of the groups.  I did the exact same thing on
one machine I administer news on a few months ago, cut the disk space
used by about 20%, and the space used is currently higher than it was
before trimming groups that NO ONE ON MY SITE WANTED.  I am administering
news on a smaller machine now, as well.  The machine has a total of
102Meg of disk space and we get very few groups to start with.  Do the
news administrators have the right to stop supporting groups that should
be mailing lists (low volume) or moderated but aren't (low quality)?
You're damn right, we do.  If my users can't get their work done because
netnews is tying up too much disk space, or too many cycles, or too many
hours on the FOUR incoming or ONE outgoing lines on the system, we won't
support ANY groups at all.  Even in some parts of AT&T, the budget
allotment for netnews is ZERO dollars.  If krahl wants to pass around
a lot of crap with his cycles and dialers, fine.   I'll pass, thank you.

The first thing I noticed was where these two people are *from*!  The one
is an AT&T employee and probably doesn't have to worry about his phone
bills (:-).  The second is from a University and is expressing the exact
opinions which have been expressed around here.  i.e.  Given a limited 
amount of support for receiving news and a seemingly unlimited supply
of news, why is *EVERYTHING* necessary???
Yes, Mr. Krahl, I do want to lower the phone bill by cutting newsgroups.
And, no, I won't kill the net by doing so because I'm not asking the
net to kill newsgroups, I'm simply intending to cut them locally.  On
the other hand, if the net were to see this suggestion and agree that
all those newsgroups were worthless and needed to be cut I wouldn't cry.
What's a poor university to *do*?!?!?

Actually, when you're talkinga about removing availability of groups from a
small population, it makes sense to sample that population. If you're
talking about removing groups from a large population, you need a more
scientific approach. It WAS interesting, though to compare his stuff to
what is happening out here in the bay area where people are doing
readership surveys on a regional basis... I found it rather suprising which
groups don't seem to have a lot of following on a pretty wide ranging
basis.

	Archiving and accessing usenet articles with keyword lookup
			    chuq von rospach
			national semiconductor
			    (nsc!chuqui)
			last revision: 1/7/85
This is a preliminary description of a program that can generate and 
maintain an archive of usenet articles and allow looking up articles
based on the article-id, subject lines, or keywords pulled out of the
article itself. 
The basic calling sequence of this program is:
	arc [-q | -v ] <command_string>
<command string is the actualy command to execute. Available commands
are the following (minimum typing needed to be unique can be used):
add <filename> [<filename> [...]]
	adds the given unix filenames to the database. Must be done by
	the archive superuser. All files must be in usenet article format.
	If the filename is a directory all files in it (including more
	directories) are handled appropriately. This command is only 
	available to the archive superuser.
totape <id> [<id> [...]]
	the given id numbers are taken out of the database area and 
	placed in a directory so that they can be backed to secondary
	storage. All pointers to the articles are updated to show that
	they are not accessible from the system. This command is only 
	available to the archive superuser.
 
fromtape <id> [<id> [...]]
	takes the given id numbers out of the secondary storage directory
	and puts them back in the database, updating the pointers as 
	appropriate to make them accessible. This command is only available
	to the archive superuser.
ignore <keyword> 
	removes any references from the system for the given keyword and
	adds the keyword to the IGNORE file so that it will no longer be 
	used. Removing a keyword from IGNORE allows it to be used for 
	lookups, but does not regenerate keywords from the existing 
	database. There ought to be a way of doing this, but I'm lazy.
lookup [-i] <keyword>
	returns the filenames (article id numbers for the -i flag) of
	all articles which are referenced by the given keyword. This is
	useful for pulling references out of the database, using commands
	like ""print `arc lookup f77`"". Case is not significant.
 
	Future enhancement (maybe): allowing booleans for the keywords,
	as in ""arc lookup (net.unix-wizards | net.unix) & (f77 | fortran)""
	or some such syntax. This can be done without a lot of problem 
	with sort, uniq, and other tools, I think, using lists of article
	id's in various combinations.
subject [-i] <subject_string>
	does for subject lines what keywords do. <subject_string> can
	be a substring, i.e. a string such as ""vms"" will match all
	subjects with ""vms"" in it. Case is not significant.
article [-i] <article_id>
	does for the article-id of an article what keywords do. <article_id>
	can be a substring, so ""orca"" will return filenames to all articles
	posted by site ""orca"" (also ""orcan"", etc...).
 
idfile <id> [<id> [...]]
	returns the filename needed to access an article with a given
	id number. 
keywords
	Prints a full list of keywords known by the system. This list is 
	in 'dbm' format, which means that the order they are printed out
	will look random to all logical beings.
DEFINITIONS
<id> - an article id, guaranteed to be unique in the system. This is given 
	to the article when entered into the system, and is simply an
	incremented counter (there is, unfortunately, no data in the 
	usenet header guaranteed to be unique without a lot of
	pain, such as an article-id and a posting time or some such
	garbage). Basic definition of <id> is ""typedef id long;""
<keyword> - a keyword is any string of characters allowed by the function
	isalnum() (see ctype(3)) bounded by any non-allowed characters.
	the underbar (_) and period(.) characters are also allowed.
	All uppercase characters are mapped to lower case. Newsgroups
	the article was posted to and any words in the Keywords header
	line will also be stored as keywords.
<subject_string> - any legal Unix string. All upper case characters are
	mapped to lower case.
<article_id> - a string of the format <article_number>@<site>.<domain>
	as defined in RFC822, or any substring. All upper case characters
	are mapped to lower case.
FILENAME DEFINITIONS
The following defines are used for filenames in the system. Hardcoded
filenames will NOT be used. Period. (This is a hint to those that might
try to 'fix' this software later).
Define		default value		use
ARC		/usr/spool/newsarc	home directory for this thing.
IGNORE		ignore			Keywords to not build lookup tables
					for in the database.
ARTICLES	articles		stores <id> <article_id> one per
					line for each article in database.
SUBJECTS	subjects		stores <id> <subject> one per line
					for each article in the database.
KEYWORDS	keywords		Directory used to store keyword
					lookup table. All files accessed
					only through the FILEMAP pointers.
TAPE		Tape			Directory used to store articles
					that will be moved to magtape or
					other secondary storage.
DATA		data			Directory used to store the article
					database. All files are accessed 
					only through the FILEMAP pointers.
FILEMAP		filemap			dbm pointer file to access keywords
					and article database. See below.
 
The Filemap pointer file
Filemap is a dbm format file that is used to map keywords and id numbers
to the filenames needed to access them. The basic format is as follows:
	key:  I<id>
	data: <filename>
 
	key:  K<keyword>
	data: <filename>
 
<id> filenames are relative to DATA, <keyword> filenames are relative to
KEYWORD so that the system can be moved around easily by simply changing
a few defines and recompiling. The reason I'm doing this pointer lookup
at all is because I expect to have to change the internal structures of
both KEYWORD and DATA as they grow. Unix directory lookups are quadratic
in nature so if the directories get too large things slow down 
significantly. By using the lookup file I can change one pointer in a 
single place-- otherwise I'd have to track down references all over
the place when I want to change it. As I'm setting things up all I need
to do is change one function in the program and write a quick and dirty
program to relink the files appropriately. 
DATA internal structure
For now, I'm going to use the following algorithm to store files in the DATA
directory. Because I only need to generate a filename once (all other
references are made through FILEMAP) generation can be expensive. We need
to be careful to keep directories at a reasonable size, so a fairly bushy
result is needed. The current algorithm should also grow the number of
directories based on the number of files so the inodes lost to directories
will stay proportional to the number of files in the system.
char *idfile(id_num)
id id_num;
{
	char map[] = ""abcdefghij"";
	static char filename[MAXLEN];
	char id_string[MAXLEN];
	int i = 0, j = 0;
 
	filename[0]=""\0"";
	sprintf(id_string,""%d"",id_num);
	p = id_string[0];
 
	while (id_string[i])
	{
		filename[j++] = map[id_string[i++] - '0'];
		filename[j++] = '/';
	}
	filename[j] = '\0';
	strcpy(filename,id_string);
	return(filename);
}
KEYWORD filename generation
Because I expect to see many fewer keywords than articles (I HOPE!!!)
the generation of filenames is much simpler. Basically it is generated
by taking keyword[0] as a subdirectory, as in f/foo.

this list for additional help.  If more people run 2.10+ news and a notes
system that understands and responds to 2.10+ stuff, we'll have a more
efficient network.
The final note in my flame was that we make 2.11 totally incompatible
with previous releases - then serious Usenetters would upgrade!  I'd say
that with tonque-in-cheek if I could stop with the foot-in-mouth tactics.

1.  It allows the local netnews administrators to track down any problem

if the archive area is purged of old messages from time to time).
3.  It reduces the burden of sites that are trying to archive all netnews,
since they need only save the message headers.
As for what `require' means, I have three suggestions:
1.  That the next version of inews automatically store locally
generated news in a directory structure identical in structure to the
existing spool structure, containing links to the same files as are
entered into the spool structure.
2.  That when the automatic handler for answering requests for old
articles fails to find such an article, it forwards the request to the
netnews administrator's mailbox, to give him or her an idea of how
often it is appropriate to remove old news.
3.  That newnews administrators be requested to retain submitted articles
for at least 1 year.

with this system should be useful in designing a  more  sophisti-
cated archiving system later.
I have written two programs for accessing the the  archive,  both
of  which  work by sending mail to spanky!netar.  ""Getar article-
id"" causes the article with the given article id to be mailed  to
the  requester.   ""Lsar  newsgroup""  lists the titles and article
id's of all the articles in the newsgroup.  These  routines  will
be  posted to net.sources under the title ""Programs for accessing

Currently I archive everything rather than attempting to  predict
which  articles  people  will want to access.  I will log all ar-
chive requests and post a summary to net.news in a few months.
Anyone may access articles in fa.all, net.all and nj.all; but ac-
cess  to news items appearing in bell.all, btl.all, and ho.all is
restricted to systems in Bell Labs which are  known  to  spanky's
uucp  program.   At  the  moment  this  list  includes  very  few
machines, but I will be glad to add more on request.
I will wait a few weeks to allow some back articles to accumulate
in  the  archive  and  then  post a condensed version of this an-
nouncement to net.general.

burden to the site that has to keep all the news around.  I would
like to propose an alternate archiving scheme.
Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever.  There
should be a netnews control message which will command a site to
automatically mail the item to the requestor, or re-post the article
if there is a general interest.
To make this more useful there must be a complete index of article id's
and keywords.  The keywords should be more meaningful than the nonsense
that appears in some titles.  Each site maintains a copy of the index.
A program exists which extracts article id's which match the desired subject.
This list is sent out as a control message, and each system which has
an article in the list mails it to the requestor.
This way, we could be spared seeing the same questions and jokes from
new nusers (I just made that term up - pronounce it ""news-ers"").
They would just have to say ""get me articles on the meaning of foobar""
or ""send all lightbulb jokes"" .
The news posting programs would have to request keywords and a summary
line.  It could even print a list of all articles matching the keywords
when a new one is posted.  For example:
	""There are already 73 articles containing the meaning of foobar.
	 Are you sure you want to post #74?""
That's a little beyond most programs (other than the trb project),
but you get the idea.

newsgroups as of September 18. The newsgroups I consider useful are:

I did not archive the fa.* articles on the theory that they archived
somewhere on the arpanet. (If you dont like my choice of newsgroups,
put your disk space where your mouth is and start archiving that
group yourself).  I am willing to entertain serious requests that I
start saving a newsgroup I omitted (dont even try net.jokes or
net.ham-radio), but your argument had better be a good one. I am
opreating on the (perhaps off base) theory that if I dont think it's
useful enough to read, it's certainly not worth saving.
I also have net.unix-wizards dating back to October 17,1981 and
net.bugs dating back to Oct 30,1981.  (note that net.bugs includes
net.bugs.4bsd,etc)
The reason I am afraid to admit it and haven't until now, is that I do
not yet have a good method for retrieval. First, I am not going to do
it manually (for reasons that should be obvious).  Second, I am afraid
of the potential phone costs caused by unreasonable queries to the as
yet unimplemented automatic server.  (I shudder at the thought of
someone asking for the entire archive).
So, in summary, I am archiving them, but there is no way for anyone
else to retrieve them. I estimate that I can afford to keep about 1
year of news on line before I have to spool it to tape.
If anyone wants to implement a scheme for retrieval, I will be willing
to install it, but It must be workable. Eventually, I will  write one myself
""when I have time"".
I decided it would be better to start saving them without a
method of retrieval than to wait until I had a method
and small database.

It was an interesting show though I had the impression that ""eluding
the authorities"" was more similar to smuggling joints into a rock 
concert than romantic views of ""international espionage"".
One wonders why the Soviets would care whether such footage was
filmed or not(!??) But that is the nature of control - to try to
control everything whether it can be controlled or whether it makes
any sense to control it or not.
 
I found it most encouraging that the Peace activist who had been
arrested for distributing literature in Red Square and the
Russian who liked to befriend foreigners both had Nuclear Freeze
posters in their apartments!  Apparently sentiments for a 
Nuclear Freeze are more international than we might think.
Finally, before we get holier-than-thou about Soviet peace activists
being arrested for distributing literature we should remember that
the New York Supreme Court just recently ruled that anti-nuclear
activists distributing literature in malls in New York State could
be arrested for trespassing.
In New Jersey I have personally been threatened with arrest at several
malls for distributing literature.  Only after threatening a
suit by an ACLU lawyer have the malls backed down because New Jersey
courts, unlike New York, have supported people's rights to political
expression in malls. So that, yes, we *do* have the rule of law
in this country and protected political rights.  But one must fight
for them at every turn or powerful economic interests like Prudential
who owned the mall in New York, will take those rights away in
an instant.
The ultimate irony for me, is hearing ""libertarians"" defend Prudential's
""right"" to arrest people for distributing political literature!

There you go again, Tim.  There is absolutely no relation between the
situations in the U. S. and the Soviet Union.  Neither the U. S.
government, nor state or local governments, have attempted to curtail
your rights to distribute literature.  The only question is whether
the owner of private property should be able to outlaw the distribution of
literature (political or otherwise) on their property.  My opinion is that,
with only a few exceptions, they can.  Should you have the right to distribute
literature in a hardware store or barber shop if the owner objects.  No!
If it were my hardware store, and you were disturbing customers, I would
gladly call the cops.  This has nothing to do with the content of your
literature.  In contrast, on a public street, you are
perfectly free to distribute literature, provided you don't harass people
or block streets or building entrances.
	The only question, then, is whether a shopping mall is analagous
to a store, or to a public thoroughfare.  My personal opinion is that
it is more like a public thoroughfare and you should be able to distribute
literature.  However, this is a point upon which reasonable people can
disagree.  I understand the mall owner's point of view.  You make it
sound like ""powerful economic interests"" are trying to suppress dissent.
NO!!!  They are just trying to maximize the number of customers who shop
in their mall.  Must your rather peculiar political biases cloud
your judgment in everything?
	I'm not sure I would defend Prudential's right to arrest you
for distributing literature in a shopping mall, but I would strongly
support their right to do so in the Prudential Building.

	I find it simply incredible that a person with any conception
of reality in the Soviet Union could write the above.  There is absolutely
nothing in common between the policies governing dissent in the Soviet
Union and the laws that prohibit trespassing in the United States.  They
are completely alien to one another in origin, purpose, and effect. 
	The implicit comparison between pamphleteers in our malls and
the residents of the Gulag is sickening, and only belittles the plight
of Soviet prisoners of conscience.

The US government most certainly *is* curtailing my right to distribute
literature when its police authority is used to prevent my
exercise of that right.  Just as the governmental authorities in the
past used their authority to shoot and kill strikers.  Just as 
employees in the past were prevented from distributing union literature
in the workplace.  After a long struggle unions finally obtained both
the legally recognized right to strike and the right to distribute
literature in the workplace without retribution.  When Solidarity
tries to distribute literature in the workplace in Poland this is
hailed as a movement towards democracy. Suddenly it is *not* a movement
towards democracy to grant similar rights against private employers
in the US?
In the Soviet Union the argument is that all property, including Red Square,
is ""owned by the State"".  Since the State owns the property it has the
right to prevent people from exercising their democratic rights.
Tell me how this is any different than saying that simply because
a public shopping mall which holds community events such as
""Crime Prevention Day"" or ""Picatiny Arsenal Day"" is privately owned,
that therefore citizens lose all democratic rights.
Moreover imagine what happens when there *is no town square* or
public place except for the mall - what freedoms are left?

This is precisely how the courts have ruled that people have the right
to distribute literature in a given case.  The judgment according to
numerous court rulings in New Jersey is that as long as it can be
established as a ""question of fact"" that a mall is in fact a public
place similar in function to the town square of the past then 
people have the right to distribute literature as you suggest.
Moreover the mall must have become the major locus of community events.
The mall in which I was threatened with arrest is quite explicit in its 
claims, its name is ""Rockaway TOWN SQUARE Mall"". 
This mall 
has an annual exhibition from the Picatinny Arsenal, which makes
components for nuclear weapons.  The next week there were such 
community events planned as a ""Crime Prevention Day"", a ""Ladies Group""
and so forth.  If this mall can sponsor community events such as
a massive exhibition of propaganda for the military industrial complex
then surely the other side has the right to be heard.

Explain to me how having an exhibition glorifying military hardware
brings more customers than an exhibition celebrating Peace.
Moreover please explain to me how the present rigidly controlled
atmosphere of the shopping malls attracts more shoppers than would be
attracted if shopping malls instead allowed the sort of freedoms of
town squares for amateur musicians, puppeteers, and other artists
to entertain people freely.  The mentality of control by the corporate
owners of shopping malls is no different than the ridiculous mentality
of control demonstrated in ""Russia- Love it or Leave it"" in which
harmless and creative acts by individuals are suppressed for no
other reason than to exert control.  It is not even a question
of being a political threat, it is simply a matter of control
for malls to suppress not only the circulation of petitions but the
sort of free-spirited artistic creativity which used to be a normal
part of the town square.  I have taken some efforts to go to 
Greenwich Village many times to enjoy the street musicians and
other creative artists.  I deliberately avoid malls because they
offer no such creativity or spontaneity- not only do they not offer
such creativity they deliberately suppress it.  
Is this the sort of country we wish to become?

I agree with you on that point except for the right of employees 
in the Prudential Building to distribute literature to their
coworkers.  I am not arguing that anyone has the right to barge
in on private property under all circumstances.  What I am
arguing is precisely what the New Jersey courts have argued -
that in cases in which shopping malls have replaced town squares
as the locus of community events, in which shopping malls deliberately
sponsor community events and seek to be seen as the major public
place in a community (i.e. like Rockaway TOWN SQUARE Mall) that
the protection of our democratic rights means that people must have
the right to petition and distribute literature.  If not we
will wind up with a nation in which malls have replaced town squares
but allowed for none of the democratic rights of such town squares.
And so goes our democracy.

Jim, I am not saying that our country is currently equivalent to the
Soviet Union.  I noted that after a letter from an ACLU lawyer that
the mall in New Jersey apologized.  We *do* still have a rule of law
roughly based upon the Constitution. I would like to maintain that
system. Don't you?
 
However that should not blind us to possible threats to our
democratic rights.  Nor is it true that every transgression in the
Soviet Union leads to a Gulag.  In fact, if you had seen the Frontline
show ""Russia - Love it or Leave it"" you would know that while the
peace activist was arrested for distributing literature that at
the time of the TV interview she was living peacefully at home amidst
her Nuclear Freeze bumperstickers.  She was not sent to a Gulag anymore
than I would have been had I been arrested.  That does not mean
that she was not intimidated and prevented from exercising her rights.
Every day another shopping mall is built - in some newly built suburbs
there never is a town square since the shopping mall serves its
function from the beginning.  In other areas, the traditional town
square and its business district dies as the shopping mall replaces it.
In many communities, particularly in the New Jersey suburbs, the
shopping mall *IS* the locus of public activity and community events.
Shopping Malls have Boy Scout events, exhibits from local military
arsenals, and other ""community"" events.   They are *the only place*
where the public can go see such events and they are the locus of
community activities in exactly the same fashion as town squares.
In order to distribute political literature one does not do well in
a closet.  Nor is this any democratic ""freedom"" of any consequence
to be free to distribute literature in a closet.  The Soviet peace
activist had no trouble being arrested for her Nuclear Freeze 
bumpersticker in her own apartment.  She got in trouble for trying
to disseminate her views in public; rights guaranteed by the Helsink
Accords and the Univeral Bill of Rights.
If present trends continue then in many places there will be no
public town squares, only shopping malls.  What will become of
*our* political rights guaranteed under our own Constitution if
there is no place to distribute literature to the public?  If one
is simply not allowed to distribute literature where the public
actually congregates?  We will wind up with repression of democratic
rights similar to the Soviet Union, in which distributing literature
is to court arrest.  It does not matter to me if such repression
in our own country is based upon the rights of *private* property
while in the Soviet Union it is based upon the rights of *public*
property.  The end result is the same loss of democratic rights.
Nor does it matter to me if in our own country the punishment is
less severe - arrest and possible loss of a job versus eventually
being sent to a Gulag in the Soviet Union.  The denial of
civil liberties is wrong. Period.

You grant permission to the owner of the shopping mall to control the right
of free speech. The owner is not even forced to justify the dominion: ""He
owns the building and wants to maximize profit"" -- that simple fact is
enough for you to accept the domination.
Your proposed union of freedom and servitude is dismanteling to human
rights and cannot possibly be in the interest of a free society.
If this is whats happening: The corporations that own places of public
interest can judge at will which civil rights they allow the people to
exercise and which not -- then there is something wrong with that kind
of ownership and corporations should not be allowed to do so.
We are not talking about some weired, radical or life threatening behavior
on part of the public here. We are talking about something as simple
as distributing flyers.
If this, however, interferes with the interest of the owner of the
shopping mall, then those interests are to be questioned -- not the
civil rights!

NO! NO! NO!  The local police are acting on a complaint of the owner
of the private property.  What does this have to do with the US govt?
Also, the police do not have the power to decide the mall is a public
thoroughfare.  Only the legislatures or courts can do that.  Prior to

It's very different, because there is only one state, but many mall owners.
Or are you imagining one big dome over the whole country.-)
Moral: Stay out of countries where the state owns all the property!
However, I agree that a mall is like a public thoroughfare.  
	It's not your position on the public's right to dispense
literature in malls that bothers me.  I agree with it.   It is simply your
mentioning the failed attempt of one company to try and prevent distributing
literature in their mall in the same breath as the Soviet Union's all too
successful attempt to do the same in the entire country.  That trivializes
the desparate situation of dissidents and others in the Soviet Union, and
makes it look like the U. S. and U. S. S. R. have similar human rights
situations, except for degree.   That's a big lie.

Do you know the facts of this case? Because I expected to encounter a
hassle from the mall management and the police I brought with me copies
of several court rulings from various malls in New Jersey.  That
didn't matter one whit to the police officer OR the management.
In order to protect my civil rights do I have to go into court umpteen
million times?  Another mall had *already* been successfully sued
for preventing the Passaic County Nuclear Freeze from distributing
literature.  That didn't matter - they booted me out but said I could
call to get a table.  I was suspicious but willing to go along with 
their restrictions.  So what happens?
1)the management can hardly be tracked down to reserve a table.
  Finally to resolve the issue a Freeze member took 3 hours off of
  work and planted herself in the manager's office until she would
  talk to her
2)the Freeze member said she wanted a table for the next weekend:
  sorry, the manager said, but you *MUST* reserve the table for the
  whole week
3)OK, the Freeze member said, we want a table for the whole week
  sorry, the manager said, but you must reserve the table for the
  whole week thirty days in advance
4)OK, the Freeze member said, we would like to reserve the table for
  the whole week thirty days from now
  sorry, the manager said, but you must send me a letter on your
  organization's letterhead stationery and THEN I can send you
  an application. (thereby meaning another two week delay while
  the ""official letterhead"" stationery from the Freeze is processed
  and then an application (maybe) is returned from the mall, which
  then must be sent back again
5)OK, the Freeze member said, we don't have ""official letterhead""
  stationery but we will make some and send you a letter requesting
  an application for a table. By this time it will have to be for
  November or December.
  sorry, the manager said, but you can NOT reserve a table at ANY TIME
  during November and December because of the Christmas rush

It is hardly irrelevant when talking about the denial of current civil
rights and the threat this may pose in the future to point out that
such things have happened in the past.  Most Americans are never
taught the history of the labor struggle in this country.  How
company towns controlled every aspect of people's lives and made a profit
on every aspect of their lives.  For example, one company town paid their
workers with scrip that could *only* be used in company stores.
How workers were shot and killed in
the defense of the rights of private property. How workers were fired
and worse for distributing pro-union literature on private property.
During the Palmer Raids unionists and socialists were rounded up
and arrested for ""subversion"".  Many were placed in prisons for years.
During the McCarthy era many people were fired and blacklisted
for simply *knowing* somebody who was a Communist or leftist.
 
The replacement of public town squares with privately owned malls
poses the same challenge again: which will be respected, people's
basic civil rights of freedom of speech or the rights of private
property?
I believe in the end that this country *will* follow its deep
democratic traditions and protect people's rights to freedom of
speech over private property's rights of repression.  Just as
we finally did in respecting workers' rights to distribute literature
on private property and workers rights to strike.
But it will not happen without effort.  And it is part of the
ongoing struggle to increase democracy as was done during the union
movement and the civil rights movement. THAT is why history is relevant.

First off, let me say that I think we are in basic agreement on what
people's rights *should* be with regard to distributing literature
on private property.  Namely that people have this right not for all
private property but only when private property such as malls is
a public thoroughfare which serves as a community center and hosts
community events in the same manner as town squares.
I am glad that you agree with me on this.
 
On your objection to my raising the mall issue, I think you fail to see
my underlying point.  At NO TIME have I ever said that the US is
*equivalent* to the Soviet Union in terms of civil rights.  Even the
Palmer Raids, which were crass and overt violations of civil rights,
were a cakewalk compared to Stalin's massacres.  Moreover while most
Americans have forgotten how many workers were killed trying to establish
basic union rights, the right to grievance procedures and so forth,
such killings also come nowhere close to Stalin's killings. I am not
about to justify Stalin's policies.  At the same time, one must recognize
that Stalin has been dead for 30 years now.  The instruments of repression
in the Soviet Union no longer include the wholesale slaughter of Stalinism.
Instead they include summary arrest, the use of mental hospitals and
generalized censorship.  They also include restrictions on people's
rights to distribute literature in public places.
 
The American media is quite prolific and repetitive in pointing out
this restriction in the Soviet Union.  One can never see a documentary
on the Soviet Union which does not mention restrictions on people's
civil rights.  The presumption of course is that the United States
has NO such problems.  This presumption is *wrong*.
That is my point.
Yet the mainstream American media never point this out. If you live
in a suburb in which the mall is the community center in general
you do NOT have the right to distribute literature.  The New Jersey
Nuclear Freeze has found this problem in every mall we have ever
approached in this state.  It has only been pressure and actual
lawsuits which have forced some malls to change this policy.
Even then, as with Willowbrook Mall, they impose such restrictions
on literature distribution as to make it almost impossible to
actually practice one's right to distribute literature.
Certainly we should criticize other nation's restrictions of
civil rights.  But should the American media simply ignore
similar restrictions in our own country?  Isn't it even 
more important to uphold basic civil liberties in our own country
before criticizing others? If we do not respect civil liberties
in our own country then how can we pretend to be concerned about
such restrictions by other countries?
My point is that while criticizing other countries, we should not
pretend that we are a Utopian, ""holier-than-thou"" perfect nation.
Such an attitude promotes the oft-repeated chauvinist strategy of
painting the enemy as the devil and one's own country as God's
angel.  Thus justifying any atrocity which may be committed or
planned against the ""devilish"" opponent.
For instance:
  ""I have just signed legislation which outlaws Russia forever.
   The bombing starts in five minutes.""
FOR A FREER AMERICA!

Sorry, but there is a great deal of difference between the freedom given
to Solidarity (or lack thereof) and the freedom given to US citizens, to
distribute literature.  The reason distribution of literature by Solidarity
is considered democratic is that the government of Poland controls, in 
general, all the people's sources of information.  Am independent source
of information, such as the literature, is therefore a move by Solidarity
towards democracy.  In the US, if the organizations prohibited from
distributing literature in the mall were also prohibited from distributing
their literature everywhere else, the situation would be analogous to that
in Poland.  But the US government does not have total control of the media,
and unlike Solidarity, the pamphlet distributers DO have ways to legally
give their pamphlets out.  Poland is controlling what can be distributed,
while the US is only controlling where it can be distributed.

It is different because in the USSR, the state has a monopoly on ownership
of the property.  Privately owned property in the US is not all owned by
the same person--the pamphleteers can go somewhere else, to find someone who
will allow use of their property, and if they have property available to
them, they can use their own property.  In the USSR, the state is the only
game in town, and if the state says you can't do something, you can't try
to do it somewhere else.  And just because someone allows one group
(i.e. supporters of the Crime Prevention program) to use their property
doesn't mean they have to let everyone use their property--it's their
property, and they can decide what to do with it.
>Moreover imagine what happens when there *is no town square* or
>public place except for the mall - what freedoms are left?
Forcing the mall owners to allow pamphleteers to distribute material is
also depriving freedoms--the freedoms of the owners to not be forced into use
of their property for a cause that they do not support.
If you can't give out literature in one place, that doesn't mean your views
are being suppressed.  If there is ""no public place"", that would appear to
show that nobody is interested in your point of view, and you shouldn't
continue to proselytize to people who don't want to be proselytized to.
If enough people support your view, they can exert pressure on the mall owners;
in the USSR no such possibility exists.
Of course, if all the malls across the nation were owned by one company,
then the result would be significant restriction on the free speech of the
distributers of the literature.  But this is NOT the case in the US and IS
the case in the USSR--except the state is the ""company"" and it controls not
only malls, but radio, TV, books, newspapers, etc....
>Explain to me how having an exhibition glorifying military hardware
>brings more customers than an exhibition celebrating Peace.
You can't say that your exhibition is celebrating peace and someone else's
is not.  Rather, the other party believes peace can be achieved in one manner
and you believe peace must be achieved in a different manner.  The other
party may be wrong in thinking that military expenditures bring peace,
but that doesn't mean they don't support peace, just that they're wrong about
the methods necessary.
The reason the military exhibition brings more customers is that more customers
believe that the other people's methods will bring peace than believe that
yours do.

Because the shoppers disagree with certain beliefs and don't want to be prosely-

case of truly non-political artists, just because the mall owners and the 
townspeople decide that one should be allowed, that doesn't mean they have to
let everyone.

I think that Tim failed to discuss one of the most serious civil
right violation in the USSR.  The USSR severely restricts the
right of its people to emigrate.  If you don't like the US,
you can leave the country.  There are many oppressive governments
on this planet.  Yet, when it comes to emigration, the USSR and 
its satellite nations are at the top of the list.  Basically,
the USSR can be viewed as a giant prison camp for its people.

You have a valid point, although I think it is not true that the
USSR can be viewed as simply a giant prison camp for its people.
I support the right of all Soviets to freely emigrate, if they wish.
Perhaps (??) the release of Shcharansky indicates a future opening of
Soviet emigration policy.  But there has been no evidence of that as yet.
But again, let me point out that my point was hardly to *condone* Soviet
human rights abuses of all sorts - my point was that if we do not
watch out we will wind up with a similar situation in our own country.
Distibuting literature at shopping malls has been treated as a ""trivial""
problem.  But I do not think it is when also considered in conjunction
with the blatant censorship of the press during Grenada, in conjunction
with forced lie detector tests in the highest levels of government,
in conjunction with FCC policies which threaten to allow media monopolies
throughout the country, in conjunction with attempts to make all government
employees take an oath that they would *never* reveal what they had
learned in office, even after leaving office.
Another very real threat is the enormous increase in research and development
spending for the military on classified projects which Star Wars threatens
to increase to even larger proportions.  As part of this militarization
of research more and more restrictions are being placed upon rights to
publish and basic academic freedoms.
The point is to *avoid* becoming another Soviet Union, not to
""defend ourselves"" by simply becoming like the Soviet Union ourselves.

I don't mean to sound flippant.  However, done by such a company town,
it would be called exploitation; done by the State, it would be called

That's what _I_ was taught in school.  What they didn't teach us (and I
had to find out by my own reading) was that labor unions weren't just
victims -- there were times that they *started* the violence by dynamiting
the barracks of non-union labor brought in to replace union laborers.
I'm sure Tim has all sorts of excuses for labor unions killing people
(after all, Tim believes in PEACE), but the fact remains: labor disputes
had plenty of violence on both sides, and I wouldn't get too much of a
""holier-than-thou"" tone about it.
Remember: a labor union is more properly termed ""labor monopoly"".  A group
of laborers attempt to restrict supply of a commodity (labor) in order to
drive up the price of the commodity (wages).  It is not surprising that
labor unions in a free market have a hard (perhaps impossible) time 
monopolizing the labor supply, for the same reason that companies in a 
free market have a hard (perhaps impossible) time monopolizing a market.
It is also not surprising that labor unions resorted to violence and
intimidation, much like some of the robber barons of the last century did.
What IS unacceptable is to claim that only businesses used violence to
achieve their ends.  What IS unacceptable is to ignore how widespread
union violence is today to intimidate employers into giving in (sabotage,
tampering with Hormel meat products, hiring sharpshooters to blow out
utility company transformers) and to coerce workers into joining a union
or supporting a strike.
Tim, go ahead and deny it happens.  (Hitler's Big Lie technique is firmly
in use by socialists and unionists today.)  It happens every single day
in this country.  The U.S. Supreme Court found the use of sharpshooters
to destroy transformers ""a legitimate collective bargaining technique""
in 1973.  My father was a union man and knew well what would happen if
he were to cross a picket line.  The lies that labor unions don't engage
in large scale violence TODAY don't hold anymore.

Union.  Some of you may think that my views are biased, that I am a 
""hardliner"", but here it goes.
Some of you mentioned that in the USSR all property belongs to the 
State and this is the reason why the State ""has the right to prevent 
people from exercising their democratic rights"".  By the Soviet law, 
everything in the USSR belongs to the people, including the State 
itself!  Preventing people from distributing any kind of literature is 
a violation of this law.  But this is on a side note.  The main issue 
is, of course, the absolute irrelevance of comparison between a 
shopping mall and the Soviet state.
I came to the USA with the only purpose: to be free.  Free from the 
government intervention in my business, whether commercial or 
political.  So, if I buy or lease a store at a mall, I expect that 
nobody tells me what to do there.  Including my right to set the rules 
in the store.  And if I don't anybody distributing literature there, I 
have a right to have the police to protect my property because all I 
want is profit.  If I own a mall or a corporation, I should expect to 
have similar rights.  IT IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.  I may exaggerate a 
little, but that is my way of thinking.  But it is way overboard to say 
that in order to have a right to free speech Tim Sevener has to own a 
mall...
What many of you didn't realize about distributing literature on Red 
Square is the following:  The authorities are not concerned about 
distributing Soviet literature.  They are afraid of distributing 
""non-approved"" literature, ""samisdat"" or something smuggled from the 
West.  That's why they first grab the people there and then see who 
they got and for what.  The authorities are really scared of this kind 
of literature, because it may contain the facts that are kept secret 
for the Soviet public.  Do you know, for instance, that in order to 
make a Photostat copy of any document one has to get to authorizing 
signatures?  And this is at work, there are no copiers in libraries, 
post offices and such.  
As far as American media's interpretation of the Soviet life is 
concerned, after living in Moscow for 30 years, I know and said it 
many times that life there is worse then you see it on TV here.

Is this question supposed to be serious or rhetorical? After all, it is
pretty obvious that exhibits of militaria attract a lot of people. Kids
love to clamber over tanks and play with artillery and sit in cockpits
and vehicles. This brings along their parents, who are potential
customers, as are the kids themselves and anybody else who came to see the
exhibits. Maybe other exhibits would attract more than these; it is now
up to you to design and produce one, and make it available to the mall
owners. If it does attract more, they'll be happy to provide space.
What *are* you going to exhibit to ""celebrate Peace"", though?
Reproductions of famous treaties? A mess of doves? A blacksmith beating
swords into plowshares?
For what it's worth, though, I agree that malls should be treated like
public streets, in terms of political access. Just because they are
under a roof, and the trash collection is handled by a private party
instead of a municipality, doesn't change their essential character,
which is a direct descendent of the community ""shopping district"" or
""business district"", and whose roles the mall has usurped.

No, because the mall owners, etc... don't all make same resrictions.  Surely
there's a mall somewhere which has an owner who would allow you to give out
pamphlets.  Or if not, an organization somewhere which will let you use its
facilities to give out pamphlets.  Or, for that matter, a street corner, park,
etc... where you can legally give out pamphlets.  In the USSR the state
controls everything.  There's a great difference between not being allowed
to do something everywhere and not being allowed to do it anywhere.

Actually, not necessarily true.  Back in the early '70s, when

1)in the United States so far as I know there are no towns totally
  owned and controlled by the State (unless you wish to count
  military bases, which actually generally come under separate and
  independent municipal jurisdictions)
 
2)there were no elections to determine either officials or policies
  of  company towns when they existed. The company, usually owned and
  controlled by either one family or one person, determined everything
  autocratically.  Such is *not* the case with local governments.
  Even if they may be controlled by elites, they at least must face
  elections.  Many machines have lost their power by being voted out
  of office. (e.g. Daley's previously invincible machine lost the
  mayor's office)

I don't disagree with Tim that there those who would like to restrict
our freedom in the US.  Tim is pointing mostly in the direction of
the military establishment, but I feel that if there is a danger, it
comes from the religious right.  I think it is possible to make intersting
analogies between the Soviet communists and the fundamentalist
religionist in the US.  You just have to substitute ""Marxism, Leninism""
dogma by ""Bible, God"" dogma, and you will see what I mean.  Reagan
and others try to portray the US, that unlike the atheistic USSR, 
has the Bible and God on our side. In contrast, Gorbachev would justify
his actions as Marxist Leninist.  The emphasize on the distinction between 
the US and the USSR should be on freedom and the lack of freedom, rather
on dogmatic differences. 
Back to your point.  I think trying to equate the present condition in
the US to the USSR is an offense against human intelligence.  Naturally,
there some who would like to transform this country to a totaliterian
system,  but excluding a terrible catastrophe, I feel they would have
a difficult time achieving their goal.

No, Tim.  You don't have to own a mall.  There are still public areas that
are accessible, even if only a curbside on the approach to the mall.  What,
you say that no one will bother to stop their car and read your petition?
Too bad.  These are private citizens choosing to take their commerce to a
specific place; most of them are fully aware that a mall is private property.
There is no law *forcing* people to spend some of their time on public
property just so every organization can make the most of its free speech.
Those who seek this (such as you) can choose to boycott malls, for example.
If there are enough of you, malls will wither and downtown squares will
prosper again.  Or, you can attempt to reach people in other ways: mailings,
telephone calls, door-to-door visits.  You can invite everyone to *your*
home and have no restrictions on who sets up tables or gives out flyers.
The point is still that malls are private property, used as the owner sees
fit.  Having a significant portion of the ""community life"" happen at a mall
doesn't require the owner to relinquish property rights.  After all, in
some communities the church building is an important location for social
intercourse.  Should a synagogue have to provide ""equal time"" for the KKK
once it allows B'nai B'rith, for example?
Of course, this whole issue is separate from the story of how property
was allocated in the first place.  But most of American society (and all
of American jurisprudence) accept the concept of private property, so it
looks like we'll have to take that as a given.

------------------
A dastardly right-wing plot to stifle dissent has been uncovered
by super-sleuth Tim Sevener.  At a secret meeting, Ronald Reagan,
Edward Meese, Jerry Falwell, Jesse Helms, Secretary of Defense
Weinberger, and former Interior Secretary James Watt have agreed
to build a large shopping mall covering the entire country.  The
shopping mall would then be sold for one dollar to Ed Meese, who
would then prosecute anyone distributing unauthorized literature
on his property.
	President Reagan expressed a worry that
the cost of the project might necessitate a tax increase, but
Secretary Weinberger assured him that the entire project could be
brought in with only a 5% real increase in the defense budget.
Jerry Falwell expressed concern that the project would result
in unmarried men and women sleeping under the same roof.  Senator
Helms said that the whole idea was a Communist plot.  Secretary
Weinberger reminded Helms that it was Helms' idea in the first place.
Secretary Weinberger requesed an additional five billion dollars to
write the required 100,000,000 page environmental impact statement.
Ed Meese replied that the impact statement could be waived.  Secretary
Watt replied that that would be a bad idea, as the paper for the
impact statement could be easily obtained by cutting down all the
trees in Alaska and Washington State, plus the California redwoods.
Secretary Weinberger requested an additional five hundred billion
dollars to include a laser anti-missile system in the mall roof.
	All expenditures were approved without dissent.

There is a very important distiction between a private citizen's house and
a corporate mall. A corporation is an artificial entity the owners of which
(shareholders) are protected from any legal action from private people.
The corporation is a creation of the state, it has a charter from the state,
therefore it should be subject to the same cival rights requirements that
apply to the state.

I would notice that synagogue is a meeting place of a specific religious
community, and not explicitely open to the general public, like a mall.
The shop interior is designated for people to come and shop, but the
main alley of a mall does not have this specific character.
If we provide examples, I also will give one.  I live in a complex
of 40+ appartment houses owned by a single company.  Would it be
right for the management to request asking their prior permition
before canvassing the appartments to solicit donations?  Would it
be right for the management to throw out a girl scout or a proseliting
Mormon?  Or a peace activist?
By the way, what is the status of the parking lots of shopping plazas,
which are the favorite places in my semi-rural community for people
collecting donations?
If their status is the same as of the interior of a mall, then I think
that my rights are seriously courtailed.  Why should I be forced to
communicate with pamphleteerers only when I am driving, and when
I need to obstruct the trafick to stop my car?
Bob ignores the reality in most of American communities, where we usually
are either driving, or we walk on some private property.  If a place
is designated for walking for the general public, it should be treated
equally as a public sidewalk or alley.  Otherwise some of the rights
of the general public are curtailed.
When Tim is thrown out of a mall, not only his rights are abused, but
also the rights of people who would gladly pick a leaflet or tell him
that the peace movement is dumb; an activity which is an obvious right
on a street of a city.

Mr. Foy is here rebutting the idea that the owner of a mall should be
able to refuse entrance to pests, just as the owner of a home can, since
a corporation it subject to the same...[see above].
Note that Mr. Foy, who works for Aerospace Corporation, states, in effect,
that Aerospace Corp. cannot refuse entrance to pests; that if it allows
customers to come in and do business with it, then it must allow
the general public to come in and distribute literature.

Are you saying that if an individual builds a mall, then he should
be able to keep people he doesn't like out, but a corporation
(even if 100% owned by the same individual) cannot do this?
My own feeling on this is that a mall owner should be able to restrict
political activity (and other non-shopping activities), but that there
should definitely be something like the ""Equal Access"" for political
broadcast ads -- if one group is let in, then others should be let
in under similar conditions.  Or no political groups could be let in.
I believe that our freedom of religion needs us to allow churches
and other similar situations to be exempt, in that a synagogue does
not have to allow the KKK equal time.  However, if a Seventh-Day
church is rented out to another congregation on Sunday, should
they be forced to rent it out on Monday as well (even if the Monday
people were Satanists?)

Actually, a better response would be to eliminate laws that provide
corporations with a special legal status and special legal privileges.
If people wish to deal with a company under those terms that are currently
in force for dealing with corporations, they should be free to agree with the
company to do so, but there should not be any special priveliges granted to
corporations by legal edict.  Note, many of the terms under which corporations
operate, such as limited liability, are dicounted by those who deal with them
anyway.

If a significant percentage of people who avail themselves of malls wish
to see the dissemination of such literature, mall owners will have no choice
but to oblige them, or see business go elsewhere.  If very few people care,
well, that's democracy in action.  It seems to me that you so often sing
the praises of democracy, Tim, why not now?
>If one

It is not clear that it is necessary to be ""where the public congregates""
in order to reach it.  Modern telecommunications technology has provided
means to communicate easily with masses of people, such as cable television,
this and other networks.  There may well be other means that have occurred to
neither you nor I.

The real distinction is this:  There are (for the sake of simplification)
two types of property.  The first type is private property controlled by
an individual.  By this I mean things like my car, my house, my personal
tools, etc, that I actually use.  It also includes my means of production
if I am an individual producer.  For example, it would include my dental
tools and office equipment if I were a dentist.  In a very real sense I
can be said to own and operate this property personally.
The second type is what I will call social property.  A good example is
a steel mill.  I can't operate a steel mill all by myself.  A steel mill
has value and utility only if there is an organization to operate it.
The same is true of a shopping mall.  No one ""owns"" a shopping mall in
the sense that they ""own"" their house.  The important thing about social
property is that there must be organizations to operate it, and, in all
but very primitive societies, the rules under which these organizations
operate and exist are defined by the society as a whole.  The debate
between the proponents of classical capitalism and those of socialism
can be viewed as one about the ""best"" approach towards regulating the
control and operation of social property.
In my opinion it is an error to confuse the two.  Claims that forced
permission of leaflet distribution in shopping malls are the same kind
of thing as giving the general public the right to enter my house without
my permission are misleading, nor is the issue one of the formal ownership

   This seems a specious argument at best.  Are you saying that you have
the right to distribute literature in a mall owned by a corporation, but
not in one owned by an individual?  Why would this make a difference?

The best form of democracy as I see it involves not simply rule by
the masses but protection of individual rights and civil liberties,
protection for the rights of alternative viewpoints, however repugnant,
to express themselves in public.  What is so reprehensible about the
Soviet Union and other Leninist dictatorships is that no such civil
liberties are allowed.  Dissenters have no place to dissent without
the approval of the authorities.  Let us turn your argument around,
Mike: ""if a significant percentage of the Soviet people wish to
see literature in Red Square they will press upon the Soviet authorities
for that right.""  But why should they *have* to beg askance from
the authorities?  To acknowledge such a demand in the first place is
to acknowledge that there is no room for dissemination of opinions
outside of that acceptable to the authorities.
By the same argument to say that the expression of opinions in our
own country depend upon their profitability for narrow interest groups
would mean that ""freedom of speech""  is really no such thing at all -
it would become just as dependent on the whims of authorities
(even if different authorities) as public expression in Leninist
dictatorships.
I find it incredible that ""Libertarians"" whose utmost concern is
supposedly ""freedom"" could support such repression of free speech!

Why distinguish between ""social property"" and ""personal property"" based
on whether one person can operate it or not?  Why not make the distinction
based on whether one person can *build* it?  This seems just as valid,
perhaps more so, since an automated steel mill MIGHT be operable by one
person, but would certainly require many people to build it.  This
distinction seems designed to justify the status quo concerning leafletting,
rather than a realistic basis for treating a mall differently than a
church or home.

Oh no, those evil capitalists are at it again!  
Really, one organization doesn't own all the channels of communication,
at least in the US.  (In the USSR, the situation is, of course, exactly
that--the state has a monopoly on information sources.)  Even if there
are so many ""moneyed interests"" who ""control the channels of communi-
cation"", they don't all agree with one another, so different opinions
do get expressed.

The point was that the mall managers have to respond to the shoppers' desires.
If they do not, the shoppers can shop somewhere else.  As for people supporting
the views if they don't know them, obviously they DO know at least enough
about themto not want to be exposed to them in the mall, and their desires
about this are widely enough known that the mall managers know this also.

It is possible for shoppers to dislike some types of proselytization more
than they dislike others.  That is the shoppers' right.

OK, let me clarify:  The owners don't want such use of their property
because it alienates shoppers.  Being forced to allow their property's
being used in such a manner reduces their profits from shoppers, thus
making them lose money.
I cannot imagine a shopper who buys one product in preference to another
because the product is advertised with an advertisement that says nothing
about the product itself or the product's price.  Yet such ads obviously
are effective.  Other shoppers often do things for reasons that you or I
might not.

In Bergen County Mall volunteers for a political candidate were threatened
with arrest for placing leaflets on cars in the parking lot.   Thus
mall owners would extend their censorship of free speech not just
*inside* the mall itself but to all entrances and the entire parking
lot.  The New Jersey courts decided that such a threat was an unlawful

Several passersby, besides signing the petition I was
distributing also commended me for taking the trouble to circulate
a petition on a very important issue.  Indeed, one man said he
could not agree with my political viewpoint but that he 
supported my right to express it.  As he said, that is what is
great about America!  Ironically, a few minutes later I was
expelled under threat of arrest from the shopping center management!

I think that there is probably a legal distinction between handing out leaflets
and placing them on peoples cars, since the cars are most assuridly private

truth, and I suspect even most of the people who try to deny the
truth (like our prolific Tim Sevener) know the truth.  It just goes to
show the power of the lie.
Of course, truth has a power too, it just takes longer to show.
As that evil man A. Lincoln said, 'you can fool some of the people ...'
Incidentally, Tim, how do you think the Lincoln administration would
rate in terms of willingness to negotiate, freedom of the press,
repression of opposing politcal views, electoral fraud?  I'm sure
that Marcos had nothing on Abe.  That is why I refered to him as 'evil'.
Maybe we could have a human rights commission that would evaluate 
the Federal Government's behavior.  Then we could oppose that behavior
even if the South won the Civil War!  There's nothing like standing on principle, eh.
What that's you say?  You say the previous paragraph is absurd?  
It doesn't seem founded in reality.  Do I really want the South to win?
What's wrong with me anyway?
Just joking Tim, we all know that you REALLY post all these articles
to stimulate discussion.  Right?  You really don't think that if
the Communists take over the world (excepting the vile part know -
in a typically ethnocentric way - as America), right Tim?
The difference between the supression of speech in the USSR and in a  
mall is that the USSR can impose any penalty, including death if the
party (CP that is) feels like it.  What is the worst that you can

	Point well taken.  [Actually I don't give a damn about leafletting
in malls one way or another.]  ""Personal property"" normally has the char-
acteristic that the labor cost of bringing into existence is less than a
single persons lifetime.  However I did mean ""operate"" in a more general
sense.  Even if the steel mill is completely automated somebody has to
market the steel, somebody has to negotiate contracts for delivery of
ore to the mill and steel to the customers, etc.  Most property has the
characteristic that it has an associated function.  The distinguishing
feature of ""social property"" is that the exercise of its function requires
an organization and that its principal value is to an organization.  For
example, an office building is ""social property"".  Granted that people
could take shelter in it; however it was not designed for that and does
not serve that purpose very well.  [Obvious question -- how does one
classify an apartment building?  An army barracks?]
	One important feature of ""social property"" is that there must
be an institution associated with it -- it may be a company, a church,
a government, a club, a university, whatever.  [Yes, churches are
different from homes.]

1)to gain access to electronic media in general one has to have $$$$$
  Should every political organization be rich to promote their views?
 
2)even *granted* $$$, there is no guarantee that one will be allowed to
  place critical views on the electronic media.  Helen Caldicott tried
  to place a Public Service Announcement on all 3 American networks
  (which are not *free*) and was not allowed to.
  The College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were also banned from
  placing their ad on the importance of responsibility in preventing
  pregnancies.  They took no explicit stand in favor of contraception
  or abortion but simply suggested that one should consult an
  obstetrician and carefully consider pregnancy.
 
3)I have seldom seen a representative from the Physicians for
  Social Responsibility, the Nuclear Freeze, SANE, or other peace groups
  asked to join panels commenting on speeches or programs dealing
  with the arms race.  Such panels are almost always stacked with
  members of the Foreign Policy Establishment -e.g. Kissinger,
  McNamara,etc.  While I have great respect for McNamara, his views
  hardly represent the many people involved in the Peace Movement.
 
  Thus I find it peculiarly ironic that ABC should catch flak for
  allowing Vladimir Posner to respond to Reagan's vast collection
  of lies and distortions in his defense speech.  How is it that
  a *Soviet* spokesman can get broadcast time but Randall Forsberg,
  Retired Rear Admiral Gene LaRocque, Helen Caldicott, Bernard Lown
  and other representatives of American peace groups who are
  critical of *both* sides part in the arms race can never get
  such time?  Perhaps the reason is that a Soviet's responses
  can be more easily labelled as ""propaganda"" than a response
  from *American* peace groups.

some below, as they come to me -- others may well think of still more
types, or sub-divisions of these types, as this is by no means
exhaustive. ""Proper"" or allowable or tolerable behavior may well be
different on theses different types of property. (What is ""proper"" is,
of course, determined by those with the greatest power -- usually those
that have the guns. This usually equates to those controlling the police
or army.)
Public property: The traditional city street and sidewalks. Note that
behavior on this is already restrained by ordinances regarding
traffic-blocking, permits required to set up a stand and sell goods, etc.
Municipal (public) funds pay to maintain these areas.
Public/private property: The private street, where the owners' funds pay
for the maintenance rather than municipal funds being used. Security is
provided by private guards, etc., though the municipality is called in
for serious police work or fire-fighting, etc. [I really am unsure as to
the legal status of public access to such areas. Anyone have facts on this?]
Personal private property: Owner-occupied real estate; your home. Note
that ""a man's home is his castle"" is no longer true -- occupancy
permits, laws about such things as pet ownership and smoke-alarm
installation already restrict what you do in the privacy of your own
home, even if you own the building and land. Condo association or
subdivision regulations or deed restrictions may also apply.
Rented personal private property: A home location rented from some other
person, as an apartment. Rights of occupant further restricted by lease
(either explicit or common-law).
Private business property: A factory or plant, for example, where the
general public does not have access, but which is open to the owners and
to those they have hired to work there, or contracted with for services,
or allowed access for business-related reasons (utility company people
coming in to read a meter, for example).
Limited-access public business property: A wholesale-to-the-trade
showroom, for example, to which access is granted to those persons
meeting some standard of group membership, such as ""buyer for a retail
outlet"" or ""purchaser in some quantity"". The nature of the restriction
must be posted or otherwise publicly proclaimed.
Quasi-public business property: A retail outlet, store, or service site,
where members of the public are allowed or encouraged to enter to shop
or to purchase services or inquire about such. If you enter, but do not
buy, browse, or engage in some form of trade relationship with the
proprietor, you may be legitimately requested to leave. Your presence in
this area is predicated on the presumption that you are there to trade.
Fully-public business property: The prime example is the mall, where all
this discussion originated. This is NOT the individual store or shop in
the mall, which falls under the preceeding category, but the area
outside the stores, to which access is granted the general public, in
the hope that they will in turn enter the stores to spend money. Note
that there is no requirement or contract to the effect that, once you
enter the mall, you *must* subsequently enter a mall shop to buy or
browse or otherwise interact with the actual retailer; you have a legal
right to enter this mall, even if it is private property, because it is
held out as available for access by members of the general public. You
can go and just sit, and it is legitimate. 
In the light of the above, I would equate ""public property"" with the
""fully-public business property"", in that legitimate free-speech
political actions should be allowed in both. Even though I probably
would violently disagree with everything Tim would say or the leaflets
he would distribute, I agree with him that access to this sort of area
should be allowed, despite that some person or organization happens to
own it.

1)I may not agree with the American Nazi party as they march through
  Skokie.  Does this give me the right to censor their opinions?
  Freedom of speech involves some amount of irritation.  If this
  becomes excessive or obnoxious then some control may be needed.
  In the New York Supreme Court case banning leafletting
  in New York malls, the court itself agreed that leafletters 
  were unobtrusive.
 
2)Please present some evidence that leafletting in malls is either
  disliked or reduces profits for the mall.  My own personal
  experience was that several people commended me for concern
  about the arms race.  You will have to counter this evidence.
  As I mentioned previously a discussion
  with one person who disagreed with my position ended with his
  support for everyone's right to express their views in America,
  regardless of what they were.  I support the right of Nazis
  as well as all groups to disseminate their views.  That is
  what freedom of speech is all about!
 
3)Shopping mall managers seem to have no qualms about stores 
  distributing advertising leaflets on cars or within the malls
  themselves.  Are advertising leaflets somehow ""less obtrusive""
  or less detracting to customers?  I cannot believe so.
 
  It still baffles me how supposed ""Libertarians"" ""propertarians""
  ""Objectivists"" or whatever can be so eager to deny basic
  Constitutional rights!

I *never* claimed that the US and USSR were equivalent.  I have
enormous admiration for our freedoms and defense of people's human
rights in this country.  What I *AM* concerned about is concentrations
of power which threaten such freedoms and human rights and threaten
to make our country more and more like the Soviet Union.  I have
stated this again and again - apparently however any criticism of
disturbing trends in our own country is not tolerated by some people.
 
More disturbing is the following:

This is an age-old tactic: any criticism  of one's own country is
labelled as ""consorting with the enemy"".  This tactic *is* one which
is used in many countries, the USSR as well as the US.  The difference
as has been properly pointed out is the degree to which such attacks
result in actual repression.  In the Soviet Union one can be sent to
a Gulag for repeated dissent branded as ""unpatriotic"".  In the US
one may be sent to jail for a short legally defined term.  Unless
one is in a stage of right-wing hysteria such as McCarthyism during 
the 50's when people were systematically blacklisted for years.
Even then this is obviously better than being lined up before a
firing squad as happened in the Stalinist purges.  But is either
behavior to be condoned? I hardly think so.
Does anyone on the net?

Tim - Your basic inability to comprehend the issues involved never ceases
to amaze me.
	1) A mall is private property.  Nowhere in the constitution is
(or should it be) it stated that you have the right to distribute literature
on someone elses property without their consent.  Your ""free speech"" does
not give you the right to distribute literature in my home or my place
of business.
	2) Some (including me) believe that the unusual ""public thoroughfare""
character of shopping malls (they are like enclosed streets) makes it
desirable to allow literature distribution in malls (not in the individual
businesses) even though they are private property.  It is not at all
clear to me that this is a ""Constitutional"" right, however.  Were I on
the N. J. or N. Y. Supreme Court, I would have to think long and hard
about the matter (assuming the absence of state or local statute guaranteeing
such access to malls, or such provisions in the state constitution).  You imply:
	a) It should be obvious to anybody that the U. S. Constitution
guarantees your right to distribute literature in a mall.
	b) Anyone who doesn't agree with a) is a total idiot or an enemy
of freedom of speech.
	c) The U. S. government is oppressing you by not interfering with
the mall owner in his exercise of his perceived property rights.
	It seems obvious to me that a), b), and c) above are all ridiculous.
Do you seriously believe them?  If so, you need help.

which makes a mall a public place is that anybody is let in, and allowed to
remain, whether they have any business there or not.  (This is, in general,
only true during the hours they are open; the right of the mall owners to
close the place at night is unassailable.)  This is quite different from a
home, where the public may not enter, or a church, which is likely to let
anyone enter, but is likely to require that they participate in the service.
The right to free speech in a public place, so long as it doesn't interfere
with the owner's intended uses, is quite properly guaranteed by the courts
on the basis of the first amendment.  (The interference clause would rule
out blocking access, or setting up a loudspeaker system which interferes
with the ability of those in the stores to conduct business.)
Mr. Sevener is thus quite right to be outraged about having been denied
access to a mall for leafletting.

I did not claim that there exist a ""capitalistic conspiracy"".
However, there are poll results which exhibit that corporate officers
have in average political opinions which are much to the right of the
average of the public as a whole.  Thus the distribution of propaganda
trash like ""Plain Truth"", interprets the Bible in a way which ""shows"" that
the welfare ""against the God's law"" is much easier than the distribution
of ""peace literature"".

Sorry, but this is a peace of bullshit.  I NEVER heard about somebody who
prefers mall shopping over down-town shopping BECAUSE in a mall one is not
exposed to pamphleteers.  (Did anyone avoid some airports because of the

As I see it, the mall management should be allowed to expell people
who dicourage shoppers with their behavior.  I disagree that quiet,
well-dressed, unobtrusive pamphleteers are in this cathegory any more
than people handing-out restaurant ads.

First, people who don't like the leafletting are not likely to complain
about it.  (Who are they going to complain to?  And about what?)
And the owners of the mall have made the judgement that in general, shoppers
will not go to the mall as much if the leaflets are given out.  If the
owners are mistaken about this, their mistake will result in loss of money
by them, and eventually they will have to change their policy.
Yes, I am saying to trust the owners in their judgement of shopkeepers'
preferences--after all, if they're wrong, they'll feel it in their pocketbook.

It's quite possible customers might dislike advertising leaflets less than
they do political pamphlets.  As I have pointed out before, customers
may do things for illogical reasons, and this is not even that illogical,
since the customer preference is based upon the type of content of the
leaflets-- advertising vs. politics.

Not actually.  I _was_ hoping that you would say that you do not think that
the Communists should take over the world except for the US.  The reason I
exclude the US is that very few people in the US are willing to
say that they think the US should have a Marxist-Leninist form of government.
There is a group of people who seem to think that Communisim is fine for
the rest of the world. Try saying it Tim.  That's right, 
don't discuss McCarthyism (just exactly what is that, anyway?), just say
that you DON'T WANT THE COMMUNISTS TO WIN.  Try to keep criticisms of the 
US out of the paragraph in which you (hopefully) do this.  Once this is done
we can discuss what reasonable steps can be taken to prevent our little
red friends from 'building socialism"" all over the place.  Incidentally, 
my posting compared the possible penalties for trespassing to the penalties
for 'slandering the Soviet state'.  Of course, _criticising_ the US will not
get you put in jail at all, not even for ""short legally defined term"".
My understanding of the 'blacklisting' issue is that people were denied
employment on political grounds.  This is not the same as a prison term.
Also, can you think of any period of 'left-wing hysteria', or is it only 
right-wingers who are subject to this form of mental disturbance?

Unless you propose using tax money to pay for the support and maintenance
of the mall (rather than charging the stores rent), the stores and
the mall management (acting on behalf of the owner) are the only ones
who have a legitimate ""right"" to determine what can and cannot be done
in the mall.  In fact, when malls became a gathering place for teen-age
gangs, the police were called in to eject them, even though they were
not patronizing the store.
If Tim really wants to distribute leaflets on the mall, he can approach
a few of the merchants, show them what he wants to distribute, and
ask the merchant to bring it up at the next ""tenants meeting"".
Charities and non-profit organizations frequently do this, and are
given permission to leaflet for a specific period of time.  For example:
Easter Seals can have various fund raising events during the week or two
preceding the telethon.  Ecology groups and the forest service people are
invited during RV exibition week.
The main concern of mall management is control of any activity which
might be percieved by the tenants as driving customers away.  If
you can convince the tenants that your activities will ATTRACT
people to the mall, you might be able to get the whole mall for
a 'Theme exibit'.  Also, find out what the themes will be, and
who is running them.  You may be able to get a booth and distribute
leaflets from there.  From the original posting, it sounds like
you were ejected because you didn't go through channels.","DiIu60B-cU0J",18,1986-03-13,12,0

More likely, a church would allow someone to stay if either they participated
or they merely observed, i.e., they didn't disturb the service in any way.
Similarly, mall owners may allow people into the mall on the condition that
they don't disturb any of the (other) shoppers there.

that not constitute interference with the owner's intended uses.

A critical distinction, which you failed to mention, is that we are talking
about two different types of power, economic and political.  Economic power
is maintained in a free society by continuously pleasing consumers, while
political power is maintained in a non-free society by frightening the populace
into submission through violence and the threat thereof.  It is thus difficult
to imagine that our economic freedoms could lead to abuse of human rights,
while it seems that the abuse of human rights is necessary for the
maintenance of power by the communist party in the Soviet Union, at least
in the long term.

I fully agree that there are differences between types of property.
It is not much questioned that if you run a bissness on a property,
than you cannot limit access to it in an arbitrary way.  For example,
it is not legal to refuse leasing an appartment solely because the
applicant is black.  Access to a store cannot be limited in this fashion
as well.  
What is being proposed here is censorship by mall management (whatever the
form of this management is).  If driving customers away is a legitimate
concern, then simple rule concerning the behavior of leaflet distributors
would suffice.  I already ask why airports or downtown shopping alleys
can put up with them.  
Imagine that Tim is not a peacenik but a Trotskyist who wants to 
distribute his leaflets.  Do you think that many merchants would 
find it a cute idea to let him do it in the week around anniversary
of Trotsky's death?  Scary for shoppers?  Indeed, but why shoppers
in Cambridge Central Square do not avoid the stores?  If anything
makes peoples to go to a mall instead, it is prices, selection
and availability of parking.
The ancient democracies had to have the meeting places for the people,
be it Greek agora or Roman forum.  It seems that suburban communities
suffer a kind of agorafobia: a fear against a place where the most
of the public can meet freely.  Res publica, common wealth, turns into
a constellation of carefully insulated communities.  In this circumstances
I agree more with the decision of NJ courts, which view malls as
equivalent to public places than NY courts, which do not.

stated that there is always freedom of speech, regardless of 
access to public places like Malls, by using the electronic media.
If nothing else, according to the free market, one should simply
be able to *BUY* time on TV to present one's opinions.
Mobil Oil does it, Polluting Companies do it to prove they are
not polluting, so surely citizens concerned about population
control, preventing war and other issues should *at least*
be able to *BUY* time on TV to present their opinions.
 
Alas, this is *not* the case. Moreover the way in which requests
for *paid* time are turned down graphically illustrates media bias.
A report in the March 9, 1986 New York Times reveals this bias
quite clearly (p.56):
(quoted w.o. permission)
  ""The National Conservative Political Action Committee says it
   will spend $1.5 million on a campaign to sell Americans on aid
   to the rebels (sic) in Nicaragua.  The advertisements advance
   a kind of Central American domino theory with a 30-second spot
   depicting Mexican Communist terrorists(my note: the ""rebels""
   are of course, *not* ""terrorists"") sneaking across the border,
   each with the goal of murdering 10 Americans. (My note:
   plausible scenario eh?!!) Another conservative group, the
   National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, says it
   will spend $2 million on its ads, which assail the Sandinista
   Government of Nicaragua and suggest links to Libyan terrorists.
 
  ""Meanwhile, Neighbor to Neighbor, a San Francisco-based group,
   says it is having great difficulty buying air time for 
   ""Faces of War"", a 30-minute program that portrays conditions in
   Nicaragua and El Salvador and takes a strong stand against
   American support for the Nicaragua rebels (my note, once
   again we note that the NY Times has decided that the Contras
   are ""rebels"" while it is somehow obvious that ""Mexican Communists""
   depicted in right-wing ads are ""terrorists""-double think in action!)
  ""Nick Allen, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor, said more than
   100 television stations around the country had refused to sell
   air time to broadcast the program, whose host is Mike Farrell, the
   ""B.J."" of the old M*A*S*H television series.  Many stations,
   Mr. Allen said, called it too controversial or ""unbalanced""
  ""In Washington, four stations refused the program, he said, but a
   fifth, WTTG, Channel 5,is among about 30 around the country that
   accepted it and will show the program at 11:30 tonight.""
 
I find this sort of censorship and blatant bias contradicts claims
that (a)there is a ""liberal"" bias in the media (quite the opposite
is *indeed* the case)  (b) one can always *BUY* time to present
one's opinions.  Certainly a 30-minute program, while more in-depth,
is harder to put on.  But then again the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been among many groups denied
access even to 30-second spots on late-night TV.

   ""Although no one has made a reliable national survey on the matter
    a modest sampling suggests that groups producing programs supporting
    the policies of the Reagan Administration often have little
    difficulty in buying time.  John Fisher, chairman of the American
    Security Council, which makes the largest number of half-hour
    programs with a pro-defense viewpoint, said that the council placed
    ""Peace through Strength"" - a program aimed at alerting Americans
    about the dangers of ""peace through appeasement"" - on 174 stations
    in one week in September, 1984.
   ""According to Mr. Fisher, ""Peace through Strength"" and ""Crisis in the
    Americas"", a pro-Administration program on Central America, have each 
    been shown more than 900 times on television.  In many cases the
    programs were broadcast free by stations as public-service programs
    for which the council did not have to buy time, he said.

   ""Neighbor to Neighbor has filed a complaint with the FCC against KBHK-TV,
    San Francisco's Channel 44, charging a breach of the Fairness Doctrine
    (my note: Reagan's appointees to the FCC all support total elimination

    because of the station's refusal to sell time.  Mr Allen says that
    KBHK is usually willing to accept paid broadcasting and that the only
    prime-time coverage that Channel 44 has given to Central America
    in the last 12 months has been the pro-Administration opinions of

Now why should this be? Presumably the groups affected are willing to
pay enough for the time to compensate the TV station for their lost
revenue, including the effect on neighboring show's viewing share,
otherwise this is hardly a fair criticism. TV stations are generally owned
by corporations, so it's unlikely the owners have personal opinions that
lead to these refusals. If corporate management is acting against the
interests of the shareholders to suppress opinions *they* don't like, they
leave themselves open to lawsuites from infuriated shareholders.
This leaves two possibilities:
    - The TV stations think airing these programs will annoy their
      audiences and thus affect later revenues.
    - The TV stations think they may loose their licences or have
      other regulatory problems as a result of airing the shows.
The first *could* be a factor, but it seems unlikely to be major. Do
viewers of *Dallas* really care about what political opinions have been
aired on the station?
So my guess is that these problems stem from fear of government regulation.
The solution seems obvious, though I doubt Sevener would agree with it.

removed by the same agent, i.e., the government, whether in the mall

for him to be removed by displeased consumres.

I can't comment much on this, since I don't know the deatils of Marcos'

This is quite true.  Nonetheless, the mere existence of such policies

with property rights.

It is interesting that you introduce the term ""corporate feudalism"" with 
no elaboration as to what it means.  Is it such a well-known phrase that

Apparently, you and I differ in a fundamental way over just what a

As far as I'm concerned, the right of free speech is the right not to
be prevented from speaking, it is not the right to be supplied with a
microphone aor an auditorium at another's expense.  Nor is it the
right to be heard, i.e., the right to have an audience.

some 70% of newspapers endorsed Ronald Reagan - higher than the

The two articles I cited from the NYTimes showed that this bias
does not just show up in *endorsements* it also shows up quite
graphically in the refusal to even air *paid* ads by groups

Now this is a rather curious ""free market"".  I had always thought that
a free market meant that products or services should be offered to
all with the money to pay for them.  This is supposedly the glory of
the truly free market - as a merchant I will sell shoes to *anyone*
be they black or white, fascist, communist or atheist.  Now we find
groups with the money to pay for ads being turned down while other
groups are being provided similar time for free ""in the public interest"".

I didn't realize that selling any product or service in a free market
was dependent on ""looking favorably upon the message"".  Moreover it
is curious that TV stations had no qualms about placing cigarette
commercials on their stations - was it because they wished to promote
lung cancer rates?  I have seen numerous ads promoting nuclear
energy on different TV stations - do these TV stations have
a magic solution to the problems of nuclear wastes which lasts for
centuries?
Moreover isn't it interesting the *type* of bias this represents in
the supposedly ""liberal"" media?
I patiently await your documentation of a single case in which a
polluting company was refused paid advertising time.

Look around you, then.  Read newspapers and history books.
Just because 'economic' and 'political' have distinct definitions does
not mean 'economic power' and 'political power' are separate.  Mike did
not claim they were identical.
In an intelligent and well-informed society run by an honest government,
the two powers would be completely distinct.  But in our 'free' society,
the electorate is easily influenced by advertising, which costs money,
and members of the government can easily abuse its powers to gain personal
wealth.

Your definition of ""free speech"" would go over quite well with the
Communist Party of the USSR, the National Socialists of Germany,
P.W. Botha of South Africa, and all other dictators throughout the

I am sure that many people were blacklisted in the 1950's; it is not a made
up story.  I consider that a very unfortunate chapter in our history.  However,
it might be well to keep some perspective on what was going on in those days.
The Soviet Union was colonizing (and in the process murdering a lot of innocent
people) many countries that just wanted to be left alone (can any of us here 
in the U.S. really understand what Poland has gone through in the past 47
years?).  Many people, well meaning I am sure, did identify themselves with the
philosophy if not the government of the Soviet Union in the 1930's and 40's.
Some of them took an awfully long time to wake up to the reality that the 
Soviety Union represented brutality and repression.  
Also, it is bad enough to be blacklisted in a given industry, but another
thing to be blacklisted in a country that has only one employer; namely the
government.  I might also mention that there has been quite a bit of what
I would call McCarthyism on the left in this country.  Do you remember the
Carter cabinet member in 1980 who almost literally called Reagen a racist?
Reagen may lack a lot of good qualities (such as seeing reality), but he
is basically a man of decent motives.  I think branding him a racist is
leftwing McCarthyism.  That is not the only example I could mention, but
I will spare you.
The issue is freedom.  It is bad when one person unjustly represses the
freedom of another.  It is wrong when a government unjustly represses the
freedom (such as freedom to breathe) of its citizens.  But, imperfect as
it is, the United States, even at its worst, stands for values far more
humane and positive than the Soviet Union.  If we cannot agree on that
point, I fear we will not do well in competition with the Soviet Union.","djmq3l7T1FEJ",20,1986-03-27,-14,0

Apparently Radford, you have not studied the numerous cases in which
journalists in the media were summarily dismissed for expressing
views at variance with ""business interests"". TV stations understand
the unfortunate fact that the Military-Industrial Complex has
billions of dollars - Peace groups have scarcely any.  They are
so destitute the recent Great Peace March folded for lack of funds.
(as well, I suspect, due to poor management)
Sydney Schanberg was the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who
was depicted in the movie ""The Killing Fields"" for his reporting
on Cambodia.  He was just dismissed from the New York Times after
publishing a series of articles in opposition to the Times editorial
policies on housing and community issues.
John B Oakes *used* to be the senior editor of the New York Times:
he was a relative of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger the publisher of the
Times.  He was dismissed as editor of the Times after publishing
a series of editorials which infuriated the New York Times'
corporate board.  In exchange, he is allowed to write Op-Ed pieces
on a regular basis.
THIS is what happens at the ""liberal"" bastion of the New York Times.
*HOW* can TV stations suffer regulatory problems from airing paid
ads of Peace groups when they also air ads of pro-militarist
groups for absolutely nothing?
The real problem is that TV stations are frightened to death that their
corporate sponsors may reduce support if they allow an alternative
viewpoint to be placed on the air.  After all, the biggest American
corporations also stand to gain billions from Star Wars and
the nuclear arms buildup.
 
There are a number of books you can read for information on the media
and its corporate sponsors.  ""The Powers That Be"" by David Halberstam
is one that is highly recommended.  Another one is ""The Establishment""
by Leonard Silkwood.  There was also an excellent documentary on
Edward Murrow on HBO recently.  Hopefully, perhaps they will show it
again.
I continue to be amazed at the naivete of some people on this net!
And warmongers say those working for Peace are naive!!!!

like on your own property, and you have the right to acquire

to find one property owner -- anywhere -- who is willing to give

objection to people flaming at Meese if they want to.  But then Mr. Thau
goes on to issue a paragraph of what he must have known were flagrant lies,
in what has got to be one of the most intellectually dishonest statements
to go across the net since I've been reading it.
Strong language, I know.  But look at this.
Mr. Thau writes:

>Robert Thau
Mr. Thau here makes three claims, each of which is absolutely false, and
none of which is difficult to check.  He claims that:
	1.  In recent issues of National Review, William F. Buckley, Jr.
	    has opposed (Mr. Thau's phrase is ""inveighed against"") court
	    protection of the rights of homosexuals,
	2.  Buckley has editorialized against the Gramm-Rudman ""balance
	    the budget"" bill,
   and  3.  He ""seems blissfully unaware"" that a line-item veto would
	    require a constitutional amendment.
Now I generally read the National Review, pretty carefully.  When I saw Mr.
Thau's posting, I thought it was odd, because I didn't remember Buckley's
having written anything about Gramm-Rudman *or* homosexual rights.  So
I went and reread every word Buckley has written in National Review since
September.  In the last eight issues of the National Review, nowhere,
absolutely *NOWHERE*, does Buckley say the things Mr. Thau tries to make us
believe he said.
The *only* thing even vaguely related to homosexuality written by Buckley
in those eight issues is a short column on AIDS in school-age children,
in which he explicitly says he is *not* in favour of quarantine, and that
homosexuality should make *no difference* in how the law treats AIDS
victims.  There's not a word, anywhere, signed by Buckley or not,
advocating that homosexual's rights be curtailed, ignored, abridged, or
anything of the sort.  As far as I can tell, Mr. Thau simply made it all up.
As for Gramm-Rudman, National Review's only editorial mention of the bill
was in an *unsigned* editorial, which from the style I would guess was
written by Linda Bridges.  (Buckley's columns appear over his signature
in every issue.)  This unsigned editorial may well have been the source
of Mr. Thau's fantacizing about Buckley and Gramm-Rudman.  It indeed
opposes Gramm-Rudman, in part because its passage would hurt the prospects
for a line-item veto.  But not even this unsigned piece could possibly be
construed as being ""blissfully unaware"" of anything.
And Thau has the nerve to complain about ""hypocrisy"".  How about some
simple honesty?
Why would Mr. Thau make these things up?  It doesn't make much sense, I
know.  Aside from the fact that it's pretty dumb for *anyone* to indulge
in intellectual condescension toward William Buckley, didn't Mr. Thau
realize someone could check his charges?  Did he just get carried away
with, ah, creativity? Generally, if someone is caught faking citations
in a debate, he's immediately disqualified.  Of course, that rule can't
be enforced on the net, but I think people should be aware of the depths
to which some netters are willing to stoop to try to disparage people they
disagree with.
In any case, Mr. Thau owes us all an apology.  An explanation might be
entertaining, but it's unlikely to convince.

Interesting statistics, but given your title, ""Equality through
Reaganomics?"", it would be nice if you could provide us with a
clue as to which of this administration's policies might be credited
with bringing about this state of affairs.  ""Post hoc, ergo propter

and there are social and economic forces at play that are quite
orthogonal to the goals of this administration.

If it is indeed true, as I have read in various articles summarizing
studies done on this question, that
1)well-paid factory jobs are declining  (this is *undoubtedly* true)
2)the major increase in jobs has been in low-paid service jobs
 
Then it only makes sense that 65% of new jobs have gone to women.
As the husband gets laid off from his $20-30k factory job, the
wife is increasingly forced to go out and work at McDonald's
or anywhere she can get a job.  Since she has probably been out of
the labor force for years low-paid service jobs are what she will
probably get. 
 
This would seem another deceptive use of statistics by the right-wing
similar to their attempt to try to make it look as if the country
is going broke aiding the poor by lumping Social Security in with
welfare programs.  Note it says ""65% of all the wage and salary growth
has gone to women"".  The phrasing of this makes it sound as if
women are getting more raises than men.  I don't think that's
what it really measures but rather simply totals all increased
wages and salaries from new jobs combined with any raises.
If this  is true then of course if women are getting most of the new
McDonald's type jobs then they will also get most of the
wage and salary growth.  But *how much*?  If women were getting
new jobs comparable to those of men then they should get *at least*
the same increase in wage and salary growth as their increase in jobs.
They are not: instead women are getting 78% of the new jobs predominately
in low-paid service positions but only 65% of increased pay.
 
If it is indeed true that most of the new jobs are low-skilled and
lowpaid service jobs, and these are taken mostly by women then
this explains why women are not getting the share of increased
total wages one would expect if they were getting new jobs
equivalent to men.

I have already pointed out that in fact this indicates the new jobs
women are getting are *not* as well-paid as men.
But this is really a poor measure overall which tells us almost
nothing.  The questions to be asked in comparing women to men
and whether they are truly achieving equality are:
1)what are the median incomes for men vs. women?
  unfortunately it still remains true that women earn 65% of
  what men earn.  This statistic has not changed to my knowledge
  during the entire Reagan administration.
  (at least it hasn't gotten worse as have the poverty rate,
   unemployment rate, income inequality, trade deficits,
   savings rate,etc ad nauseum..............................)
2)out of the new jobs created how many well-paid professional
  jobs were filled by women?  Has women's representation in
  professional jobs like medicine, law, engineering, science,
  etc. appreciably increased?  I believe they have increased
  slightly, regardless of Reagan's attacks on affirmative action.
 
The statistics cited by National Review are both deceptive
and irrelevant.  But that is hardly surprising for National Review.
Nor for the Detroit News and the media in general.

Of course there are other factors involved than govt  policy,  so

You are joking, of course, but there *are* a lot of people who
think that someone who gets a job (a woman, immigrant or whatever)
*takes* the job from others. On the contrary, anyone who holds
a productive job *makes* jobs for others. Thus, the more jobs

Fortunately, others have adequately rebutted the original ""conclusion"", and
their rebuttals serve equally well for this one.  Though of course you still
provide no reasoning.

Sorry, but your argument wasn't even complete enough to be of the fallacious
form ""correlation implies cause"".  Because you didn't establish that your
statistics had anything to do with equality (as other rebuttals have shown.)
Without a base of reference, you might just as well be saying that women
are getting further ahead of men, which certainly wouldn't be equality.
But I don't want to put words in your mouth.  (They'd hardly fit past your
feet.... :-)

Gosh, I guess it's my turn now to dispell your impression that I dislike
everything the present administration does.  I can list a few things too:
Supreme Court Justice O'Conner, (it's getting harder to think of anything
else...) firing Burford and Watt, keeping Bush silent, embarrasing itself, etc.

I understand how creating new jobs leads to creating other new jobs,
but just how does forcing one person out of a job due to availability
of cheaper labor create new jobs?  The current policy seems to be to
create conditions of extreme poverty and then lower the minimum wage for
minors.  The economic conditions force the minors to seek work instead
of attend school; the differential on wages gives them a competitive
advantage for *existing* jobs, lowering the cost to the employer and forcing
the higher-paid adult out of work.  Since labor is inelastic (something
conveniently ignored by free market freaks), the adult ends up unemployed,
his children drop out of school to go to work ...
Now in the case of immigrants, many of the jobs they take are so bad
no one else would take them anyway.

Obvious that it was your conclusion, perhaps.  An obvious conclusion from
the quote, hardly.  I love this ""may be"".  It is a true statement.
So would ""may not be"".  In books like ""Chariot of the Gods"" or
""Devil's Triangle"" you find lots of lines like ""Perhaps we have been
visited by aliens with powerful technologies."" or ""Is it possible
that there is a force here beyond the current understanding of science?"".
I forget the name of this little rhetorical technique, but the intent

Inductive conjecture?  Have you ever heard the term ""intellectual honesty""?
Don't you think your inductive process would be a bit more valid if it took
into account, just for instance, the increase in the percentage of jobs that
are in the service sector and the percentage of such jobs that are held by
women?

Like in the ""Is it possible ...?"" case that is ignored by small minds

post notes with conscious rhetorical fallacies?

You *must* be kidding.  You post something that occurred during the
Reagan administration, with a ""conjectured"" but totally unjustified
(by you or the quote) implication that a specific policy not only
was responsible, but was better than another policy which wasn't
even treated by the data (affirmative action is still in effect
despite Meese's attempts to dismantle it, and you offered no data
indicating the change in the number of women in the workplace since a.a.
went into effect).  So Mike responds with a couple of his own
(dead servicemen and DoD waste), also unsupported and arguably p.h.e.p.h.
You don't see a valid connection?  You want put your *method* of
presentation of information out of bounds of discussion?  No
dice.  You said elsewhere that you agree with the principle that
your conclusion, even if correct, is not trustworthy if it wasn't
reached through impartial analysis.  So put it into practice.
Intellectual honesty.  Think about it.

I always have trouble with statements like the above concerning 
how much women make compared to men. It seems to me that the 65% 
figure quoted cannot be representative of the *current* situation.
A far more useful number, in my opinion, would be the earnings ratio
of women to men for those people who have entered the workforce in the
last five or so years. This would provide a much better ""snapshot"" of
what is going on then a number that includes women who grew up in an
era when females were not only expected to perform only menial type
work but were also often barred from various (high paying) professions.
So how about it? Does anyone have said figure, or something close? 
I've never seen anything other than the all inclusive and somewhat
misleading 65% number. The only reason I can think of for this  is
that this ratio would be higher (perhaps significantly so) than 65%
and thus would not make as good a rallying point. 
[I imagine that the next thing I'll be reading is that the solution
for this problem is anti-market place comparable worth legislation.]

Glad to; I thought it was obvious. My apologies. *Business deregu-

Of course there are other factors involved than govt  policy,  so
the  conclusion  is merely an inductive conjecture. That is why I
added the (?).  But if you wished to accuse me of a logical  fal-
lacy, it should've been ""post hoc, ergo propter hoc"", rather than
""non-sequitur"".
Instead, you chose to interpret my note as a blanket  endorsement
of  the  present administration. To dispel that impression (and I
really should not have to) let me list a few areas where I disap-
prove  of  its  policies:  MX  ;  abortion; death penalty; school
prayer; revival of detente; choice of welfare cuts;  incoherent
mixture  of  monetarism  and  supply-side'ism; indiscriminate DoD
funding; empty rhetoric on terrorism. I  could  name  many more.
Now please re-read your response calmly - and I know you can be
logical when you try. What do GI casualties have to do with
the text *or* the title of my note ? Watch that knee, Mike:
it jerked in mid-word! Right between Reagan- and -omics.

I addressed them to the large minds, to give them something  that

enough to *change their mind* once in a while. Better still,
the discussion might help me change *mine* . Economists were the

The newspapers write that the administration  has  been  dragging

tration claims to be scrapping regulations by the bushel,  and  I
believe  (perhaps erroneously) there is some core of truth in it.

*prevented*  the  gains  in equality. I think this is interesting
and worth consideration. I offer the facts *for* consideration.

I think you've got hold of the wrong end of the stick, here.  You might
ask of the first part of a surgical procedure: ""How does cutting
people open cure them?""
The ""availability of cheaper labor"" means that there are people willing
to do the work for less.  Typically it means that the ""cheaper labor""
folks are POORER than the fellow who has the job already.  
So you offer the person who has the job a lower wage -- he refuses,
he ""needs"" the salary he had.  (This process can be VERY indirect --
the folks in Michigan, with a per-capita income of $11,466,
can lose fleet contracts to the folks in Japan with a per-capita
income of $9,864).
You then offer it to the ""cheaper labor"", who accepts (You offer it
first to the people you've been dealing with because that's smart
business).  The ""cheaper  labor"" is not some subhumanoid hive-oriented
creature who may be safely regarded as more compliant, or less
deserving -- he (or she) is a human being, perhaps living in a poorer
country, perhaps the victim of prejudice, perhaps simply less-skilled
(though sufficiently skilled that he/she is useful to you).
Is it so horrible that the free market in this case tends to distribute
money among the downtrodden and away from those who refuse to compete?
>The current policy seems to be to
>create conditions of extreme poverty and then lower the minimum wage for
>minors.  
That's quite a remarkable statement.  Where can I find the
organization doing this?  Lowering or getting rid of the minimum wage
WOULD be a good idea -- before the imposition of the minimum wage,
black youth unemployment was about the same as white youth
unemployment.  I assume that whoever is administering this ""policy"" is
not couching it in terms of ""creating conditions of extreme poverty""
-- what do they (whoever ""they"" are) actually say about it?
>The economic conditions force the minors to seek work instead
>of attend school; the differential on wages gives them a competitive
>advantage for *existing* jobs, lowering the cost to the employer and forcing
>the higher-paid adult out of work.  
Quite a simplistic analysis, this.  I assume that this is backed up
with some statistics, somewhere?  In particular it seems to imply that
the role of skill and experience can be neglected.  In some jobs this
is true -- some assembly-line work, for example.  In other jobs (heavy
equipment operation, carpentry) this is not true.
>Since labor is inelastic (something
>conveniently ignored by free market freaks), the adult ends up unemployed,
>his children drop out of school to go to work ...
Once you're an ""official adult"", then it's nasty of Jim@ism780 to tell
you that you can't have a job because Jim wants to keep employed
somebody making (say) twice your anticipated wage, and until you're
that age, you're pretty heavily under the thumb of your parents, at
least as far as getting a real job goes.
Labor inelastic (in supply)?  Somewhat, certainly, but do you have any
figures?  If labor WERE very inelastic in supply, then we would NOT see a
change in high-school students' behavior because of a change in wages.
Further, the person in the high bracket (whose job is about to be
destroyed unless he takes a pay cut) would then not even consider
refusing the lower salary -- it would be madness.
Or perhaps you mean ""inelastic in demand""?  This would imply that
jobs are NOT created in response to offers to take jobs for lower
wages, nor destroyed in the face of demands for higher wages.  But
this propensity for detroying jobs in the face of demands for
continued high wages would seem to be what you're complaining about,
so I doubt you mean ""inelastic in demand"".
Besides, it would imply that no jobs were destroyed by the imposition
of minimum wage.  How many elevator operators, shop girls,
lamplighters, butlers, and maids, do you see around these days?
>Now in the case of immigrants, many of the jobs they take are so bad
>no one else would take them anyway.
Besides being more than a little insulting to the immigrants involved,
this contradicts your earlier assertion that labor is ""not elastic"".  
because clearly if a job that ""nobody else would take"" will be taken
anyhow, then the supply of labor is elastic so long as people can
immigrate.","ChtyftyklqUJ",13,1985-11-25,-28,19

You are rewriting history. Just look at the quote above. I gave you FACT,
no conclusion. Food for thought. As a public service. You ASKED for my   
conclusion. I gave it to you: the ""original"" and only.
(On the rebuttals, see below).

>Without a base of reference, you might just as well be saying that women

Right you are: *if* women were *ahead*  of  men,  the  statistics
would  show  they are getting *further* ahead, and it wouldn't be
equality. Facts being what they are, statistics  show  what  they
do. Base of reference is all around you.
Now, for the rebuttals. I assume you mean two notes by Tim Sevener's, as
the others I read consist of silly ad hominem flames. They con-
tain some nice analysis. However,  it does not rebut. Con-
sider Tim's typical case: a man lost a 20K job at a plant, a wom-
an has to take a 10K job at McDonald's.  Certainly  *bad*  -  but
even  then,  there  would  be *leveling* of the sexes - it would
just be leveling *down*. 
Whether the case is really typical for today's economy,  is  much
under discussion on the net. But it is a different question.
The best feature of Tim's analysis is that he has posed some relevant
*questions* . Some conceivable answers to them *would* refute the 
above conclusion; others would *confirm* it. In either case, facts,
not flames, and logic, not ideology, are required.

You said it was an obvious reasoned conclusion.  You didn't give
""may not be"" the same status.  How about providing some analysis
that shows how the data supports the conclusion?  My whole point
is that you are ""leading the witness"" by suggesting plausible
explanations without supporting them, just as Von Daniken does,
which is why I mentioned ""Chariots of the Gods"".

Pardon me, but I have an informed opinion about your intent.
Now, since I have been talking about your mode of presentation,
not about the facts presented, where does your guess come from?
I have no fear of the fact.  I have no fear of conclusions reached from
it through logic.  But I despise dishonest rhetoric.  I will take no
legal action to stop same, nor will I encourage the filtering out
of your comments, nor anything else that constitutes censorship,
which I oppose.  But I will continue to call a spade a spade.
Others can draw their own opinions.

Getting pretty hostile, eh?  Can't take a little criticism, eh?
I suspect we both do a bit of enlightening as well as obfuscating
and controlling.  In my life I have been known more for the former
than the latter. I do wish you luck, in learning to challenge
your own preconceptions as well as all other aspects of quality
of life that people deserve.  I share your wish that I do not
succeed in any sort of suppression.  If you think that strong
expressions of disagreement are suppression, then you don't know
what the word means.  As for control, I wish to exert some
control over my own life and fate, but I have steadfastly avoided
the means of control over others.  Again, I'm not sure you know
what the word means.  As for direction, we can all use some.
I hope neither of us is successful in *mis*direction.

My idea of large minds includes avoiding statements and attributions of
intent (and other such fallacious meta-subjects and red-herrings), and
sticking to the basic subjects of the debate.  We all make those mistakes

GOD FORBID (er... just between us atheists).
But if science does that, we may do well to emulate her.
Posing a question for discussion may produce better (or at  least
different) results than simply giving your answer for others to 
refute or agree. A couple of good substantive points have already
been made on both sides with respect to my (?) title. (BTW: does the
preceding imply - *because* I ended it with with (?) ? Who cares?)
I didn't stick in that ""science"" quote to prove anything,  but
simply  because  I  like  it, as a kind of epigraph. The quote is
probably inexact. It's from Karl Popper, but I couldn't place it.

Guilty as charged. Flames breed flames;  attributions  of  intent
are among the worst kind. Inquiries about individuals' ""intellec-
tual honesty"" are of the same kind. A *meta-subject* - about what
stuff  is proper to post, or to object to - was, I think, a legi-
timate (if boring) new subject of debate - if only it was treated
calmly.  I  just  posted  a  note  on ""What is Fit to Print"". Any

This denies all institutional aspects of market dynamics.  I suggest you read
some Thorstein Veblen.  I am not going to go into a lengthy debate here about
the realities of free markets; I would just like to point out that economists
much better educated in the intricacies than either you or I have argued
against this view.  After Veblen and Joan Robinson Classicism was
widely considered refuted; it is now back in vogue, more, I would argue, for
political reasons than those of theory.

This was hypothetical; it was rather shoddy of me not to make that clear.
And I was speaking of the move toward service sector jobs and the widespread
trend for formerly skilled jobs to become clerical due to the lower skill
required due to automation.

In areas where there is great labor competition there is little competition
among employers in regard to salary.  Without minumum wage or
union-established wages (which are not ""artificial"" laws affecting a
""natural"" market since all market behavior is subject to human laws,
especially the laws of property), if a service sector employer lowers wages
the employee cannot simply shop around for a higher wage.  When the supply of
labor is high relative to the demand, wages drop.  But one cannot simply
switch to a higher-paying field.  The way our society is structured, we have
ignorant or unskilled people without that flexibility.  We can let them reach
poverty levels when the evolution of the markets select against them, but
there is a high societal cost.  It means increased crime, disease, and
suffering; the former two clearly hurt all of us (even libertarians :-).
And if the working force dies off due to ""natural selection"" and then the
environmental factors change again their unavailibility could adversely
affect the rest of us.

I would argue (without figures, sorry; but I don't notice too many economic
arguments made with figures) that labor is VERY inelastic *in some ways*.
You have only shown that it is not *totally* inelastic.  The inelasticity
comes from restricted skill or other requirements limiting the jobs a person
is able to take, the costs associated with changing jobs due to search time,
overhead, and especially need to relocate, and the limited understanding that
flexibility is possible (meta-skill, if you wish; again, we can allow such
people to suffer the consequences, but it still is an inelasticity).

It isn't what I am talking about, but again you indulge in a logical fallacy.
The correct implication would be that jobs are NOT *ALWAYS* created ....
There is a *range* of inelasticity.
>Besides, it would imply that no jobs were destroyed by the imposition
>of minimum wage.  How many elevator operators, shop girls,
>lamplighters, butlers, and maids, do you see around these days?
Again, it would not imply any such thing, since the term is not absolute.
But I am interested in your demonstration that the loss of those jobs was
due to the imposition of minimum wage, either in whole or in part.

I was talking specifically about immigrants from below the Rio Grande.
I'm not sure it is insulting if it reflects their desperation, the inability
of illegals to take arbitrary jobs, and the dismal conditions that they have
taken for granted all their lives.  People's expectations are not to be
discounted.  Here in California, the blue collar workers often blame the
immigrants for taking their jobs, and the ""you wouldn't take ours"" argument
is often proffered by the immigrants themselves.
And again you are treating elasticity as a two-state phenomenon.
I should have said ""labor is not perfectly elastic"" instead of ""labor is
inelastic""; sorry.  Of course immigration is a form of elasticity, but people
whose spines are not already bent from stooping in the fields and who do not
know how to live 12 in a room on beans and tortillas and who cannot go back
to Mexico at the end of the harvest season incur a very high cost in taking
such jobs, reflecting inelasticity.  One of the consequences of the current
economic structure is that employers do not provide toilets for farmworkers,
and then complain that farmworkers are ""unsanitary"".  I'm not sure how
a totally unregulated marketplace would alleviate that.
The basis for economic structure is politics; regardless of what is
""natural"", people will attempt to change the environment in the ways that
appear to satisfy their desires, and that will necessarily lead to group
action.  This is why anarchy, libertarianism, and free markets can at best be
temporary phenomena.  We started out as anarchists, and then we evolved.  An
anarchic society is like the primeval soup: elements group forming cells and
then larger organisms with increasing ability to respond in varied ways to
their environment.  When you develop organisms with enough control over their
environments and enough awareness of how to achieve their ends and when the
desired ends go beyond mere survival, you get concentration of power and
feudalism.  Since power cannot be totally centralized, you get subgroups
which eventually become strong enough to challenge the central authority.
Eventually you get a fairly stable fluctuation between centralization and
localization of power.  The whole process gets warped by counter-selfish
behavior like loyalty, nationality, and the like.  If the central authority
is able to actually control mental behavior (via wires, drugs, propaganda and
conditioning, coercive telepathy (Larry Niven's Thrintun), and the like) then
it can get severely warped in the centralization direction without the
central authority even risking loss of loyalty among armed enforcers.
So you see, you will never have a perfect free market system because there
will always be brain-damaged people like me who do not think it is in their
best interests, and we'll form nasty coops with ugly tariffs and pervert your
lovely pure system.
(For a fictional counterexample, read David R. Bunch's _Moderan_, with
robotized individuals (with ""flesh strips"" which retain their humanity)
living in individual robotized Strongholds.)

I thought you were the one who likes to break taboos?  One of the favorite
taboos I like to broach is discussion of the internal consistency of people's
statements and of the processes that lead to disagreement, which include
differing use of language, fallacy, and conscious or unconscious lying.  It
is my firm belief that a major reason Ronald Reagan has that ""teflon sticker""
is because it is taboo in our media to call someone a liar, even if there is
firm evidence.  Of course, libel laws are not complete protection, which
partially explains the ban.  But I really believe that demanding honesty
increases honesty since even the demander, once making the demand, will be
held up to his own standard.  You may totally disagree with me, but you
should not criticize me too harshly for breaking taboos that I believe it is
preferable to break.  However, I have toned down a bit with the awareness
that this taboo is being strongly defended.  So implicit censorship has once
again taken hold.

Does the statement ""Water tends to run downhill"", ""deny"" the existence of
pumps and siphons?  No.  I do not argue here that classical microeconomics
is ""the truth"", merely that some of its conclusions remain true.  Among
these conclusions (or are they postulates?) is the notion that one will
(where one can) buy cheap and sell dear.  If this is not what they still
teach in business school, please tell us all about it!

But Jim!  I'm only somewhat interested in your statement about minimum
wage -- I'm MUCH more fascinated to learn which government agency has
set off to create poverty, and perhaps, what those agencies call their
activities.

Oh please!  Let's avoid the question of what is ""natural""!  As a
matter of approximate definition in this context, ""artificial""
involves things imposed from outside the system of economic trade and
physical laws, and ""natural"" involves those conditions reached without
""artificial"" restraint or stimulus.  A natural market reaction to
flooding is one thing (food goes up, insurance stocks go down).  An
artificial stimulus to food prices (people are taxed and the tax money
used to buy food, raising its price) is another.  I absolutely concede
that the imposition of property laws by a government is ""artificial"",
similarly that injunctions against force or fraud are also artificial.
I don't argue that ONLY ""natural"" forces should be allowed to operate,
merely that unnatural ones should be applied with the greatest care.
Your mileage may differ :-) -- what other folks regard as ""natural"" and
unnatural is interesting, but not all that important to the question of 
what to do in a given situation.

I'd be very surprised if the market for unskilled labor was so very
inelastic in supply as that of, say, carpenters.  If you need a
ditch-digger, or a field hand, it takes a few minutes to show someone
what to do.  It doesn't matter whether the person was a farm laborer,
a hobo, or a doctor -- the basics of unskilled labor are very easy to
get across, even if you don't speak the language.  This means that
essentially all the cost of changing jobs in unskilled labor is the
cost of moving around (they aren't called ""migrant farm workers""
because they can't move around, by the way), and the
harder-to-evaluate cost of hearing about and deciding to take an
alternative job.  This is not ""nice"".  This is not ""good"".  This is
not what I would  like, but it DOES mean that there's relatively easy
movement between unskilled jobs, which means in turn that aggregate
demand for unskilled labor must go down before we have the spectacle
of a fieldhand unwilling or unable to take a job as a ditchdigger when
that of a  ditchdigger is the same amount of work and pays more
besides.  If you're worried about computer programmers being unable
to become librarians, then we're talking retraining.  If you're
worried about fieldhands becoming ditchdiggers, we're talking about
moving.  I don't argue this is EASY for farmworkers (I concede  a
certain amount of inelasticity) but I don't see it as the obstacle in
TIME that retraining is.

It is you who made the bald statement ""Since labor is inelastic...."".
and stated that this was ignored by free market types.  I think the
two statments are both false.  Labor is SOMEWHAT inelastic, but there are
things less elastic than labor (the supply of art by Da Vinci, and the
supply of orbital vehicles, to name two very extreme examples, (yes,
I could come up with less extreme examples, but since the discussion is
non-quantitative, I'm avoiding a side argument by not doing so)).

No argument there -- except that you're ignoring compensatory factors
like people who have more than one skill, entry of new people into the
market, and the presence of substitutes for labor. (Labor demand
is more elastic if one can replace a particular sort of laborer with 
a particular sort of machine).  Another point to make is that any 
alternative involving artificial support of an industry hides the advantages
of having different skills from people who might want them.

Quite correct.  My mistake to have taken from your statement that
labor was inelastic the implication that you thought labor was
inelastic.  I should have phrased it a little differently.  Of course,
to the extent labor demand IS inelastic, jobs are NOT created or
destroyed in response to the fluctuating supply of laborers.

I suggest then you take a look at ""Minimum Wage, Maximum Folly"" in 
Walter Williams' ""The State Against Blacks"", in which he talks about another
set of low-paying jobs.  Also, try Milton Friedman's ""Free to Choose""
pages 226-228, and ""The Unheavenly City Revisited"" by Banfield, pp 107-108.
Finally, Benjamin Page, in ""Who Gets What From Government"" has this to say:
	The minimum wage, for example, is supposedly designed to
	ensure a decent wage level for all workers by forbidding any
	wage payments below a certain hourly rate.  But those hoping
	for an egalitarian result fail to take account of how
	employers respond to the minimum wage: they simply refuse to
	hire anyone who cannot produce more than the minimum wage's
	worth of work.  Those who have jobs get paid the minimum, but
	many other jobs are abolished.  Unemployment in certain
	industries (e.g., retail trade) and among those with low skill
	levels (e.g., many black teenagers) rises alarmingly. [pp. 170]

And of course, I never claimed, (nor did any free-market advocate I
know of make the claim) that the labor market (or any market, for that
matter)  is perfectly elastic.  Let's avoid one-sided emotional
overtones here -- inelasticity in supply doesn't always mean bending
your spine and giving up your native land.  It can also be reflected
in going to medical school, or joining a trade union.

Perhaps by making it profitable to do so.  Right now, if you're an
uneducated illegal immigrant, not currently capable of producing a
minimum wage value (hence, you are employed doing piecework or
employed illegally), your job-path upward is more than a little restricted.  If
there were no such thing as an illegal immigrant (because immigration
was free), and no such thing as ""minimum wage"" there'd presumably be
fewer artificial ""chokes"" on  (say) registering for courses, getting a
government job, joining the US Army, registering for various aid
programs, getting jobs as lamplighters, shopgirls, elevator operators,
movie ushers, butlers, maids, cooks, (and, hell, let's throw out
licensure) hairdressers and social workers.
I specifically do NOT hope that this would provide a toilet in whatever
place you saw that lacked one.  Nope -- in a free society, you're free to
be a son-of-a-bitch.  On the other hand, you're also no longer one of the
very few places immigrants from south of the Rio Grande could work -- and
why work for a son-of-a-bitch when they can work for pussycats?  
I can't (and won't try to) argue that a free economy eliminates the wretched:
it merely provides them the widest range of opportunity.  So what to do
about the toilet problem?  Well, we could REQUIRE toilets, but,
as Milton Friedman points out in a 7/27/70 Newsweek column, that isn't
necessarily the way to help the farm workers:
	A recent Wall Street Journal story gives a striking example--
	the effects in Michigan of stricter federal and state
	standards for housing migrant farm workers.  The intent: to
	improve the conditions of a group of low-paid workers.  The
	result: to hurt the workers, the farmers, and consumers.
	""Higher labor costs,"" says the story, ""have prompted many
	growers ... to switch to mechanized havesting in recent years,
	lessening demand for migrant workers.  That trend has been
	intensified in the last two years as government agencies have
	implemented stricter housing regulations for growers
	participating in their migrant-worker placement programs....
	""State and federal officials estimate that mechanization could
	eliminate from 6000 to 10,000 jobs in Michigan this summer
	that were previously done by migrants.... License applications
	[for migrant camps] are down 11 percent so far this summer....
	""Nonetheless, approximately 50,000 migrant workers, mostly
	Mexican-Americans from Southwest Texas, are expected to come
	into Michigan looking for work this summer.  That's about the
	same number as came through last year.""
	Mechanization is a good thing if it is a response to a decline
	in the number of persons seeking jobs as migrant workers at
	low wages.  That would mean that the former migrant workers
	have found better employment opportunities.  Mechanization is
	a bad thing if it is a response to higher labor costs imposed
	arbitrarily from the outside.  That simply wastes capital to
	replace people who are forced into unemployment or even less
	desirable jobs.
	*Migrant workers* are clearly hurt.  It is small comfort to an
	unemployed migrant worker to know that, if he could get a job,
	he would have better housing.  True, the housing formerly
	available may have been most unsatisfactory by our standards.
	However, the migrant workers clearly regarded it, plus the
	accompanying jobs, as the best alternative available to them,
	else why did they flock to Michigan?  It is certainly
	desirable that they have better alternatives available to
	them, but until they do, how are they helped by eliminating
	alternatives, however unsatisfactory, that are now available?
	That is simply biting off their noses to save our faces.

Such as theft?  I don't think that we'll ever be rid of it, but to
argue that BECAUSE we'll never be rid of it, it should be SANCTIONED
*would* be a mistake.  Similarly, to argue that politics is always
with us, and THEREFORE we must have a dynamic, expanding,
allowed-to-meddle government *would* also be a mistake.  
By the way, history abounds with examples of trade without government
(trade between nations) and government without trade (communes, families).
Neither is the ""basis"" for the other -- rather the pursuit of goals
is the basis of both.
To argue that
the basis for economic structure is politics is to argue that the basis
for water structure is the riverbed.  I think the comparison is apt. 
A riverbed may lead a river among alternatives, but it can't lead it uphill,
it can't prevent the river freezing over, and it can't prevent it from
drying out.  Similarly, you may use political means to affect the market,
but not to cause it provide ""free lunches"",  not to suspend the laws
of supply and demand.

Huh?  This doesn't fit in very well with what I've heard of primate 
evolution, or are you going back to non-social creatures altogether?
The stability of a libertarian society is of course a matter of debate.
By some standards, the US is a libertarian society (less so nowadays)
and it has lasted 200 years.  There have, as Murray Rothbard points out, been 
quasi-libertarian societies in the past that have lasted for some time.
Another discussion, another time, I think -- but 
(and here we come to the promised comment) to simply state that 
politics is a useful way of garnering power and therefore no non-political
system will be able to withstand it is to underestimate the tolerance of a 
libertarian society for (say) local governments, and to overestimate the 
power of politics.

Now, Jim!  I suspect you of deliberately baiting me!  Do you recall my asking
for a ""perfect"" free market?  No?  Perhaps you recall my saying (many times)
that ""Utopia is not an option""?  You are, of course, WELCOME to form coops
and live communally in any society where I find myself dictator.  You'd
even be free to have tariffs among people who've agreed to this.  No sweat.
You'll lose by it, of course.  The people in the agreement will have to
pay more than the folks outside it.  Correspondingly, the people inside
the agreement will be able to internalize externalities in ways not open
to non-members (members would be able to correctly handle a free-rider
situation involving only themselves).
I object to none of this, provided that you initiate neither force nor
fraud against those who didn't sign your agreement.

Whoa!  You're arguing that supporting the overthrow of a ""sovereign"" nation
should not be lightly undertaken, and claiming that the alternative, leaving
it unmolested, should require less evidence.  I'm pointing out that 
you MIGHT be doing the sort of thing you dislike in another context.  Were
this a private conversation, I probably wouldn't have brought it up, but since
you're not the only one reading this, it seems worthwhile to bring the
reader's position into it too.  How many readers who vote for taxation
are aware they've taken a stand?

If you state it as a fact that it *is* universal behavior, I'll assume that
it is also *your* behavior, in which case my ""sauce for the goose"" argument

If I misunderstand you, please say so.

I have NOT heard you argue for taxes.  Of course, IF you have voted for them,
you have advocated them (unless you think that one shouldn't vote one's
conscience, or that folks are not impressed by the vote).  Only you know,
so far, whether you have voted for them.

Indeed.  To vote FOR a tax issue involves the consequence that one has
put an iota more power behind the state's power to tax.  Is this the
same as ""advocacy""?  It's certainly highly stylized, but it seems to
me that it is.  If you mean to draw a purely artificial distinction
between what you express on a ballot, and what you express in prose,
that's fine by me, but both are listened to, both are taken to
represent your opinion, and VOTES affect law.
>I asked why you would have me argue against taxation, and you did not answer
>that, unless your claim is that not voting for taxation is the same as
>arguing against it, a strange claim but one you seem to be making.
Oooh!  I hate this!  You said:
	>Why would you want me to argue against taxes when you don't
	>think I have enough information to argue for them?
AND IN DIRECT RESPONSE, I said:
	Because if your point is that if you don't know enough you
	shouldn't support positions, then it seems to me to be only
	consistent to agree that if you don't know enough you
	shouldn't vote for taxation.
To say it again, Jim, if your point about Jan's position about Nicaragua
is that he doesn't have enough information to advocate the overthrow
of a sovereign state, and he therefore shouldn't take such positions,
then it surely also applies to OTHER situations where ANYONE forms an
opinion on what they feel is enough information.  In particular, lots
of folks vote FOR (say) school levies.  To do so enhances the power of
the state to tax, and the polls are widely used as an opinion-indicator.
To vote FOR a school levy is thus to put oneself in the camp of those who
wish to increase taxes (for whatever  reason one thinks sufficient).
It is also a measure of support to those who would take a little more of
one's paycheck to put under government control.  Is this to be done 
WITHOUT STRINGENTLY SUFFICIENT INFORMATION?  Hell no!  And yet folks
do it all the time.  To claim that Jan didn't check carefully enough
before suggesting a view on netnews (which, after all, the state cannot
use as authority for anything) and to accuse him of intellectual dishonesty
because the facts look different to you strike me as a pair of rather
overblown responses.  As an instrument in showing you just HOW overblown,
I've invoked the POSSIBILITY that you've voted for issues  important
to other folks as Nicaragua is to you.  My claim is not that
""not voting for taxation is the same as arguing against it"", but rather that
voting for taxation is an act of the same sort as advocating it.
My GUESS is that you have voted for taxation at some point (most voters
have, I suppose), but the point stands even if you personally have never
done so -- intellectual dishonesty is quite a different thing from 
intellectual completeness.

Ho hum.  If the state were some sort of magical entity, this would be true,
but it's not.  The only worthwhile means I've heard of for judging a state
is by the fate of the individuals in its power.  At least some Nicaraguans
don't like their state.  If people in the US agree with them, perhaps they
should be free to help them.  If they disagree, perhaps they should be
free to donate time to the Sandinista government.  Right now, explicit
foreign aid by individuals is prohibited by the Logan act (probably
by several others too).  My reaction to this sort of controversy is that
the Logan act should be repealed, and people should be free to 
send their money to the Contras, the Sandinistas, or to Joe Bob, based
on the information the individuals consider sufficient.

Well -- in the US a bunch of votes is sufficient to topple one foreign
policy and put in another.  Advocacy on netnews is NOT, no matter how
heated or well-informed.  In short, a vote is a more dire sort of advocacy,
the kind the authorities back up with guns and paycheck withholding than,
advocacy within netnews.

A very good point.  The logic of the argument  holds regardless of the
conduct of the arguer.  My point is that you've over-reacted (impolitely)
to Jan's stuff (of course, I'm not polite, always, myself), and your
rhetoric is made suspect by demanding that his advocacy must pass 
a severer test than yours (he must talk about degradation and death in 
HIS proposal for what to do in re Nicaragua, but you don't have to).

I get it.  Does it count that Jan only suggested ""aid"" to the contras,
which (after all) only turns into explosions ""rather indirectly""?

Given that the Japanese attacked in 1941, and the relocation occurred in
1942, it would have been quite a trick for the Japanese to forsee
relocation (remember, nothing like it had happened in US history).  
>Do you
>really see them as equivalent?  
I see -- the parallel is that the Sandinistas didn't explicitly 
remove all civil rights until recently, so that the suspension of civil
rights cannot be used as a pretext for justifying Contra aid unless
the Japanese-American Internment may be used as a pretext for Pearl Harbor.
That's cute -- I like it.  The problem for you is that IF a revolution
were to happen in the US that endangered and oppressed people, THEN
the Japanese would have had a case for an attack on that government's
authority -- not on Pearl Harbor.  IF that government then were to
declare martial law, then those who argued that ""The US still has a
pretty free government"" would have been dealt a mild blow. (Mild only
because the counter-argument that they only did it because they ""had
no choice"" can be raised).

So?  I argue that the nature of ANY government, particularly one that
claims tight control of its citizens is violence.  My point is that
if he should, you should.  Not that neither of you should.

How about: ""Nobody contends the Sandinistas have clean hands.  Though

one expects of an authoritarian government under a lot of pressure. But

Degradation and death didn't come into this except as implicitly understood
by everyone as being in the cards for both sides, until YOU mentioned it
as something Jan SHOULD have mentioned.  He didn't, but you HADN'T, and
it's just nasty of you to insist that a government in power is somehow
more sacred than a revolutionary movement (or did you prefer 
pre-revolutionary Nicaragua to post-revolutionary?)

Perhaps you should have just avoided suggesting that

And it's NOT a good question (if you leave out the implication that
anybody has said they want to destroy the Nicaraguan people), but the
question of whether we have the ""right"" to do nothing while people are
being killed is worth asking, too.  BOTH sides involve ""degradation
and death"".  That one involves less than the other is hard to prove,
and there's enough gore to go around without the debating trick of
insisting that the fellow advocating one move in a complex and bloody
situation is required to mention that HE's talking about degradation
and death.

Look:  Find me a Contra who believes that the contras, and only the contras,
are responsible for the armed struggle going on there.  Find me one who
believes that his people would be alive and free under the Sandinistas.
If you have trouble finding such a person (and I propose the ""search""
as a thought-experiment) perhaps it is because THEY believe that things
are better in the most important ways if THEY win.  It's not certain to
me, but I suspect a fair portion of those guys think they'll do better
if they have Yankee aid.

WHOA!  Just let's hear the answer to the question.  Jan is indeed proposing
to send aid to the Contras, and whatever his reason, if the Sandinistas
kill and degrade (notice how ""blowing things up"" has crept in) people,
then COUNTERING them (even if it means other instances of killing and
degrading MAY have as firm a basis in terms of 
minimizing death and degradation as NOT countering them.  Certainly in
ARGUMENT one may not simply insist that this is not true -- one may therefore
not require that the ""other side"" be held to closer rules of conduct
than the ""good side"".
>Jan *does* support the Contras.  The whole *point* of the Contras
>is to kill and blow things up.  You cannot support the Contras
>without supporting killing and blowing things up.  
Oh sure..... I can just hear the Contra's wife: ""Well dear, another nice
day of killing and blowing things up?""  ""Yes Honey, today will be a 
quota-buster for sure.  Think I'll kill our cat first"".  I know of no
movement, anywhere, whose members thought of themselves as having as
an end value the destruction of lives and property.  To accuse the 
Contras of this (without providing facts) is to do what you yourself
have asked that Jan not do -- take a position without revealing 
the factual basis.  As you say, this wouldn't excuse Jan from doing it,
but your own position is weakened if you seem to be requiring Jan's
side to meet specs that your side does not meet.  Let's be clear here:
the issue is whether to fund the Contras.  For the moment, let's simplify
the situation by saying that Jan says ""yes"" and you say ""no"".  If you
simply place, as a bald statement, that the whole point of the 
Contras is to blow things up, (after stating in great detail the importance
of supporting a position factually) then you'd better be able to 
back it up -- and the notion that ""The whole point of the contras is to
kill and blow things up"" strikes me as off in left field.  You may not
agree with the Contras, but it would be like saying the whole point
of the Highway system is to have accidents, or that the whole point of the
legislature is to enslave people.

>politicians in the U.S. and elsewhere.
>So, why do you ask the questin you do, unless it is from a Manichean view?
Let me ease your bafflement.  As I understand it, ""Manichaean"" refers to 
a tendency to divide the world up into starkly evil and starkly good 
parts.  For example, if I were to tell you that blowing things up and
killing was ALWAYS evil, and therefore supporters of it were EVIL,
and that standing neutral or refusing to blow things up was ALWAYS
better, then I'd be taking a Manichaean stance.  As it happens, I'm saying
that even remaining neutral has both good and bad sides, that it's possible
to kill and blow things up in a good cause (though I'm not here saying
that the Contras are, merely that the action, while repugnant, may have
overridingly good consequences).  Similarly, the refraining from action
involved in neutrality is NOT always or purely good, and I've pointed
this out.  
If you say: ""Jan should mention that the policies he's supporting result
in real degradation and death"", but then argue that restraint is a better
policy, you'd better be prepared to argue that restraint results in less
degradation and death.  In particular, you'd better be prepared to show
that restraint does NOT result in degradation and death unless you are also
willing to talk about such degradation and death as a 
result of restraint.  As a widely-read person
who makes a big point about how necessary it is to be well informed before
advocacy, I asked you to tell us either that there is NO such degradation
and death (in which case you would indeed be excused from the sauce for
the goose.... argument) or to concede that the Sandinistas have indeed
indulged themselves, in which case LEAVING them in place involves
(judging from the past) degradation and death, in which case an advocate
of THAT policy (leaving the Sandinistas unmolested) must ALSO mention
degradation and death -- he's advocating letting it continue.

Nobody argues that -- hardly.  Sauce for the goose though -- the 
Sandinistas have dirty hands too.  Let's not demand that their
opponents be the only ones who must admit to advocating violence.
It doesn't MATTER that you aren't arguing that the Sandinistas should
be supported.  It doesn't MATTER that I think you're correct about the
stance our country should take (""stay out"").  What matters is that you're
asking Jan to argue as if he were evil, or advocating evil, when it's
unknown to any of us what the best move is.","-x9hG4s9j-cJ",0,1985-12-08,-20,0

Also  you think WRONG, since I called you no such thing.  I said I was

claim you aren't one.  Not the same thing.
    I happen to think you're a KGB agent, hired to spread second-level
disinformation   under   guise  of  a  Klansman  and  neo-Nazi.   Said
disinformation, when exposed, will lead to more favorable  perceptions

control, perhaps outright confiscation:  O, ye fools who have read  so

    You  proclaim  the  existence  and  malevolent power of a sinister

    Does the audience still seek confirmation of ""self-contradictory?""
Another  example  from  the  same  posting that included the preceding
quotes:  [From Mr. Black's Memorial Day address,  a  fitting  time  to
stir patriotic fervor, and a suspension of healthy skepticism.]
	>     But this time the Rockefeller/Rothschild Internationalist

definition?  Why on earth would they team up with the Bolsheviks,  and
lose  their  fortunes?   Or, assuming they could retain their fortunes
and privilege  in  a  Soviet-run  world,  why  would  these  aesthetic
sybarites want to see their world turn as gray and unhappy as it would
become under such conditions.  Better to own a  beautiful  world  than
control an ugly one, no?
    So what is Mr. Black up to?  Why would  he  bother  to  leave  his
credibility  so  vulnerable?   Assuming he really meant it, wouldn't a
slightly less hysterical tone  accomplish  the  same  task  with  less
likelihood  of  failure?   How can we reconcile such absurd flights of
rhetoric with his obviously keen mind?  The answer may surprise you...
 
    There  are  TWO  American  audiences  that  Don Black is trying to
reach, and he  expects  to  stir  opposing  reactions  in  each:   The
interplay  between  the  two,  and  the  resulting  stratification and
internecine hostility in American society, displays the genius in  his
(well,  more  likely Colonel General Viktor Vissarionavich Bogdanov's,
of the 12th Propaganda and  Psychological  Warfare  Directorate,  KGB)
scheme.
    First,  there  are  the  true  believers; people of low education,
sophistication, and mental equipage.  They are  economically  buffeted
by  a  changing  world and their manifest inability to keep abreast of
things, and stricken in their pride by everything from civil rights to
feminism   to   gay   rights.    These  are  the  farmers,  unemployed
manufacturing workers, Vietnam Vets unsuccessfully  reintegrated  into
American  society,  bikers  who  never grew up, prudish and ultimately
dissatisfied mothers, and other marginal types  who  join  KKK,  Posse
Comitatus  and  similar  organizations.   Their lives are dominated by
disappointment, fear and hatred, and ""leaders"" like Don Black and Rev.
Jim  Wickstrom  (also  undoubtedly a plant, with rhetoric identical to
Mr.  Black's when it comes to ""one-world international slave traders"")
whip  up  for  them a vainglorious fantasy life of taking to the hills
and fighting off the Commies and  tax  collectors  (in  no  particular
order) with their pitiful, illegally automatized weapons.  They find a
cohesive philosophy in Messrs. Black's and Wickstrom's  Fundamentalist
Christianity,
	>	     		     *  *
	>	   		   ***  ***
	>	 In Hoc Signo    *****  *****	Vinces
	>	
	>			******  ******
	>	 		 *****  *****
	>	  		  ****  ****
	>	   		   ***  ***
	>	    		    **  **
	>	     		     *  *
[in this sign we will win] and a sense of worth in believing they (and
this country) are the Chosen  of  God.   Coincidentally,  that  latter
belief  is  bolstered by fanatical hostility to the ""other"" contenders
for that title, namely the  Jews,  and  you'll  find  Anti-Semitism  a
significant  part  of  their  belief  structure.  This is the class of
people Don Black wants ""behind"" him, believing his words.
The second group is far more important:  It consists of solid citizens
in  positions  of influence.  Mr. Black has no hope of convincing them
with his apparently childish fulminations.  Rather his  scheme  is  to
_alienate_  the  intellectuals,  and by dint of shrill accusations and
nonsensical rhetoric convince them of Mao's favorite dictum  [item  27
out of 402 in the little red book]:  ""Whoever is the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.  Whoever is the friend of my enemy  is  my  enemy.""   If
people  get  disgusted  enough  by  his postings (and speeches, if the
papers report them), they'll  look  more  favorably  at  the  Soviets,
simply because he ""opposes"" them so vehemently.
There's one more thread to tie in, namely gun control:  Note that  Mr.
Black  is  apparently  fanatically  against it, claiming the citizenry
needs its guns to fight off attacking Soviet ground forces, let  alone
common  criminals.   Also, note that he makes no secret of his support
for automatic weaponry in the hands of private  citizens  --  he  even
posted  a  message telling how to convert a legal semi-automatic AR-15
to an illegal fully automatic one.
    Why?
    Let's expand a previous quote:
	>     But this time the Rockefeller/Rothschild Internationalist clique
	>has made one fatal mistake.  Those of us who survived the Viet Nam era
	>have learned the lessons of warmaking all too well, lessons we will 
	>not easily forget.  WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO USE OUR SKILLS one
	>more time to keep our Nation and People free.  
The  federal  government  already  identifies  Posse  Comitatus  as  a
terrorist organization, and the KKK has been known as one for  a  long
time.   [I  don't  know whether they enjoy the official designation at
present.  Probably not, since they're so fragmented.]  The people  who
undertake  their  depredations  are not the Blacks and the Wickstroms,
but the poor psychos who really believe.  Because  they  are  amassing
automatic weapons, they are becoming a match, in individual cases, for
local police departments.  In future, they can  be  expected  to  grow
stronger,  and  engage in raids, robberies, assassinations, attacks on
synagogues (which are already  taking  place,  for  example)  and  the
issuance  of vigilante ""justice,"" probably against prominent leftists,
liberals, Jews, Blacks,  Hispanic  politicians,  and  immigrants,  for
example  from  SE  Asia.   [KKK involvement is suspected in attacks on
Cambodians in East Boston this summer.]   These  outrages  will  bring
heavier and heavier police reaction.  Due to the armament these groups
possess,  and  their  fanatic  nature,  there  will  be  a  series  of
increasingly  bloody  confrontations  between  these  people  and  the
authorities, possibly involving the national guard if  the  police  in
some location find themselves outclassed.
    Such  incidents will build strong pro-gun-control sentiments among
ordinary citizens and conceivable Agents of Influence,  including  the
technological  professionals.   Even  a proponent of personal defense,
such as myself, might consider myself better off if guns were strictly
controlled  than  if  I  had  to deal with automatic-weapon attacks by
multiple assailants with my little eight-shooter (or even fourteen...)
Not that the claims of guns-against-Russians ever made sense, but with
that  ostensible  excuse  among  the  survivalists,  and  a  worsening
domestic picture, more Draconian laws can be expected to come down the
pike.  The role of us well-to-do netters (ahem)  will  be  to  support
such  legislation,  our  resistance  to  gun  control  sapped  by  the
relatively  chaotic  national  scene  and  the  known   stupidity   of
anti-gun-control rhetoric.  Also to advocate and support authoritarian
measures, given the perverse and limitedd type of class  warfare  that
Mr.   Black's  friends  and rhetoric seem to advocate.  As part of the
general abreaction to neo-conservative excesses, one can  expect  that
politicians   advocating   vigilance  against  the  Soviet  Union  and
sacrifices to provide for the common defense will have a tougher time,
being tarred by their association with the people committing outrages.
Hence US arms policy will move more toward appeasement  while  at  the
same  time domestic policy will become harsher.  What better method of
weakening our defenses  abroad  and  increasing  dissatisfaction  (and
turmoil) at home?
    If it seems I have rolled over full circle and indicated that  the
Soviets  would  indeed like to invade us, rest assured I meant no such
thing.  USSR would be crazy to do anything like that, given that  they
can  accomplish  their goals (of making opposing nations compliant) by
less drastic means.  [They'd  be  crazy  to  do  something  like  that
anyway,  but  that's another issue.]  As the US continues to move into
conventional inferiority with the USSR, the Soviets can support  their
friends,  hurt  ours,  support  revolutions, garner the sponsorship of
national liberation movements, intimidate the Europeans into unlinking
their   defense  from  our  own  (and  extracting  tributes  of  trade
privileges, if nothing else) without spending a drop of Russian  blood
[not  that they're afraid to...], while we exhaust ourselves resolving
the violent internal contradictions that Mr.  Black and his cohorts so
assiduously pursue.
    Not that Mr. Black's work is the ""enslavement"" of the US  --  that
would  make  little sense, given that WE'RE the Soviet breadbasket and
research establishment, and we'd be far less efficient if we knowingly
did  it  all  for them.  Just a general weakening of American resolve.
No biggie...  We all play our little parts, some  more  dramatic  than
others.
    Besides, if the Russians ever invaded, or ""enslaved"" the  US,  Mr.
Black  would  be  the  first  one up against the wall and shot --- his
demagogic skills, and knowledge of what's really going on, would  make
him  far too dangerous to be let loose.  I wonder if he'd confess at a
show trial, like the 1930s purge victims, giving their deaths as  well
as  their  lives  to  further  the people's revolution, already in the
monster's hands.  [Of course  not  --  what  occupying  general  would
bother with a trial?]  Ah well, idle speculation.
 
    Before  I  leave,  I'd  like to look at Mr. Black's protestations,
not as nicely done as the rest of his propaganda:
	>    THE name of the game apparently is that if you can't make 
	>a logical argument against what's being said, then by all means 
	>discredit the person.  All's fair in love and war.
		...
     	>    It's too bad that the net has to be subjected to ""Ad
	>Hominem"" slurs.  But I suppose if They let me on the net,
	>They can let this kind of crap continue.  C'est la guerre,
	>n'est-ce pas?
    No, it's not too bad.  It's part of the job:  You were supposed to
draw  the  lightning,  thereby defusing the suspicion.  Of course, you
were expected to protest, but THAT you could have  done  better.   5.2
out of 10, and that's being generous.
		 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
    Is it now clear why I have called you ""Comrade"" these many months?
PS:  Donald, you're clearly  an  American,  no  mole.   Did  you  fool
yourself too, in the end?

Actually, I doubt the insurance companies would go for this.  It only solves
half of the issue (if it even does that).  Suppose, that I (with my seatbelt
discount) go out driving with me belt on and run into (my fault) someone else
who is not wearing their seatbelt.  My policy is still obliged to pay.

So social darwinism rears its ugly head on the net.  I was just reading
something like this earlier today.  Let me see...  here it is:
    Social Darwinists, following the English social theorist Herbert
    Spencer, thought all such regulation unwise.  ""Very many of the
    poorer classes are injured by druggists' prescriptions and quack
    medicines, Spencer willingly conceded.  But there was nothing wrong
    in that; it was the penalty nature attached to ignorance.  If the
    poor died of their own foolishness, the species would improve.""
		   -- Paul Starr, ""The Social Transformation of
		      American Medicine,"" quoted in the Texas Observer
Funny.  I thought that the cruder examples of this sort of thinking had died
out some time ago.  Obviously they haven't (unless our friend was merely
being facetious).
I've got an even better idea -- why not actively discourage the use of
seatbelts with a heavy tax?  If the social darwinists are right, that should
increase not only the world's average intelligence but its average wealth as
well!  :-{

No offense intended, but this is just the kind of thing that makes lawyers
have unassisted orgasms, makes judges commit suicide, makes insurance
company execs give smug little I'll-get-that-extra-Mercedes-this-year-
after-all smiles, and makes your average Joe's wallet look like an
Ethiopian famine victim.
Who is to decide that an accident could have been prevented by wearing a
seatbelt?  If the insurance company doesn't want to pay the injured all
they have to do is start too long, too expensive court battle to wear
the injured, the courts, and the rest of us down.  This area is far too
subjective and nebulous to be put into an arena where it can cause so
much grief.
My solution to seatbelt, helmet, anti-suicide, and other such 'preventative'
laws is simple:  get rid of them.  You're going to tell me that I can't
take a risk that endangers no one but me?  You're going to tell me that
I can't kill myself if I want to?  Rubbish!
By the way, the You in ""You're going to tell me...."" above is not
directed at Peter, just at legislators in general.
They let people hang-glide and water-ski without helmets, don't they?

When Texas was considering its recently enacted seat-belt law, this very
thing was proposed as an alternative.  It got shot down primarily by
practical considerations--If a non-seat belt user was in an accident, it
was pointed out, all they had to do (assuming they were conscious),
was to quickly buckle up their belts before the dust settled.
Obviously this argument has a few holes, but nobody ever lost money
betting on the lack of intellectual quality of Texas legislators..(-: :-)

While the risks may endanger no-one but you (perhaps), its not true that
they harm no-one but you.  When you are injured, your insurance pays you,
and I pay your insurance company.  You sit in hospital and use the last
bed, so the hospital has to build a new wing, and I pay for it.  You
croak, and use the last cheap plot in the cemetery, so now I have to
buy a more expensive one.  After all this, your ""freedom"" has still
not stopped costing me ...  Now your ex-employer has to employ someone
else, and train them, I pay more for his product.
So, please, if you want to kill yourself, do it in some way that
everyone knows that's what you are doing, and make sure that you
succeed, no insurance, no hospital.  That still doesn't recover
all the costs, but it at least will save some of them.  Remember
that society has an investment in you - you owe us!

   an auto fatality (the cost to the police and hospitals to

   wearing seat belts.  (There was also one fire, although
   nobody could figure out why the car caught fire; Volvo moved
   the gas tank the next year.)
As a result of this study, Sweden passed a mandatory seat belt
law.
In addition to protecting you in a crash, a good seat belt will
support you if you have to swerve your car to avoid an accident,
thus preventing accidents as well.

An interesting viewpoint, and I can see your point somewhat, but:
a) You live in New York City (I know you don't, but pretend); there is
   a higher crime rate there, and when you get mugged your insurance
   company pays and I pay your insurance company.  I could give a lot
   more examples, but the basic line is that life (and ESPECIALLY
   insurance) ain't fair.  If you're interested in such things,
   definitely take the time to read _The_Invisible_Bankers_ by
   Andrew Tobias.
b) You hang glide and fly small planes, so you get injured and/or
   killed.  I pay.  Life is a bitch, ain't it?
My basic message here is much more objective than that:  There are
insurance discounts for non-smokers for the reasons that you put
forth above, and I like that because I am a non-smoker.  Am I really
a non-smoker?  Send me to your insurance company's doctor and I
guarantee you he can answer that question reliably unless I work
in a coal mine or in downtown L.A.  Now, do I really wear my
seatbelt all the time?  Who knows but me?

I owe you?  OK, I guess you're right -- I'll do my good deed by
reducing the population, not contributing to the rise in population
at a later date, not consuming anymore food, energy, or space; and
I'll lower the unemployment rate at the same time -- all by suicide!!
Pretty effective little act, isn't it?
As for your earlier point about you paying for this and that, what
about the jobs that I create in the insurance, health care, and
burial industries?  Not to mention the work afforded to florists (assuming
someone likes me enough to send flowers to either the hospital and/or
the funeral), the minister who reads my eulogy, the lawyers who squabble
over my estate, the coroner who does the autopsy... I could go on for
days!!
I think I'll go off myself right now; what a great feeling to be
benefiting others!!

One problem with the above solution is the difficulty in determining
whether or not seat-belts would have an advantageous effect or not.
Also, what happens when I hit someone (my fault) and they didn't have
a seat belt on? Am I less liable because they didn't wear one?
The new trend of mandatory seat-belt laws is so ridiculous! 
My home state of North Carolina is having their law go into 
effect Oct. 1. I am a habitual seat-belt user but I'm almost
ready to not wear them past Oct. 1. I think it's just another
excuse for police to inspect vehicles.
I fully support mandatory child restraint laws, however.
The difference: kids can't responsibly decide whether or
not to wear them and shouldn't be penalized by death for 
having bone-headed parents.

I believe that if a seat belt user is involved in an accident, the selt
belt will stretch enough that investigators can easily tell the selt belt
has been through an accident.
I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.

and non-user) would be a good idea.
It is claimed that it is easy to cheat.  In most accidents it
should be easy to tell.  A significant number of non-users end
up dead.  Others are unconscious.  Some are thrown clear of the
car, or across the car to the other side.  Others would be too
dazed to think of buckling up afterwards.  The nature of the
injuries would often be decisive.  For example, if a person's
forehead is caved in from hitting the dash the force of the
accident would probably cause belt bruises on wearers.
Showering glass particles would probably leave a shadow where
the belt is.  Patterns of blood on clothing and the belt would
indicate a lot to an investigator.
Even if people did successfully cheat some of the time, the
benefit in terms of lowered premiums to belt wearers would still
be sufficient to be desirable.
I am sure the insurance companies have statistics on how much
cost is incurred in paying to people in accidents who are
wearing seatbelts vs. those not wearing.  This would form the
basis for differential premiums, which I think would be rather
large.  Those carrying ""belted"" policies who are injured while
not wearing belts could be paid out at a rate proportional to
the differential.  Policies could be offered with four options:
(1) unbelted driver and passengers, (2) belted passengers,
unbelted driver, (3) belted driver, unbelted passengers, and (4)
belted driver and passengers.  The same differential payouts
could apply, although I think it would be advisable to only
offer two options depending on the driver wearing or not wearing
a belt and pay out for passengers regardless, since a passenger
often would not know what kind of policy the driver carries and
could in any case be purposely mislead by the driver.
The argument that requiring occupants to wear seatbelts
infringes on their freedom is often buttressed by analogy to
risky things like hang-gliding.  While I am less in favour of
seatbelt legislation as time goes by, (especially when choices
can be offered as in insurance options), I would like to refute
the argument.  The analogy is not strictly applicable since it
is impossible to hang-glide without hang-gliding but it is
possible to sit in a moving car wearing seat-belts.
The point that the foolishness of non-users costs all of us has
not been made strongly enough.  By far the greatest cost to
society is the loss of productivity and creativity from the
injured and the dead.  Of course, anyone has the right to be
unproductive and uncreative.
Seatbelts on drivers help them maintain their position at the
controls and therefore lessen the chance that they will lose
control after primary collisions or unforeseen gyrations (i.e.
skids).  Thus they lessen the chance that they will hit oncoming
traffic or pedestrians thereby injuring or killing innocent
bystanders.","BqLiEtCGqQgJ",1,1985-07-30,1,0

        I'm not to sure about that,  but  wouldn't  the  injuries  the
        person  wearing  the  seatbelt be identifibly different from a
        person who was  not  wearing  a  seatbelt?  In  a  high  speed

        bruises across the waist and  chest  where  the  straps  were.
        Also  a  person  wearing  a seatbelt would be unlikely to have
        suffered head injuries.

        wearing  seatbelts  doesn't  strike  me as very practical.  It

This is true. If fact, If you are in a moderately severe accident it is
recommended (at least by consumer reports) that you replace your seatbelts
because they cannot absorb a second shock as well and could possibly fail.

From experience, I can testify that this is true. It's surprising the kind of
evidence that a trained investigator can find. 
I had an accident where I was rear-ended by a car massing more than twice
mine, traveling about 35-50 MPH upon impact. I had my left-turn signal going
(and my brakes on -OUCH!-), which was verified by the particular way the
remnants of the bulb's filaments deposited themselves upon the remnants of
the bulb!
Anyway, why couldn't the insurance company simply nullify the policy if
the owner of the policy sustained injuries that wouldn't occur if he had
been wearing his belt? (I know, this merely narrows the margin where it
is questionable, yet it becomes pretty small.) I dislike paying higher
premiums because other people don't wear their belts.

    They don't even need to *try* to verify which of their customers actually
wears their seat belts.  All they'd have to do is to offer two types of
insurance: seat-belted and non-seatbelted.  The only difference would be that
seat-belted would cost less, and wouldn't pay for injuries caused by not
wearing seat belts.  As <someone> above points out, there should be big
differences in the types of injuries which occur so that a non-belted
driver using belted insurance wouldn't be able to fool anyone by putting the
belt on after the accident.

Points are well taken.  Being basically a libertarian by nature, I had
thought of the insurance non-payment plan as an alternative to the intrusive
nature of a seat belt law, but couldn't come up with a counter to the
""buckling up"" after the fact argument.
However, it does seem that from a legislative point of view, a variation
on the original argrument could be used.  Might not litigants argue that
they really did have their seat belts on, but the accident wasn't severe
enough to stretch them?  This is all promising, but I think we need
more information, and possibly a body of case law, to convince legislators...

Okay Bob, since I have a financial interest in your attitudes
and lifestyle, I expect to be able to influence your attitudes
and your lifestyle. Please submit to me (address below) a detailed
account of your personal habits. Please include such information
as:
	1. Eating habits (I don't want you to eat foods that
	   could give you health problems I would pay for.)
	2. Drinking and smoking behaviors (I won't pay for
	   your liver problems or lung cancer treatment.)
	3. Hobbies (No hang-gliding, white-water canoeing, etc...)
	4. Sexual behaviors (I want all your potential partners
	   to be certified AIDS and herpes free.)
I'm sure I have missed many relevant aspects of your life that
could cause me finacial distress. Once I have discussed these with
my fellow-society members, we will submit to you new life-style guidelines
that you will be forced to adhere to under penalty of law.

If the accident wasn't severe enough to stretch the seat belts,
then the medical damages ought to be very low.
If litigant's face is broken from hitting the windshield, even a jury is
unlikely to believe the seat belt was actually used. (where seat belt
means combination lap/shoulder belt)

In some states you are.  California used to be one, but I'm not sure if  it
still  is.  The  concept  involved  is  ""contributory negligence"".  If they
weren't wearing a seatbelt then their injuries are at  least  partly  their

VILLAGE  VOICE  article written by Roger Wilkens.  The next day I
was to attend the benefit 'Comic Relief' sponsored  by  the  AIDS
Medical  Foundation  here  in New York.  I was thinking about how
what Roger Wilkens said affected me not just as a black  man  but
as a gay man.
After the show there was a party held for large  contributors  at
the  Harvard  Club.   I  spoke  with  many people there about the
challenge  that  AIDS  represents;  not  just  to   the   medical
establishment,  but  to  the   education   establishment.   About
the challenge AIDS represents; not just to the gay community, but
to  the  community  at-large.   I thought about the importance of
educating  our young to  remember the hardships of  others,  what
they  went  through,  what  they endured.  This, obviously, means
different things to different people.   But,  Wilkens  was  right
about  the  importance of being strong.  Not just for minorities,
but for all of us.  We must each  be  strong  in  addressing  and
dealing  with  the hardships that many of us now endure.  We must
be thoughtful in our approach and sympathetic.   We  must  reject
illogic and emotional reaction; stupidity and hatred.
Those who attack affirmative action, those who wish to ignore the
needs  of  the  under-privileged, those who might suggest that we
forget the Holocaust, or  earlier  holocausts  committed  by  men
against  men,  ignore  the  lesson  to  be  learned  through  the
collective human experience.
Some mornings when I get on the subways to go to work, and  we're
all  pressed  into  those  train  cars  elbow to elbow, breast to
breast, it seems there is always someone who reacts negatively to
the  situation.   You  hear,  'Bitch!  Don't touch me!'  You hear
moanings and groanings, complaints,  accusations.   We  must  all
remember  that we're in this together.  We created the situations
and must now endure them or do what we can to change  them;  each

died last night.  I'm not much on eulogizing, or breast-beating, but I
always felt that this country was extremely lucky to have had Erwin where he
was during the 1970's.  I was living in DC during that period, and it was a
relief to know that we had a *statesman* overlooking the Watergate hearings;
we've had damn few of them lately.  And it seemed, from third-party
information we are provided by the media, that he was a good man.  Enough
said.
On reading further into the Seattle Times obituary, I began to examine the
various praises and eulogies of those in the political arena.  One
statement, however, stopped me dead in my tracks, and has raised my blood
pressure several points.  Jesse Helms, one of the few politcos I would truly
term narrow-minded and cruel, was quoted as saying that Ervin was his
""mentor"".
Mentor.  I take this to mean that Jesse's views and ideals were shaped by
the late Senator.  That his political code of ethics were patterned after
his colleague.  That his behavior in public reflected the high standards
Ervin was famous for.
As Bill Cosby would say, ""RIIIIIIIGHT!""
I find it difficult to stomach the allegation that a man who refers to the
AIDS epidemic among the homosexual community as a deserved plague from God,
feels that nuclear war is winnable, and alleges that we don't have enough
money to feed the poor but subsidies for the tobacco industry are essential,
got his guiding principles from one of the few role models to come out of
American politics in the last few years.  It's a parting insult to Ervin's
memory, and a fairly obvious political sucking-up, but what can you expect
from such despicable human garbage?
If Helms is going to name mentors, I suggest that he proposes people a
little closer to his point-of-view and personality, like Jerry Falwell.  Or
Adolph Eichmann.

(What should I call the latter?  Liberals?) I think each side is in need
of a better understanding of the other.  (Whether they want it is another
question.)  I think it's foolish and narrow minded to blame either side
for all the evil in the world or for wanting to take over the country
and run things their way.  Each side pits its followers agianst the other
in real ""true believer"" fashion.  Having a ""devil"" to blame the worlds ills
on is a convenient way of stirring up fanatical support for their cause.
I think each ""side"" is to blame for many problems and each has done some
good.  I for one am not afraid to support the MM where I think they are
right as well a oppose them where they are wrong.  Same goes for the other
groups.  
IN MY OPINION:
I think that the Moral Majority's use of power bloc politics is out of
character for a group supposedly based on Christian principles.  Above
that, they are sure God agrees with them on every point.  Fallwell's
proclaimation of AIDS as being God's judgement of homosexuals is totally
unfounded.  (With the same reasoning, I guess you could say that Liberals
are God's judgment against the MM ;-) ).  Also, his fund raising tactics
sicken me.  There's no excuse for it.  Though I disagree strongly with
many of the MM's beliefs and practices, I find no reason to condemn them
as an organization.  No more reason, that is, than I have to condemn People
for the American Way (Who's president is also a Baptist minister BTW) as
an organization.  To support one only because they are in opposition to
the other is foolishness.  People should learn how to think rather than
be told what to think.  That takes listening to both sides--effort which
few people are willing to take.
I don't think that people should condemn the MM's involvement in politics
before they realize that the groups they oppose are doing the same thing
(and using the same methods) with their ideas.  And I think the news media
definitely biases itself against the MM.  If you think that all Christians
who see an application of biblical principles for society are ""Falwellites""
think again.  Political involvement works both ways.  Everyone in our
society has the right to influence it with whatever principles they think
are right.  And I think they should be able to do so on par with others.
To label one group as ""dangerous"" and target them for suppression is 
committing a wrong far worse than any wrong ideas the opposing group might
have.
Speaking of book burning and censorship, Liberals have been praciticing it
for years under the guise of ""instilling proper values in our children"" and
""removing stereotypes and religious influences"".  Cal Thomas, Falwell's
right-hand-man (who seems to have a bit more common sense than Jerry) has
written a book called ""Book Burning"".  If anyone really wants to have
an understanding of the conflict that the MM sees themselves in, I suggest
you read it.  I expected this book to be an emotional tirade against Liberalism
but Thomas has made a good attempt at being reasonable and fair.  So before
you call *them* ""book burners"" read ""Book Burning"".  You're arguing from
ignorance, otherwise.  One thing the book documents it the exclusion of 
Christian authored books from major bookstore chains and ""best seller's
lists"".  In response to this B. Dalton's has stocked up on many of the
best selling books.  I was impressed.  They expanded their inventory and
moved the ""religious"" section from the back to the middle of the store.
They even buy advertising regularly in ""Christianity Today"".  I'm sure
B. Dalton stands to make a lot of money by breaking into this lucrative
market.  But still... B. Dalton .....  My hat is off.
An example of Liberal intolerance would be the 'welcome' Fallwell received
when he spoke at Harvard last year.  Contrast that with the warm reception
that Ted Kennedy received at Liberty Baptist College a few months later.
It seems that cat calls and jeers at Jerry Falwell are justified because
""Falwell is wrong and Liberals are right"".  But I'd bet if Kennedy had
been treated the same way at LBC we all would have read about it in the
news as an example of ""bigoted fundamentalist fanaticism"".

the stereotypes.   One of them is that those who oppose the
(im)Moral(not)Majorty are liberals.  I've lambasted the MM
several times on this net, usually in detail, and for
specific actions that represent the abridgement of freedoms
or the substitution of religious for legal principles.
None the less, I suspect that few net readers will accuse me of being
a ""flaming liberal"".   (Well?  Do any of you? :-)
I object violently to stereotypes for several reasons.  The most
fundamental are ethical, but since ethics never afflicted most
of the net, (NOT you, Paul, you are at least consistant, and
you argue, as opposed to shout, shame I can't mail to you...)
let me point out a reason that involves mere self-interest:
	When the Grenadian liberation (yeah, I'm going to use
revolutionary terminology)  was aided by the U.S. government,
I was probably the foremost supporter of that invasion on this
net.  I was labelled as an ""unrepentitant conservative"", and there
was a long debate about whether or not conservatives should
be considered human, with lots of accusations flying back and
forth accusing either me or the other side <that was about how it
felt> of stupidity, moral terpitude, and many other things.  
Several people faked cancellation messages for my articles
in order to shut me up, and we considered linking my mailbox to
/dev/null for a week to keep the deliberate mail misusers
from crashing rabbit by filling up our spool filesystem.
The upshot of this damnfool discussion was the use of
""rabbit!jj"" as an example of the worst example of a net user for
about six months or so.  <This attitude did, in fact, get back
to my management, who complained to me. I hope you bloody censors
out there are satisfied, Tim (not M., for heavens sake!).>
Well.  Now I've been sucked into the abortion debate.  Again,
I'm using EXACTLY the same ethical basis, (defense of personal
freedom)  but NOW I'm the ""damned satanic communist liberal"" 
who ""would eat dead babies for breakfast"". <You should see my 
BAD mail...> Hell!  Now, I'm a liberal of the most extreme bent.
Will you all make up your minds???  I didn't even know
that teddy bears were active in politics.  :-)
The next time that you use a stereotype, try to remember that
the victim of your stereotype is probably a thinking being who
will both be hurt by, and resent, your prejudice.

Oops, I think that one was muddy too!  It may have been a slip, but there
are an awful lot of ""anti-falwellites"" who would be gravely insulted to be
called ""liberals""...in fact, opposition to Falwell comes from a remarkably
widespread base.

I disagree strongly.  I will condemn anyone for using immoral or unethical
tactics to gain his ends.  If both the MM and their opponents are playing
dirty politics to get their own selfish ways, they are both wrong and I am
against both.  Ends DO NOT justify means.  (Looking at it from the other
side, I won't condemn Christianity just because the MM behaves scandalously
and claims to be a Christian organization.  Their behavior drags them down
but need not take all of Christianity with it.)
I believe that the reason that the MM is so often blasted for their actions
is that they claim to be a Christian organization, yet they don't seem to
show the alleged Christian traits of forgiveness, tolerance, kindness, etc.
If I saw Falwell's behavior in an avowed politician, I would regard it as
characteristic of underhanded, scurrilous politics - which seems to be the
way politics is conducted, as often as not.  But Falwell alleges himself to
be operating not so much as a politician but as a Christian leader.  Hence
I must regard him as not only scurrilous but hypocritical.  That's why he
gets more than his ""fair share"" of abuse from other camps.

In my book, the catcalls and jeers would be wrong in either direction...but
I suppose that in each case the audience treated the speaker with the same
regard that they have come to expect from the speaker.  That is, while
Kennedy has no use for the reactionary Protestant fundamentalists, at least
he can keep a civil tongue in his head most of the time.  Falwell, on the
other hand, would be happy to drive the liberals from the face of the earth
straight through the gates of hell if he had the power - and he was greeted
with corresponding respect.

The above is quoted in full, in part because I agree with it, but in part
because the entire thing could be reworded without reference to religion.
Consider the articles a few weeks ago by the person who was so certain
that a nuclear reactor under construction had to be stopped at all costs.
He felt that because he was RIGHT, he had the right to use force (not violence)
to impose his views.
There are many groups of people who are sure they are right about something,
and only the stupidity/evil of the rest of the world prevents them from
agreeing.  That's not so bad, but the ""logic"" often follows that these
people have the right (or even duty) to impose their views on everyone
else for their own good.
Perhaps some of these fanatics do have truth on their side.  Worse, perhaps
there are good rational arguments, but these arguments are too subtle to
be effectively presented in a public forum.  How do we distinguish
rational fanatics from irrational ones.  How do we distinguish rational
but wrong fanatics from rational but correct ones?  Whose views should
we all accept for our own good?
For my part, I tend to agree with almost everything Jesus proclaimed or
tried to teach, and with almost nothing that so-called Christians say.
That means, to quote another prophet of a different age: ""Let a thousand
flowers bloom.""

published in the column of Amnon Dankner in Ha'aretz, one of the leading
Israeli dailies, on November 5.  It was surrounded with quotation marks in
36 point size.  I understand this to indicate that Dankner is quoting a
soldier who witnessed the events described.
The camp described seems to be the Al Ansar detention camp the Israelis
erected in southern Lebanon.  In it they have been holding at least 7000
Palestinians most of them detained after the fighting ended, during sweeps
of the refugee camps.  Some ""disturbances"" were reported there a while ago,
one of which could be that described here.
In a talk here at Berkeley, the chair of the Israeli League for Human and
Civil Rights reported that the Israelis have not agreed to make public the
names of the detainees, nor to allow them to meet with Red Cross
representatives of lawyers.  Any Israeli officer above the rank of Major has
the right to arrest any person in Lebanon and have him sent to such a camp.
No family members or other local authorities are notified, there is no
review and the arrest order may be renewed indefinitely.  Even the Labor
party voted against the law that gave the military this authority in
Lebanon.  They were particularly upset with the provision that the order may
be renewed indefinitely by the arresting officer without any review
whatsoever.
In another piece of news from the Holy Land, Ha'aretz reported on the 24th
of October that Israeli soldiers are no longer being prosecuted for looting
and robbery in the areas of Lebanon controlled by the IDF.  Prosecutions
stopped after the end of the fighting in west Beirut.  The reason for this
is that looting is an offense only under the military code, and the
approriate section deals only with looting DURING A TIME OF FIGHTING, and
the fighting is over.  Of course, armed robbery is an offence under the
regular legal code in Israel, but Lebanon is outside Israel...  The news
item is quick to note that looting and armed robbery by Israeli soldiers in
Lebanon have NOT stopped.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After two or three days I already knew: something bad will happen here.  I
didn't imagine it would be this kind of a thing, but I was sure that
something, something, will happen.  When a whole unit becomes totally
depressed in 48 hours, the pressure starts and you know that somehow,
somewhere, the whole thing will blow up. (...)
You may say that this depression started because of the conditions (...) --
living in tents, field toilets stuck out in nowhere, shitty showers, and
food which was nothing but combat rations. (...).  All this takes away your
desire and your good mood immediately.  But always the question is also what
you do under these conditions.  What you are there for.  And this time we
in for it.
What is the single thing I will carry with me from this tour of reserve
duty, for a long, long time?  This feeling of the sharp smell emanating from
their camp, from the pens, the shine of the searchlights, and the noise of
the engines of the armored troop carriers circling among the pens at night.
Four damn hours in the guard tower:  You sit, lean the rifle aside, and look
down.  Seven thousand people in tents, milling around and whispering,
motioning.  (...).  Someone throws a rock wrapped with a note from one pen
to another, and someone else catches it there.
The armored troop carrier noisily travels the road between the pens, the
searchlights brightly color the tents, the images of the people going among
the tents.  And the smell, this horrible smell, of seven thousand sweating
bodies, of their stinking feces in the shitholes, of the chemicals thrown
into those holes to prevent sickness.  This smell that surrounds you
throughout the day and the night, sears your nostrils, accompanies you while
you're eating, while you're asleep and awake, until you get used to it and
accept it and it becomes part of you, and only when you return from leave
and approach the camp, and it hits you so hard, only then are you surprised
and a sense of nausea overcomes you, until you get used to it again.
They're called ``portees''.  Not prisoners, because they aren't legally
prisoners, not ``POWs'' because they aren't prisoners of war either.
``Portees''.  Why?  How should I know?  Because they were ported here, so
that's what they're called.  (...)  Seven thousand ``portees'' in an area
the size of a football field.  (...)
We're distant, guard them from afar, without any contact with them.  We only
know that if something happens, if they run towards the fences, if they
riot, we're supposed to open fire:  From the towers, from the lookouts, from
the armored carriers between the pens.
And so, eight hours a day, every day, every night, and a sort of depression
comes up from the pens and infects us, like the smell, and our faces
turn gray, and our mood becomes more somber, (...) and the mornings become
grayer and grayer.
On the second week some of us were taken off the watch towers and told to
man the roadblocks on the road to Nabatieh (...) to prevent the locals from
peeking at the camp.  At the beginning the happiness is great -- to get out
of the camp, away from the stinking and annoying mass of ``portees'', not to
hear the screams of pain of those being interrogated.  But even there, at
the roadblock, it turns out, it's no picnic.
(...)
Something always happens to ruin things -- after a few days, some women come
close to the camp.  Someone let them through.  What could we do?  What can
you do with women who come to you and start begging and kissing your hands
and crying and take out a picture of a young man with a moustache, in a suit
and tie, and ask you in tears if you've seen him, perhaps, in the camp?
They haven't seen him for three months.  Just disappeared.  At military HQ
in Saidon no one can tell her anything.  At the Red Cross they don't know.
Maybe he's in the camp after all?  She would like to walk by and have a
look.  Maybe she'll see him.  And maybe, maybe you can identify him?  And
again the photograph is shoved under your nose by a shaking hand.  Do you
know him?  He's my husband.  Do you know him?  Did you see him, there in the
camp?  Go tell her that you see them from afar and smell them from afar and
guard them from afar, and that for you they aren't human beings with a
moustache and a tie and a suit and with a wife at home and maybe kids, but
just a mass of seven thousand small ants milling around in blue uniforms at
day and in underwear at night.
So someone let them get close to the fence and there were shouts, and the
``portees'' got closer to the fences and the soldiers in the watchtowers and
on the ramps cocked their guns, and from the ``portees'' came the sound of
suppressed anger, and someone bent down and picked up a stone and threw it
at the soldiers, and soon there was a shower of rocks, and the soldiers
trained their guns on the crowd, which started excitedly moving towards the
fence, and someone fired into the air, and there was a scream, and the women
at the fence began to cry, and the ``portees'' shouted and by now were
running to the fence, and shaking it.
The soldiers were very confused.  And then came one of the MP officers --
the poor souls who, unlike ourselves who sit outside the camp, are actually
inside it, shaking from fright all the while, because they know that if
something serious takes place and we have to open fire on a massive scale,
we will hit them too.  Anyway, one of their officers stood up straight,
aimed his gun, and started shooting among the prisoners.  And we were
around, outside the fences, we watched dumbfounded how the bullets tore
people's flesh, and how the wounded pulled back suddenly and held onto the
place where they were hit and blood ran out from between their fingers and
stained their blue uniforms, and the wounded started falling to the ground
and screaming, one seemed dead, another started having convulsions, and
another obviously in great pain. (...)
And you hear now, every day, about a hand grenade thrown at a road block,
about a car driving up with a submachine gun firing from its window at the
soldiers manning the road block, and already you're afraid of every voice,
of the sound of every approaching car, and you grab your weapon and tense,
and slowly you learn to ignore the women who come to you with photographs
in their hands, and you drive them away and in your heart you fear that one
of them will take a grenade out from her dress.  Then you return to camp,
enter the tent (...) and the depression surrounds you again. (...)
If someone were to tell me that in one of the last days of the tour of
reserve duty someone would commit suicide, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But despite that, on the morning we were to be released, (...) while we
waited for the busses to come and take us away, when everything was behind
us, (...) -- it seemed unnecessary, out of place, tasteless.  But the shot
was fired.  And the man lay there, a large wound in his temple, blood
flowing freely out and bathing his surroundings, and his eyes staring
emptily up at the tent.
(...)
You know, in such cases, usually, after all the running around, and the
doctors and the medics, people start talking.  He did it because of this.
No, he did it because of that.  But this time -- nothing.  A sort of general
shrugging of the shoulders.  A few quiet whispers (...).  The first soldier
released from the camp, the first soldier to finish this tour of reserve
duty.
And we sit silently, waiting for the busses, and under us the crowd of
``portees'' is milling around, moving lazily near the fences.  And I watch
them and shiver for a moment, fear engulfs me, and I sense that there may
be some curse in them, which comes up to us together with their acrid smell,
and sows in each of us some dark seed, that sprouts in the darkness inside
of us.  A seed that sprouted too quickly in our suicide.

|	``I'll give you a demonstration,'' said Edward Johnson, 46, a
bespectacled computer consultant, pecking away at a keyboard in his
one-bedroom walk-up apartment here.
|	That activates his modem's auto-dailer. Bleep, bleep, bleep goes the
video arcade echo on his speaker phone as his Atari rings up Falwell's world
headquarters in Lynchburg, Va.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says an operator. ``Can I help you?''
|	Johnson grinned. His computer is programmed to tie up the line for 30
seconds, then it hangs up and dials again, as it has every 30 seconds, 24
hours a day, seven days a week, for the last eight months. ``Here we go
again,'' he said, and the computer dials 
1-800-446-5000
.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says the operator. ``Help you?'' Click.
|	``You can tell by the tone of voice they're not too happy,'' he said.
|	Indeed, Falwell officials estimate their first high-tech protester
cost them close to $1 million in lost pledges on a blessed WATS line, which
fields some 1 million calls a year, before Southern Bell detectives ordered
Johnson to hang up on Dec. 20 or face criminal charges -- using the telephone
to harass is a federal felony. The besieged switchboard raises at least half
of Falwell's $100 million budget, used to support a TV ministry, missionary
work, Bible study, an anti-abortion crusade and the like.
|	``He has robbed the poor and needy of many thousands of dollars,''
said Falwell in a press released that warned others who would do ``injury to
the cause of Christ by similar illegal acts.''
|	But Johnson accuses TV evangelists of persuading elderly viewers to
part with money they can ill afford to spend, buying religious trinkets and
false hope while the on-the-air preachers use their tax-free status to
subsidize and promote often incendiary views.
|	``They're making millions because there aren't any laws to protect the
gullible from such a powerful medium,'' said Johnson, who says he nearly lost
his family farm to TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggert.
|	After one rip-roaring TV sermon, he said, his 68-year-old mother, Mary
Johnson of Sylvester, was ready to sign over the family's 150 acres in south
Georgia. A virtual shut-in, she lives alone on land his father, who died 12
years ago, once planted with soybeans, peanuts and corn. But Johnston stepped
in and, along with an older brother, Raymond, talked her out of it.
|	``She once bought two Singer sewing machines from different salesmen
in the same week,'' he said.
|	Johnson's crusade began one Sunday morning, April 7, when, he
remembers, Jimmy Swaggert on a local affiliate accused gays of ``spreading
AIDS like flies'' at bathhouses.
|	A political activist and card-carrying member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, Johnson got angry. ``He was implying that you should treat
those people like flies,'' he said. He considered it unfair and inflammatory.
And, of course, he almost lost the farm.
|	He wrote the Federal Communications Commission to complain. He tapped
a second computer to mount a letter-writing campaign to congressmen and
senators. And he dispatched copies of those letters to Falwell, who had his
name. But it would take Falwell eight months to unearth Atari Central.
|	He targeted Falwell because he's the ``most politically active'' TV
evangelist, and his mother had sent him hundreds of dollars. ``If we get
Falwell, Swaggart will fall of his own weight,'' said Johnson, who is single
and lives alone.
|	Weaned on old-time religion growing up in Worth County, Ga., he joined
the Air Force out of high school, worked for a large computer firm as an
engineer, then settled into consulting.
|	He has nothing against religion, he says, but he compares his beliefs
more to Spinoza and Einstein than to fundamentalist TV preachers.
|	But what better way to protest than slow down their collection plate,
he argues. So he began dialing 1-800 ...
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' said the operator. ``Tap the phone if you
can hear me, honey. We'll pray for you.''
|	``At first,'' said Johnson, ``they thought I was deaf.''
|	For a time, he tried debating the operators to keep them busy. ``But
it was always, `God bless you,' or `God loves you.' They were so sweet, I kind
of felt sorry for them. They were programmed to be nice.''
|	So it was back to the computer. ``A computer is totally impersonal,''
he said. ``It can't feel sorry for you. It's relentless. It shows no mercy.''
|	Toward the end, operators were answering the dead lines: ``Edward
Johnson, is that you?''
|	They stopped thinking the caller was deaf.
|	``My computer kept the pressure on,'' he said. ``It had a great
demoralizing effect.''
|	On Nov. 15, Falwell officials reported trouble on the line. ``They
came to us with a simple technical problem,'' recalled Wayne Jackson, an AT&T
spokesman. ``They were getting hangups and lines jammed.''
|	Technicians ruled out a glitch and put on a tracer. It was touchy
going. Johnson's Atari was programmed to dial and hang up fast, to avoid
leaving fingerprints. But AT&T got its man.
|	On Dec. 17 ``we figured out it was coming from 404 area code,'' said
Jackson, and officials in Atlanta were alerted. Three days later, Southern
Bell security took over and Johnson was identified as the high priest of the
first church of Atari protest.
|	``It's amazing,'' said Richard Miles, a company spokesman. ``As big as
Atlanta is, within 30 minutes, we had tracked him down.'' The phone company
gave him a choice: stop calling Falwell or lose his telephone. Johnson pulled
his own plug.
|	Will Falwell take the Demon Dialer to court? ``Our attorneys are
considering the options,'' said Duane Ward, his PR director.
|	Before his computer sniping, Johnson protested such local issues as a
road for Jimmy Carter's presidential library that cut through his neighborhood
-- until demonstrators stopped it. From his window, he gazed at idled
earthmovers for inspiration, their cabs spray-painted, ``Long Live the
Trees!''
|	Suddenly Johnson, who once lived a life of quiet resignation, is,
however briefly, a media star. He attributes his inspiration to rage.
|	He says it's not over yet.
|	``I'm encouraging all hackers to reach out and touch Jerry Falwell,''
he said. ``If he's the Moral Majority, this is a good way of taking a vote.''","zx5yshZgQQkJ",1,1986-01-13,-17,13

				      ^^^^^^^^^
...
Allow me to correct a factual error in the above posting:
The deity known as ""Shiva"", is the third member of the Hindu Trinity, having
no bearing on Buddhism, which latter I understand to   ^^^^^
have been an atheistic (non-theistic perhaps?) path at the time of
its origin in India.  Shiva has no conceptual relationship with the
anthropomorphic Christian ""Damager-God"" being discussed in this newsgroup.
He does, however, represent destruction (not regarded as being inherently
evil or good), which is considered to be the third of the three phases that
Life is said to undergo (the other two being Creation and Growth,
represented respectively by Brahma and Vishnu, the other two Gods of the
Trinity). Shiva is also considered to be the masculine principle
(Purusha) in creation, the feminine being Nature (Prakriti).  Unfamiliar
though I am with the intricacies of the Yin/Yang notion, I would conjecture
that the Purusha/Prakriti interpretation is conceptually similar to
Yin/Yang. 
I hope this clears up some of the confusion and misinformation about
similarities between Judeo-Christian concepts of God/Satan and the Hindu
religio-philosophical concepts.

As I stated in my previous article, much of the unhappiness of gay people,
evident in the above symptoms, is due to the oppression we suffer rather
than being intimately connected to homosexuality.  As for how I can live
""this way"", I cannot live any other way than gay.  ""Why?"" you ask, so that
the gay people who come after me don't have to suffer such shit.  Finally,
a sample size of ""20 or so"" is a very small sample to base such a judgement
on out of the 30,000,000 or so homosexuals in the United States... obviously
most of the homosexuals that you have met didn't trust you enough to mention
it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	It is very true that homosexuals are oppressed, but let's not
exaggerate this. Most of those I have known were hardly 'oppressed'
compared to many other groups in our society; they were often very successful
nevertheless unhappy. You are blaming somewhat their personal dissatisfaction
upon the larger society, which simply does disagree about the morality of this,
even though it is fairly tolerant. I am saying you are not very objective.
The fact is that a lot of their psychological problems are caused by the same
unconscious motives which cause many of them to be promiscuous. Many are 
slaves to their own promiscuous sexuality, which cannot make them emotionally
secure.
	Besides this, I have heard a number of experts in public health,
concerned with the AIDS infection, observe that the physical health of 
homosexuals as a group is not very good because of their transient lifestyles,
and very high rate of infection of all kinds of diseases, which is due to
promiscuity. Contradict them, but I accept their opinion as specialists
who objectively know as much as anyone.
	You are probably right that my experience is limited. However, I
am interested in people, and they do talk to me in a way that they might
not to others. I met very few of these at parties (You or Dave Trisell
remarked on this.); I met them either when I worked as a laborer, or
as a university student or researcher, or I met them at church, or at
political events, or they were neighbors. They were pretty ordinary.

You forget that 15% of *all* men are gay or bisexual, actually I doubt you
forget, but wish to conviently brush the facts aside.  You are right about
the fact that many non-gays recommend against a gay lifestyle, *mostly due
to Christian spread intolerence* however.  I don't even recommend it, if one
can be straight, one may save ones life, job, home and health by not being
gay and thereby incurring the wrath of bigots.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I did not mention your percentages, because my point was that
homosexuality is not accepted among other very large non-Christian cultures,
which are far more sexually repressive than this ""Christian"" culture.
Listen, I am handicapped; I know what is prejudice, probably better than
you, because my handicap is obvious. But I am careful not to label people
who disagree with me, but would not harm me. I don't even dislike you
a little bit. But I disagree.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>representative of most homosexuals?
Yes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you have stayed with the same person for 5 years as you say,
I doubt that you are representative, although you would seem to be
satisfied.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>	We all want to have secure relationships with others; the question
>is -- what sort of relationship are we securing? Is it to be recommended
>to young people? Whether or not it is 'voluntary', is it to be recommended?
15% of all male children will grow up to be gay/bisexual.  Is it healthy
to teach children that the life they will lead is somehow sick, evil, etc?
No.  Isn't this a method of making sure that they will have problems for the
rest of their lives?  Yes.  Will it change their orientation to tell them
such things?  No.  Will some of the larger percentage of children that
aren't gay take these concepts about gays and use them to justify going
out and ""bashing queers"" and otherwise denying gays human rights.  Yes.
Do you wish to continue the cycle?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You have posed a dilemma which does not exist, as I see it.
It is my opinion that the genetic basis for homosexuality must be very
weak, since homosexuals will not reproduce relatively often (nothing like 15%).
This suggests to me that the initial determination of homosexuality is very 
much socially 'circumstantial', but that it is quickly 'imprinted' by the very
powerful sexual drive. (I notice you do not quote Masters and Johnson, who
have no bias, but found that sexual response is conditioned, but sometimes
reversible even among adults. This caused them a lot of very abusive political
trouble.) I am not suggesting that homosexuality is determined by simple
social 'circumstances', of family or otherwise. But you should appreciate how
little we are really informed of the consequences of childhood relationships; 
for example, a very large percentage of rapists and postitutes have unsatis-
factory childhood relationships. My point is that these circumstances are
often very far from satisfying to those involved, and they have consequences.
	If people had more stable, loving families, in which the love of
the parents for each other was manifest, I doubt that there would be even
a small fraction of what you suggest.
	As I've repeatedly said, anyone who persecutes anyone is not a
Christian, by the simple definition that Christ did not condemn anyone.

Perhaps the Christians who used it that way were enlightened.  Some
Christians today are enlightened, but certainly you are not one of those.
Quit trying to use some obscure definition of the word enlighten as
*the* definition.  What enlightened me, by the way, was having to
live with prejedice every day of my life.  Since one of the major
teachings of JC that I still believe and use in my own religious/moral
code, is that you should love your neighbor as yourself.  Since I do
not like prejedice against myself, I assume that my neighbor doesn't
either.  Therefore, I try to enlighten others, like you, who are in
need of enlightenment.

	Perhaps I should not have said anything about this, but it is
you who was first talking about who is or is not 'enlightened' (even in the
conclusion of the previous article to which this reply was made). I was
pointing out that you may not be baptized in Christ, and that this is
true 'enlightenment', no matter what you think. And as Jesus said,
""Everyone who sins, is a slave to sin."" But this should make us more
merciful.
	If you love your neighbor as yourself, then you are not far from
being a Christian. But I disagree about the matter at hand. But again I
also agree that there are good Christians who do not believe that
homosexuality is a sin. (but it is not this opinion which makes them
good Christians; it is the fact of their helpfulness, and unwillingness
to see anyone harmed.) I might add, though, that most of these privately
would prefer that no one was homosexual.
	I agree that we all have a lot to learn.

Stoning was only done for a very few and specific acts.  As far as I have
been able to determine homosexuality was not one of these.  If you have
other information please define its source (chapter and verse of the
Bible will be sufficient).  By all of the studies, 6% to 15% of all men
are homosexual *irreguardless of race, religion, or time in history*.
Thus your above arguement is bogus horseshit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	(I definitely do not agree with punishment of homosexuals; I am
rebutting your contention about Jewish law; I have consulted an Orthodox
friend who is a rabbinical student.) Translation from NEB.
	Lev.18.22. You shall not lie with a man as with a woman: that is
an abomination (an expression for a most grave sin).
	Lev.18.29,30. for anyone who does any of these abominable things
shall be cut off from his people. Observe the charge, therefore, and follow
none of the abominable institutions customary before your time.
	Lev.20.13. If a man has intercourse with a man as with a woman, they
both commit an abomination. They shall be put to death; their blood shall be
on their own hands.
	There are four punishments by death, according to the offense: stoning
to death is considered to be the least severe.
	You should consult an Orthodox authority concerning the interpretation
of Jewish Law, if you want to understand their tradition.
	I did not say what you would have, but said ""it is very probable that
Jesus never came across a persecuted homosexual Jew, there were so few.""
I said nothing about estimates of proportions of homosexuals in various
cultures; besides, this is very speculative. What I said is that it was
considered to be an 'abomination' among the Jews, punishable by death. Jesus
was very probably a public figure for one year (and no more than three years);
as I said, in this repressive society, Jesus very well might not have met
a public example of 'a persecuted homosexual Jew' during his ministry. Recall
that disciples who knew about his ministry wrote the Gospels; he did not
write anything himself. They do report the account of the adulterous woman,
which gives his attitude toward both sexual sins and toward the Law: he
reminds us that we have all sinned; he does not condemn her; he tells her
to stop sinning. That is, he rejects the mercilessness of the old law, and
the hypocrisy of those who would condemn others with punishment.
	(I have never met 'a persecuted homosexual', as such, even in this
fairly open society. I've seen them on television, but I've never met one.
I have demonstrated in Austin, Texas against proposals of housing laws 
which discriminate against homosexuals. There was no TV in Jesus day, his
society was repressive, and he seems to be very busy with those who sought
him out or whom he encountered.)
	As for your contentions about modern foreign cultures, you seem to
be very uninformed by their members. I work in a research institute in which
we have literally dozens of visitors every year from all over the world:
China, Taiwan, India, Australia, Italy, Israel, East Germany, Finland,
Japan, France, Iran, from all over the world. I have been informed that
homosexuality is very uncommon and unaccepted among the very largest cultures.
You may say that is because they are repressive, so that homosexuals do not
disclose themselves publicly, but that is not my point: it is not publicly
common or even privately accepted in these cultures. It is here and in some
more tolerant countries. But their 'repressiveness' has nothing to do with
Christianity, and you are denigrating their cultural values if you insist
upon this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>	As for his other attitudes about sexuality, they are very clear.
>First, he says marriage may interfere with ministry, but does not insist
You seem to be confusing Jesus and Paul (Saul) here.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Of course not. 
	Paul does make some recommendations. But read Matthew where Jesus
says some are celibate for the sake of the kingdom of God, but he does not
insist upon this. (see a commentary) By the way, apparently the contemporary
Essene monks were celibate, while the Pharisaic rabbis were married of course.
But this, as well as his own unmarried state, may have prompted this exchange.
(The Essenes were extremely ascetic and pious; however this may be, they were
not merciful to sinners, and their ethical teachings were not like those of
Jesus.)

I've never been married to a woman.  Does this mean that I shouldn't break
up with my lover of five years.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Of course not; do you reason like this all the time? He presupposes
the divine provision of heterosexual mating, period. There is no provision
for homosexuality at all; this would undermine the sanctity of the other.

As I stated in my previous article, much of the unhappiness of gay people,
evident in the above symptoms, is due to the oppression we suffer rather
than being intimately connected to homosexuality.  As for how I can live
""this way"", I cannot live any other way than gay.  ""Why?"" you ask, so that
the gay people who come after me don't have to suffer such shit.  Finally,
a sample size of ""20 or so"" is a very small sample to base such a judgement
on out of the 30,000,000 or so homosexuals in the United States... obviously
most of the homosexuals that you have met didn't trust you enough to mention
it.

You forget that 15% of *all* men are gay or bisexual, actually I doubt you
forget, but wish to conviently brush the facts aside.  You are right about
the fact that many non-gays recommend against a gay lifestyle, *mostly due
to Christian spread intolerence* however.  I don't even recommend it, if one
can be straight, one may save ones life, job, home and health by not being
gay and thereby incurring the wrath of bigots.

Yes.

15% of all male children will grow up to be gay/bisexual.  Is it healthy
to teach children that the life they will lead is somehow sick, evil, etc?
No.  Isn't this a method of making sure that they will have problems for the
rest of their lives?  Yes.  Will it change their orientation to tell them
such things?  No.  Will some of the larger percentage of children that
aren't gay take these concepts about gays and use them to justify going
out and ""bashing queers"" and otherwise denying gays human rights.  Yes.
Do you wish to continue the cycle?

Perhaps the Christians who used it that way were enlightened.  Some
Christians today are enlightened, but certainly you are not one of those.
Quit trying to use some obscure definition of the word enlighten as
*the* definition.  What enlightened me, by the way, was having to
live with prejedice every day of my life.  Since one of the major
teachings of JC that I still believe and use in my own religious/moral
code, is that you should love your neighbor as yourself.  Since I do
not like prejedice against myself, I assume that my neighbor doesn't
either.  Therefore, I try to enlighten others, like you, who are in
need of enlightenment.

JC never mentions homosexuals in any context.  Paul, however, was not
a freethinker in any respect, and followed the Jewish legal tradition
quite strongly.  He may have been adding some these sorts of personal
prejudgements to his discourses (on totally different subjects).  That
is why such prejudgements need to reexamined periodically.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i. Paul's 'personal prejudgments' were, rather, traditional.
ii. It is 'personal prejudgment' to have Paul say what he plainly
	does not.
iii. Paul was 'freethinking' for his time, but this does not mean
	he would agree with anything we would like. Although he was
	formerly the student of a famous Pharisaic teacher, his
	understanding of Scripture and human psychology is remarkably
	'modern'; certainly his interpretations of Scripture are very
	figurative, instead of simply literal. Also, he did set aside
	many rules of traditional Jewish ritual Law, which he believed
	were less important ethically and theologically, which might
	cause non-Jews to stumble, so that they might listen to the
	Gospel. Finally, Paul said that while Christians had been
	set free by Christ, still not all things were good for them.
iii. Jesus cites Scripture that man and woman were created by God
	for each other. This is the traditional Jewish view, which one
	can misconstrue only if one is very obstinate.
iv. Jesus was not condemnatory of any sins, but merciful, so that
	all men, being sinners, might come to repentance. It is
	mercifulness, rather than vengeance, which leaves open the
	possibility of repentance. Vengeance hardens our hearts.
v. The primary point is that if Jesus had approved, even privately,
	of homosexuality, no matter what is recorded in the NT
	writings, this would have been so scandalous to the
	contemporary Jewish society, notably to the religious leaders,
	that we would certainly be informed about it according to
	orthodox Jewish tradition. I stand on this.
vi. I should say that my purpose in making these observations is
	to make clear that no one can plausibly suggest that Jesus,
	or Paul, approved of homosexuality. However, Jesus certainly
	did not persecute anyone. And those who do are not like him.
vii. Faith is said to be a gift of God, but for those who would
	desire it. Jesus could only heal the spiritual afflictions
	of those who sought his help, who would desire faith, as in
	the saying, ""Lord, help my unbelief,"" and the ultimate
	petition of Mass, based on the faithful petition even of a
	Gentile centurion, ""Lord, I am not worthy to recieve you, but
	only say the word, and I shall be healed.""
viii. I believe that the churches should help to secure the human rights
	of all individuals, including rights to assembly, speech, religion,
	voting, employment, and housing. I believe that homosexuals should 
	not be excluded from congregations, anymore than are sexually
	promiscuous persons. And although they may elect to exclude them-
	by a sort of self-excommunication, the consequences of enforced
	separation may be harmful to someone who would otherwise change
	in the course of time and fellowship. We should be patient, rather
	than condemnatory; by excluding or persecuting others, we are
	condemning them, since therefore they cannot not come to change.
viii.Most Christians simply believe that God has created mankind with the
	intention of heterosexuality; one may not believe in the divine
	creation, but our anatomy and reproduction alone suggest very strongly
	that evolution has selected for phenotypic heterosexuality -- other-
	wise we would suffer self-extinction very quickly. For someone who
	does believe in creation by God, he must also faithfully believe 
	that the means of this creation, including our heterosexual
	reproduction, is good, even if we cannot forsee yet what is the 
	fulfillment of creation. My point is that a religious view of nature 
	is religious, and not purely existential as if the only purposes
	were our own.
ix. I believe that you must surely understand what I've said, even if 
	you disagree with my views, or with those of Jesus or Paul, so 
	that there is no reason to falsely characterize what I have said.
	What I object to is a view which misrepresents the ethical teachings
	of the NT for the sake of a prejudice, and furthermore expects that
	the churches should approve of behavior which is considered to be
	a sin according to Christian as well as precedent Jewish tradition.

I question the use of most in the above paragraph.  Do you mean most
Christians?  If so, while potentially true, this is the very point
that we are pushing to have reexamined.  Do you mean most cultures?
This is not true.  Do you mean most people today?  This is the work
of the Christian Church, and demonstrates why this belief must be
changed.  As for homosexuality being self-destructive, that is an
opinion you seem to hold that has no justifications here.  Prove it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As you already first observe, and as the context suggests,
""most"" means ""most of the living body of Christians.""
	Do I have to prove this to you? Do you yourself want to live
as a large proportion of homosexuals do?
	I am simply giving my opinion based on discussion with homosexual
individuals, 20 or so, over 20 years, also based on listening to televised
discussions by physicians who are said to be expert. My impression is
that the rates of suicide, drug abuse, promiscuity, transience, infection,
and death are considerably higher among this population than among non-
homosexual groups, especially married persons. Certainly, the health and
happiness of those with whom I talked was not good, even according to them.
The thing I always wondered was -- how can you live this way? And why?
	If you do not believe me, then ask your doctor to recommend 
unbiased physicians at a medical school who are expert in public health.
Then report this survey to the Net.
	You should understand that nearly everyone who is not homosexual,
not matter how liberal or religious, recommends against this life. Further-
more, as I have been informed by Indian and Chinese friends, who are from
ancient countries representing 1/3 of world population, homosexuality is
not accepted, and rare among these comparatively restrictive cultures. 
Neither do Muslim nations, who represent another very large proportion, 
accept this. All these tradtionally reject it. One has to go back to 
pagan Greek and Roman days to find such widespread acceptance. You are
very mistaken.

You seem to believe that all or most gays live their lives in bathhouses,
and I have to say that that belief is completely incorrect.  Unless
you had friends and/or aquaintances who were openly gay, your big city
experiences with gays have been confined to people who were out partying.
Isn't making a judgement on such a skewed sample a little brash?  I mean,
I'm involved in a relationship that has been ongoing for 4 1/2 years.
I supported my lover through school.  Many gays are actively involved
in charity efforts, upgrading their neighborhoods, politicing for
minority rights, etc.; are these self-destrutive?  I know lots of
gays in stable relationships (just to point out that I am not a strange
exception).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I said what I meant: here I am addressing the general problem of 
promiscuity, whether it is heterosexual or homosexual. Of course, I am
not commenting on where you can find it.
	Like you also, I believe that all of us are capable of doing good,
and of responding to the needs of others. But we do this because we
are human with conscience, not because we are gay or not, perfect or
not. You are saying that gays are human beings capable of good, and I
completely agree that none of us should forget this.
	If you and your friends are not 'promiscuous', then are you really
representative of most homosexuals?
	We all want to have secure relationships with others; the question
is -- what sort of relationship are we securing? Is it to be recommended
to young people? Whether or not it is 'voluntary', is it to be recommended?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While I do not contend that all gays are of benefit to their communities,
I do contend that statements such as those in the above paragraph are at
best unsubstantiated dreck, and are more likely to be considered
rabble-rousing and hate mongering.  Because while you claim to be so
enlightened as to not persecute gays, it is a short step from ""they
are self-destructive"" to ""we must protect them from themselves so
that they can be saved"" to ""put gay people in concentration camps so
that they don't infect our children"" by people not as enlightened as
you claim to be.

	There are two points made in my article, one about Christian 
tradition, the other about my opinion. You dislike my opinion, which
is that homosexuality is self-destructive, that it should not be
approved by the churches, but that no one should persecute anyone,
but treat everyone as an individual who has fallen short, but is
capable of change for the better.
	I've found good qualities in almost everyone, but I would
certainly not recommend everyone's life to others.
	I am not speaking to rabble -- I am speaking to you, without
compromise but also without aspersion. Those who would persecute
others will find no encouragement in what I say, unless they would
distort what I've said. We should always keep in mind what Jesus
said about the adulterer: consider that you who would condemn
this one are also sinners; I have not condemned this one; the one
should stop sinning. This was the new, more merciful commandment
which, it is said, he stooped to write on the earth with his
finger, even as it is said that the Lord God descended at Sinai to
write with His finger on the stone tablets of men's hearts.
	Being homosexual as you are, also does not make you very
'enlightened' I'm afraid. Besides this, it almost certainly does not
mean the same thing to you as it does to me. To begin with, it is

	I shook up anybody too much.  
	     I learned a long time ago that to hold a firm Conservative line
	is extremely difficult.  There are people in the world who cannot stand
	to have their philosophies criticized.  It is difficult at best to not
	take personnally the vitriolic attacks I have received about my 
	beliefs.  People have called me a Nazi/Communist, a bigot, a racist,
	an anarchist, etc.  All I want to see happen is a return to the 
	priciples of God's laws and covenants as laid out in Scripture and
	codified in the Constitution of the United States.  (Now, if anybody
	has a fear of the Constitution, then baby, you got PROBLEMS!)
	     Regarding my comments on homosexuality:  If God wanted us to be
	homosexual, He would have created Adam and Eve and Bruce  (My humble
	apologies to the ""Bruces"" of the world).  My Scripture tells me that
	homosexuality is an abomination not to be tolerated.  Out of fairness,
	to me that means that these people do have the right to their homes,
	livlihood, careers, front-seats-on-the-bus, medical treatment, etc.
	It does not say that I have to associate with them socially, let
	them teach my children, let them preach off my pulpit, or let them
	donate blood.  Scripture also tells me that God did in Sodom because
	of the city's sexual preferences.  You cannot convince me that AIDS
	and herpes are not God's warnings to certain people to ""cease and
	desist.""  To ask me to believe otherwise is to ask me to cease 
	believing in Scripture.  
	     To Ken Arndt:
	     Thanks for your support, Ken.  I'm always open to commentary.
	I'll have to take the time to look up those books you mentioned.
	I do believe that most of the mainstream churches have not fully
	realized the implications of their liberal leanings.  It is only
	in the last couple of years, for example, that the Roman Catholic
	Church has realized the demand for the celebration of Mass in Latin.
	The Lutheran Church has similar problems because of its change in
	the services.  The various synods foisted that ridiculous green
	tome on us to replace the hymnal that has served for decades if
	not centuries.  (And certain synods who subscribe to the National
	Council of Churches have ceased following certain key passages
	in the Book of Concord.  Would you believe, they actually advocate
	reconciliation with Rome?)  My consolation is the great upsurge
	in the congregations of the various Fundamentalist churches
	such as the Assembly of God, Bible Baptists, etc.  (And even 
	better, the increase in the number of Christian politicians.
	For example, the first time I met Congressman Bob Smith [R-NH]
	was at a service at the Assembly of God Church in Rochester.)
	     To Jeff Sonntag and Rich Rosen:
	     Come now, gentlemen!  Do you never read the newspapers?  Or
	can I assume that the Comintern has abandoned its stated goal of
	the abolition of religion?  Ahhh, I suppose you want me to believe
	that there is freedom of religion in the Soviet Union.  Well, yeah,
	maybe--but why are there only about sixty churches in Moscow today,
	when there were over six hundred before the Glorious People's 
	Revolution?  Urban renewal perchance?  Anywhere the Soviets place their
	filthy heel, religion is the first element of society to be eliminated.
	And this not only applies to Christians.  Look what happened in 
	Tibet.  The Buddhist monasteries were closed and sacked, and the
	monks either murdered, imprisoned, or exiled.  Show me a Communist
	who wouldn't want to do the same thing in this nation.
	     In this country, one of the greatest enemies of religion is the
	Rockefeller-supported National Educational Association.  This group
	managed to gain control of the Indiana state legislature, and 
	passed legislation regarding the necessity to certify teachers who
	work in private schools.  Naturally, they required the certification to
	be to NEA standards.  So when the local fundamentalist Baptist Church
	opened a Christian school, along comes the NEA to control it.  Since
	the NEA demanded that the school use Humanist textbooks (among other
	things) the school refused to use certified teachers.  The result
	was that Pastor Siliven and six others spent time in jail and paid
	out many thousands of dollars in fines and attorneys' fees, all
	for the principle of Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Speech.
	Recently the State of Indiana saw the error of its ways, and 
	vindicated the parties concerned.  
	     There are other very subtle ways to discourage the practice of
	religion.  For example, certain communities have zoning laws that
	prohibit the use of a structure as a church if that structure is in
	an area zoned for residential use only.  After all, a church is a
	commercial business, you understand.  So, while it is OK for a 
	Communist cell to discuss Marxism in somebody's living room,
	a group cannot legally gather to pray or study Scripture, because
	to do so is construed as holding a church service.
	     The Constitution clearly states that Congress shall pass no
	law recognizing the establishment of a religion, nor prohibiting the
	free exercise thereof.  (My, how we tend to ignore the second half of
	that sentence!)  But yet, who determines what constitutes a ""religion""
	in this nation?  Why, none other than that bastion of freedom, the
	Internal Revenue Service!  If you want to open a church, which is
	your right, you must apply to the IRS to be certified as a religion
	in order to gain tax-exempt status.  You don't believe me?  Write to
	them and ask.  They'll close you down and seize your assets if you
	try to claim income tax deductions unless they give you permission
	to be a church.
	     The A.C.L.U. is another ""good buddy"" of religion.  A creche in
	Providence is insulting but a menorah on the Boston Common is not
	(Whoops--careful, Black, you're going too far!).  I see an awful lot
	of atheist businessmen laughing all the way to the bank during the
	Christmas holidays.  Would you like to read a real eye-opener?
	Read ""My Life Without God"" by William Murray.  Bill is the son of the
	great atheist theologian, Madalyn Murray O'Hare.  Irony of ironies, 
	Bill became a fundamentalist preacher, and he heads an organization 
	that is trying to reverse the trend that his mother started.
	     For those of you who like ""War Stories,"" I'd recommend the

I won't quibble about the Bill of Rights being an amendment to the
constitution (in #2).  It was clearly intended by the framers of the
constitution.  (I recall that at the time of the ratification of the
constitution, it was agreed that a bill of rights would be added later.)
Thus, it squarely contradicts #1 and #3.  Now, the error could be in
the constitution being contradictory or in Don's ideas.  Guess which I'd
pick?

Here we have a classic example of putting the cart before the horse.
Anybody may open a church.  No questions asked.  You may call anything you
like a religion.  There is one major reason why the government might be
interested in what constitutes a religion: tax exempt status.  Tax-exempt
staus is not required to open a church nor to run a church.  As a matter
of fact, JC was explicit about taxes: render up to Caesar that which
is Caesar's.  JC did not have church property or taxable income.  Now I
suppose it's a bit much to ask Christians and their priests or ministers
to follow that example.  :-)
So how do you propose determining who is granted tax exemption?

God and Scripture are NEVER mentioned in the Constitution.  God is mentioned 
(I think once) in the Declaration of Independence.  Jefferson, Adams, Monroe 
and many of the other framers felt that it was unconstitutional for their to 
be a Congressional Chaplain, much the less a state church.  
Please cite your references for codification of religious principles in the

What's the passage in scripture that refers to cold sores?  What
is the behavior of the hundreds of heterosexual victims of AIDS
in Africa that they must ""cease and desist""?  Kindly clarify.

This could also be construed as a powerful argument that
churches and religious organizations should be subject to
taxation exactly the same as any other profit-making
organization, or should be subject to exactly the same
""educational/non-profit"" criteria for tax exemption as secular
organizations.  In other words, we agree that the State SHOULD
NOT be in the business of determining what constitutes a *bona
fide* religion.  Of course, nobody is stopping you from
starting a church *without* tax-exempt status.

It's most likely a viral infection, spread by a variety of mechanisms
including sexual contact.  Although the gay community has had a higher
incidence of it to date, cases have been reported among heterosexual
partners of infected individuals.  This in turn raises the likelihood
of eventual spread to the population as a whole, with incidence patterns
similar to other sexually transmitted diseases.

	AIDS is a disease transmitted through the blood.   It is thus
a venereal disease and, like gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes, no fun
for anyone.   Needless to say, there is nothing one can do which is
completely safe -- pregnancy, for example, is even more of a risk to
the woman's life than is an abortion.
	I think that whoever posted the original article (which I didn't
see) merely meant that the intention and usual result of homosexual
encounters is not to hurt the other person [well, unless that's what
they want, I suppose].   This doesn't mean there is no harm done or
risk taken, just that it is not unusually high -- excepting very
promiscuous people, who are taking a risk no matter what their sexual
preferences are.

This is false. The gay community (in the New York area, at least) has been
most active in promoting and adopting safe sex guidelines that slow down the
spread of the disease. Indeed, health statistics over the last six months
or so indicate that the greatest percentage of new cases are transmitted
by infected intraveinous drug users sharing dirty needles or from heterosexual
sexual relations with prostitutes (who have a large intersection with the
drug user population.) In fact, health professionals in this area are emphatic:
AIDS is no longer exclusively, nor even primarily a ""gay disease;""
As for the recent Supreme Court ruling, by Justice White's argument that
there exists a strong tradition in the law and in the culture for anti-sodomy
laws, racism, slavery and segregation would still be the law of the land.
Remember the ""but biblical figures had slaves"" areguments? Is Justice
WHite intent on repealing the Fourteenth Amendment? Why are gays not
entitled to the same rights as everyone else (since the decision specifically
does not address heterosexual sodomy)?
All in all, I cannot help but agree with Justice Blackmun's dissent that
""only the most willfull blindness"" denies that consensual sexual activity
is covered by the basic right to privacy.

Anyway, I do have a question about the original posting.
What's the criterion that's used for distinguishing between
'possibly safe' and 'safe' acts? Are 'possibly safe' acts
ones that have not caused any known cases of aids but may
as far as we know lead to transmission of the virus? Or what?

These are the results of the first Usenet {net,mod}.singles readers survey.
Respons was, to put it mildly, amazing. I was expecting between 50 and 60
responses, I got 150. Because of that, I decided not to do some of the
things I'd hoped to do, such as add in specific comments from people. Many
people had some very interesting things to say that don't show up in the
raw figures below, but sheer volume made me cut this stuff out. Total
response on this came out to about half a megabyte of mail. My thanks to
everyone who took the time to respond to this, and to be as open as you
were about it.

How to read this survey: Editorial comments will be surrounded by square
brackets. The number of people who made a specific response is noted by the
number in parenthesis. Some questions I removed all responses that were
made only once to make the size of the article tolerable-- it seems that
there is at least one person on the net who likes something, but not
neccessarily two *grin*. If you have further questions or comments, feel
free drop me a line at ..!nsc!chuqui  or nsc!chu...@decwrl.arpa.
1) what is your name?
	[ data not compiled-- for some reason every answer was different!]
	[many people also answered the questions 'what is your quest?' and
	 'what is your favorite color?'-- the search for the holy grail and
	 blue seemed to be the most popular answers]
2) sex
119 - male
 31 - female
[ yes was not an appropriate response. popular, but not appropriate. As
expected, there is a strong imbalance of bodies on the net, mainly because
the computer industry is still heavily male oriented. It isn't as bad as I
thought it might be, though]
3) Age
(male)	(female)
  6 	   1	- <20
 42 	  11	- 20-25
 38 	  11	- 26-30
 19 	   7	- 31-35
  9 	   0	- 36 - 40
  3 	   0	- >40
[ the youngest was in their mid-teens, the oldest in his 60's. The average
age seems to be about 23-24 for men, and 26-27 for women]
4) Profession
administrative assistant, cad/cam designer, communications tech
computer consultant, computer engineer, computer nerd
computer operator, computer scientist(3), design scientist
digital signal processing researcher, ee(2), electronic tech(2)
employee development, engineer(2), hardware design, human factors consultant
ic designer(2), manager, manager of software engineering, marketeer
mechanical engineer, member technical staff(4), military strategy analyst
model builder, professor, programmer(49), software consultant
software designer(4), software engineer(12), student consultant(3)
student(56), system administrator(5), system programmer(7), system support
system engineer(4), tech pubs manager, technical instructor, technical writer(3)
training, unix tinkerer, walking reference manual, world war one flying ace
writer
[many people had more than one thing they called themselves-- I used all of
them as applicable (especially for things like student/programmer). I
should have split out grad students separately, I think. Although it
doesn't show here, women seemed to be more likely to be in non-technical or
perepherally technical positions rather than hardcore programming]
5) Where do you live?
canada(8), east(30), midwest(32), northeast(26), northwest(14)
rocky mountains(2), south(4), southwest(5), west(29)
6) Where did you grow up?
australia, canada(8), east(25), germany, hawaii, india(2), midwest(25)
military brat(9), northeast(24), northwest(5), pacific northwest
rocky mountain, south(4), southwest(7), west(29)
[ my apologies to the canadians for pretending they don't exist-- this data
should have been split out much better than it was-- once I realized this I
was too far into it to go back and restart. Many people made comments such
as 'new jersey' or 'chicago' as their region, and it would have been
interesting (in retrospect) to not only look at where people live, but how
they view the area they live in (a number of people mentioned 'New York' as
being an area all to its own, for example). I punted canadian provinces
completely, unfortunately. sigh]
6) Current Status
attached(10), divorced(4), engaged(4), married(14), separated(4), single(107)
[It is interesting to see how people view themselves-- if you are divorced,
do you consider yourself divorced or single (again)? This can give you (and
me) a perspective on how you see yourself. As expected, the single group
dominated, for some reason. I probably should have broken it down in the
question to single/happy and single/dating single/attached, etc... because
some people commented they were happily single and some people commented
they were not so happily single-- it would have been interesting to break
down those as well...]
7) Sexual Preference (1 to 6)
1 [heterosexual](133)
2 (6)
3 (4)
6 [homosexual] (4)
[The numbers, for those that asked, are the Kinsey scale, used to rate
relative sexual preferences. I hadn't expected things to be quite as biased
towards string heterosexuality, but it may be that people are a little wary
to discuss that information on a public net with a relative stranger (or
even a chuqui, for that matter... *grin*). My thanks to those that did
overcome their hesitance to discuss this openly]
8) Do you read net.singles, mod.singles, or both?
both(93)
mod.singles(23)
net.singles(21)
[mod.singles is still an open issue whether or not it will really succeed.
we'll see. Most people are keeping an open mind on it]
9) What do you want to see in mod.singles?
anecdotes(4), avoiding boredom in a relationship, being single
dating(3), dealing with gender differences and prejudices
dealing with rejection(2), dealing with women
discussion of separations and divorce(2), economic aspects of relationships
finding and keeping love, finding compatible mates, friendships
friendships vs. love relationships, getting rid of stereotypes
how people arrived at self-acceptance, interpreting signals
joys of being single, life as a non-married(2)
marriage vs. living together, meeting new people(5)
meeting parents, meeting people, multiple relationships
new forms of entertainment, non-offensive humor, party notices
practical aspects of a relationship, psychological aspects of relationships
real day to day concerns, relating experiences, relating to people

short messages, shyness, sincere questions, single life(4)
singles experiences, singles issues, social typing, socializing
tactfully approaching MOTAS, understanding MOTOS viewpoints
understanding each other(2), unusual predicaments in relationships
where girls hang out, whether or not to live together
10) what don't you want to see in mod.singles?
abuse, abortion(16), ads, ann landers type discussions
anything that belongs in another group, birth control
computer generated drivel(5), condemnation of other lifestyles
creationism, drugs, dull discussions, endless repetition(8)
feminist intolerance, flaming(12), gay issues(2), grammar

how to pick up girls/ where to meet them, insults, interacial sex
judgements of others lifestyles, man/woman hating, marital aids(2)

media hype, mistreatment of the opposite sex, moral issues(2)
neuroses, non-single related postings, personality conflicts, politics(7)
rape(2), religion(22), sex, sexism, sexual preferences, sexual relationships
spillover from other groups(8), stuff that belongs in other groups
why doesn't my pickup line work
[These comments are just as valuable for net.singles, I think, and we
should keep them in mind when posting in the future. It is obvious that a
lot of people aren't interested in listening to topics that belong
elsewhere-- this includes abortion (net.abortion) religion (net.religion.?)
and the like. the intolerance of some people and the flaming that goes on
because of it is also a big downer to people. What I'm hearing is that the
readers want us to lower our voices and talk, not yell, and to be more
careeful about where we are posting things]
12) How often do you post?
bi-monthly(2), bi-weekly(3), continuously(2), daily(19), frequently
monthly(4), never(8), occasionally(68), once(3), rarely(4), seldom(3)

trb, woodstock, yehoyaqim shemtob martillo
[I decided there was no way of publishing the 'who you like least' section
without offending people on the list. It is fairly safe to say that a good
percentage of the people on the most list also made it on the least list
(myself included, of course) mainly, it seems, because the people you
respect the most or least are the ones who go out on a limb and either
stands up or falls over. Many of these people got multiple votes, but I
didn't want to turn this into a popularity contest-- everyone on the list
above got one (or more) votes from people who thought their words well far
enough above the average to be worth mentioning. I ignored people who
voted for themselves (although they were more likely to vote AGAINST
themselves... Everyone up there, take a bow]

both things I probably should have totaled. Many others watch tv, but
aren't entirely comfortable admitting to some of the things they watch
('this is junk, but... *blush*'). Usenet readers seem to really buck the
national trends in tv-- they watch less, and watch the thought provoking
tv. things mentioned only once were removed for brevity]

Where have you been?
Speaking of AIDS: I've heard conflicting stories about AIDS. Can anyone with
RELIABLE information feed it back to the net?

following points emerged from our talk:
1. It is currently most predominant in homosexuals, BUT it is beginning
   to spread to non-homosexuals.
2. Transmission methods seem to involve some bodily secretion, including
   saliva.
3. She said that it could be acquired from DRY, but contaminated,
   toilet seats up to 90 minutes after the contamination!
4. A very fatal form of skin cancer can occur in victims.
5. Your best defense at present is to practice good personal hygiene
   habits (washing before handling food, after using the bathroom, etc).
I got no information as to the frequency of occurrance in the
population as a whole.  This is the most interesting data I feel is

transmission is unkoDnown, although the similarity to transmission of
hepatitis has caused an *assumption* that it is infectious.  Hospital
personell are urged to take the same precautions as with Hepatitis.
This will be confused with the infectious characteristics of AIDS itself.
These characteristics are unknown (except for the above similarity to
hepatitis).  Anything else is conjecture at this point.
I have seen figures on the prevalence of AIDS and will try to find them.
It is much, much lseeDDDess thatDn 0.1&%DD% D.  What makes it of concern to the CDC
and others is that the prevalence is increasing.  (It was unknown not
long ago).  Another point is the tDwe only have incidence and prevalance
of recognized cases.  OfterDn diseases have been around along time but
just haven't been recognized.  DDD, or have been assumed to have the wrong
characteristics.  Legionaires disease is an example of the first.D(the
causative agent was found in frozen fluids from patients from earlier
unexplained outbreaks of pneumonia).  An example of the second is
histoplasmosis, a fungal disease found in the Ohio valley.  For many
years it was thought to be a deadly disease as all patients recognized
to have it were critically ill and ususDally died.  It was later found that
almost everyone in the Ohio valley had antibodies to the fungus and the
fatal cDDDDal cases were the exception.  The others had had sublDclinical cases
and tDnow the disease is considered pretty dDbenign.  The point is that
little is know Dn bD*by anyone* about AITDDS.  What is known can be summarized
1.  The cases that have been recognized have resulted in very serious
    complications (cancer, overwhelming infection, etc)
2.  Most D, but not all, cases have been in homosecDxual males.
3.  It has (IthiDDD think) been transmitted by blood transfulDsion. (I am not
    as sure on this point).
4.  Its mode of transmission (using detective work and following patients
    to contacts, etc) seems similar to hepatitis and therefore the working
    hypothesis is that a transmissible agent (probably virus) is involved.
    This is not proven.
5.  It is at this point very reDare.
6.  I doubt (but cannot prove it D) that you can get it from toilet seats.

patients.  They summarize the current level of knowledge in the first paragraph.
     ""the etiology of the underlying immune deficiencies seen in AIDS cases is
unknown.  One hypothesis consistent with current observations is that a trans-
missible agent may be involved.  If so, transiDmission of the agent would appear
most commonly to require intimate direct contact involving mucosal surfaces, such
as sexual contact among homosexual males, or through parenteral spread, such as
occurs among intravenous drug abusers and possible hemophilia patients using
Factor VIII products.  Airborne spread and interpersonal spread through casual
contact do not seem likely.  These patterns resemble the distribution of disease
and modes of spread of hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis B virus infectons
occur very frequently among aidDDDAIDS cases.
     ""There is presently no evidence of AIDS transmission to hospital personnel
from contact with affected patients or clinical specimens.  Because of concern
about a possible transmissible agent, however, interim suggestions are
appropriate to guide patient-care and laboratory personnel, including those
whose work invloves experimental animals..... ""
Essentially the suggestions are those which are followed when caring for
patients ore boDDDDDr body fludDids with haDepatitis. (Handwashing, gloves, gowne,DDs D, masks,
etc.)
Quote from ""Morbidity and Mortality WeelDkly Report, 31:43, Nov 5, 1982.""
This is a respected newsletter type of thing sent by the Center for Disease
Control to physicians and other healteDh personnel.  The CDC, incidently, is
a government agency probably most noted currently for tracking down Legionaires
Disease.

Syndrome, AIDS for short. It is transmitted by any excrement or secretion,
including saliva, blood, urine, feces, and sperm. It is apparently fatal
about 40% of the time. It has a estimated latency time of about a year,
during which the victim is contagious but shows no symptoms.
	The relevance of this to net.singles is that it reminds me of a
recent article in Time about sexually transmitted diseases. This article
said there was a period when casual sex was possible. VD was easily cured.
Then along came herpes. Now, for better or for worse, the choice of a
partner could not be so care-free. This article even alluded to a wrathful
God inflicting herpes as a punishment.
	Well, herpes may be painful and uncurable, but it is not fatal.
Now here is a disease which is. I wonder if AIDS will encourage monogamy
in cases where herpes hasn't. Apparently male homosexuals, who as a group
tend to change partners frequently, are often victims of AIDS.  I wonder
what Time thinks of this. And, I wonder what you think of this.
	Oh, and don't get any blood transfusions either.
