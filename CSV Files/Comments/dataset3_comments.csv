Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I read in a recent article on ""Orgasm"" in Discover magazine (or one of
the clones) that the vaginal lubricant produced during arousal in women
is simply 'filtered blood serum' ie, blood cells are removed. This would
probably not remove the virus. How this enters the mans body in

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate
into a discussion on AIDS transmission in Africa is just one of those
phenomenons of the USENET ...

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------
	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

My personal feeling is that Burton's recomendation for
study is more viable. Linke's hypothesis is too tenuous
for my way of thinking.

	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was

announced at a conference of 3000 physicians (but apparently not to the

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around
the middle of Jan. '86.

	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why

	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

things, peroxide, is simply illadvised, bad folk-medicine, something we
certainly don't need right now when it comes to AIDS.  There are lots of
agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not
having sex with them.
Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most
likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS.  That simply isn't true.
It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.

for ***everyone***, male or female, gay or straight:

Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted
out of the New York Post or some similarly inane publication?  I mean,
you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the 
posting were about something which affected only women, then it would
make some sense.  How about a posting on how *pregnancy* is incurred,
with detailed descriptions of sex acts.  Go on.  I DARE you. Nyaa-Nyaa-Nyaa.

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed
Matt Crawford!  HA!  Now I can leave you wondering whether I've 
actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never
lepton his hadron, excited his fundamental modes, accepted an
injection of hot magma into my steaming caldera, intersected his
orbital, or even licked his throbbing popsicle.  
I will still maintain that a discussion of AIDS is inappropriate
for this newsgroup, not because it affects more men than women,
but because it is fundamentally absurd to assume that a classification
of people based on sex makes sex a primary concern.

Sure, and it also affects birdwatchers, and unix-wizards, and people
who watch tv, and pretty much everyone who reads any group on the
net.  That doesn't mean it should be posted to every group there is!
AIDS is a medical problem and belongs in net.med.  Period.
Those interested in reading information about AIDS may subscribe
to net.med.  Those interested in whatever net.women is doing these days
(I gave up on net.women a while back due to a poor S/N ratio) but
not interested in AIDS shouldn't have to wade through a bunch of
AIDS articles.
Taking your thinking to it's logical conclusion, there would be
one newsgroup.  What a mess.  Usenet is collapsing under it's own
weight, and posting articles to umpty-zillion newsgroups isn't
helping.

If they are shared by both sexes then definitely.  There is a newsgroup called

These kind of remarks are uncalled for.  This guy was making a genuine point
that these issues are NOT to do with women alone so keep your accusations to

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

-------
I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

available is vaccination; once the damned thing gets hold of you, you
better hope your immune system can handle it, 'cause if not...  And
the inventory of pathogenic viruses is becoming MORE and more interesting.

without also attacking the host.  But it is just appalling to me that
so much noise is made about similarly difficult problems; cancer,

chickenpox may give you shingles in your old age.
One has to wonder how long we have before the inevitable, particularly with
some of the rumors I hear about research in biogenetic warfare.  I believe the
Wall Street Journal published some articles a while back claiming that that
Russians were attempting to engineer a flu virus which would produce cobra
venom.  That may be a little far-fetched in reality, but it's certainly
not beyond the nonexistent morality of some of the nerds in the scientific
community to attempt it, if they could get the funding (no need to debate
whether there's anyone amoral enough to fund it, I hope).  Something like
that gets loose, you think the vaccine peddlers are going to be able to get

I've exerpted the parts of this guy's posting which make the most sense
responding to, inasmuchas most of it reads like an acute panic reaction to
a diagnosis of genital herpes.  A couple of points of clarification:
chickenpox and shingles are both caused by herpes zoster, and not by the
herpes simplex viruses.  Also, there are no human cancers which are yet
proven to be caused by a virus, with the possible exception of AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma, but the mechanism of the development of KS in people with
AIDS is still unelucidated.  The ""noises"" about viral contributions to
other diseases such as MS and juvenile diabetes are actually early leaks of
scientific investigation in progress, so it is simply silly to claim that
the ""medical profession doesn't care.""
He also betrays a rather peculiar attitude towards those who practice
medicine, as if they were selling something ""guaranteed"", rather than the
unfortunate truth even in this day and age, namely, that they are people
who try to use their limited knowledge to help people get well, or barring
that, remain as comfortable as possible.  Research is always trying to
expand the horizon of what is known so that it can be safely and
effectively applied in medical care, but there will always be gaps in our
knowledge.  ""Acute embarassment?"" Hardly--there is no reason whatsoever to
be embarassed.  Frustrated and challenged, maybe.
As he says, viruses are a particularly difficult nut to crack, because
their actions are intimately tied up with the ordinary expression of
genetic information in the cell; they don't really ""live"" on their own, so
it is much harder to discover and produce the kinds of ""magic bullets""
which have been the hallmark of modern therapy for other infectious
diseases.  Also, the herpes viruses seem to hide very well from the body's
immune system by residing in the spinal ganglia inbetween flareups.  But
there have been a number of effective drugs introduced in the last 15 years
which have anti-viral activity in very specific situations: idoxuridine in
corneal herpes simplex, vidarabine in corneal herpes and herpes simplex
encephalitis, and most recently, acyclovir for these indications and the
symptomatic treatment of genital herpes as well.  Amantadine is effective
in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A infection, and we can expect
more progress on these fronts as research continues.  No one promised it
would be easy.

	That's right; *all* we can do is vaccinate children so they no
longer contract polio, smallpox, mumps, measles, german measles (all viral
infections) not to mention diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough.  Since
nobody gets these diseases any more, finding chemotherapy for them is not a

research.

	You miss the point.  Almost nobody bitten by a rabid animal
contracts rabies anymore, thanks to the administration of the vaccine.
Pre-Pasteur, 100% of these people contracted the disease and died.

	A surprisingly lucid observation.  This is indeed the major problem
with fighting viral infections.  Antibiotics work *because* bacteria have a
sufficiently complicated metabolism.  You can feed a person erythromycin
(which screws up bacterial protein synthesis) without killing the patient
because a person's protein making machinery is sufficiently different from
the bacteria's that it is not affected by the drug.
	Viruses don't have any metabolism of their own; they are parasites
which rely on the host's metabolic machinery to grow.  Since they share our
metabolism, it is difficult to find a way to interfere with their growth
without also killing the patient.  The most success in viral chemotherapy
has come with viruses that are sufficiently complex that they supply some
of their own enzymes, which are different enough from the host's to be a
possible target for chemical attack.

	This is such a patently untrue statment, I don't know where to

to the effort.  Herpes and AIDS are two of the hottest fields in medical
research.

existing biotechnology.  BTW, I wonder why you consider the WSJ to be a
good source of scientific information.  They certainly are a respectable
publication, but to keep up with scientific progress, I would suggest the

	It's the United States government that funds such projects, and it
was the academic community that took the government to court recently and
won an injunction against the construction of a P4 (highest level of
biological containment) laboratory at Fort Dugway, Utah, that the Army
wanted to use for ""testing"" toxic biological aerosols.

Rabies is, for all intents and purposes, fatal once the virus has invaded
the nervous system.  Your friend was probably treated immediately after
the bite with rabies antiserum followed by a three weeks of daily vaccine
injections.  The whole point of this aggressive treatment is to neutralize
any rabies virus through the use of antiserum (made from horses, I think)
and to then cause the production of one's own antibodies through vaccination.
Your friend (luckily) never had rabies, and was never ""cured"" of it.

Rabies, per se, is nearly incurable.  However, the virus is quite a slow
starter, so that if you are bitten by a rabid animal and start the shots
immediately, you will be immune by the time the rabies virus really gets
going.
Once the virus gets going, however, it is very dangerous.  I believe that
the total of survived cases is up to about 4, worldwide.

	The two examples you give are genetic disorders, not infectious

this type of research.  We occasionally joke about submitting just such a

like vaccines that prevent polio or other virus infections.  I'm willing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

I know of two theories on this  point.  One  seems  reasonable,  the  other
frighteningly paranoid.
Reasonable:
One of the primary vectors of AIDS is anal  intercourse.  This  is  because
the  lining  of  the  rectum isn't built for such treatment and can develop
tears which provide a  direct  path  to  the  bloodstream.  The  virus  (or
whatever) is carried and passed on in semen.
Paranoid:
It is rumored that AIDS may be  part  of  a  biological-warfare  experiment
being performed by our own military.  The rumor contends they are testing a
virus that attacks  only  people  with  certain  specific  body  chemistry.
Ultimate  goal: a bug that kills only Russians (for example).  Legionaire's
Disease is said to have been a prototype.
I would discount these as paranoid  ravings  but  for  the  fact  that  our
military  was actually caught doing something almost as cold-blooded in the
San Francisco Bay area not  so  long  ago.  They  deliberately  released  a
tailored mild flu virus in the Bay area to see how the winds would disperse
it, based on patterns of who  caught  the  flu.  Five  innocent,  unknowing
citizens DIED because of that experiment.  Since then, I don't put ANYTHING
past them.
(If any of this is true, I suppose I'll be quietly abducted,  interrogated,
and disposed of in the next week or so -- all for passing on cocktail party
conversation.  Who says it's 1985?)

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained
by the characteristics of the populations in which it occurs.

	Well, it was actually more than a single article, and there were 
similar articles in Science and Nature.  
The facts are:
	1. HTLV-3 (the Aids-Related Virus) is found primarily in blood, but
also in saliva and semen, and maybe other places that haven't been explored
yet.
	2. The rectum is a) bacteriologically speaking, an exceptionally dirty
place, and b) not designed for intercourse (wrong epithelium).
 
	However, Steve does have his point. Just because something makes sense
logically, doesn't mean it is correct. Also, just as a grammatical point, the
use of the word ""vector"" was wrong. The correct phrase should have been
""means of transmission.""

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

Two points:

to a potential/current sex partner is unnecessary.
I don't know what my answer is to any of the questions so far.  I do know

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual
partner if you had a positive HTLV-III test. A positive antibody test does
*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.","FhgStjPmxOgJ",19,1986-03-21,-10,2

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,
there is no way currently to get rid of the damn thing.","H75UzjNUdRYJ",19,1986-03-21,-9,4

epidemic but believes, on the basis of the evidence so far in 
hand, that the primary vector for African AIDS has been vaginal
intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients.  Anal intercourse is apparently fairly rare in such
encounters (they've interviewed prostitutes and clients).
Recently, some US doctors announced the first corroborated
case of vaginal transmission of AIDS in this country.

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

I have some Gay friends who have been arrested in Toronto Ontario.  When word
got around that they were Gay, they were subject to a lot of violence in
prison -- something to the order of -- ``he's gay, so it is fine to gang rape
him -- after all, he loves this stuff.''  Solitary confinement sucks, but I
don't think that this is a lame excuse.

Why is quarantining someone with the ability to transmit a fatal disease
the ability of someone being able to transmit a fatal disease a lame
excuse?  I keep reading things that say, in effect ""why do anything about
people infected with the virus since the they may not develop aids?""  The
point that is missed with this idiocy is that most people are not opposed to
individuals walking around with fatal conditions, but rather to individuals
walking around who can give them a fatal condition.  I know of no one who
thinks heart patients, emphysema patients, etc. should be quarantined, even
though the may drop dead at any moment, because their afflictions cannot harm
others.  Nevertheless, many states restrict people with active tuberculosis
from holding certain jobs, and restrict people with untreated epilepsy from
perfroming certain task, because their afflictions can harm other people.
If AIDS was not contagious, or if people with full blown AIDS were not
contagious, society would probably be a lot less concerned about people
with AIDS walking about.  But the odds are that anyone who tests positive
to HTLVIII is infectious, and possibly more infectious than individuals
who are symptomatic.  Therefore whether an infected individual ever actually
comes down with AIDS or ARC is beside the point to society at large. 
Studies in some prisons have shown that much less than half of the inmates
have been exposed to the virus.  Although it may be unfair to make someone
who sells heroin spend a few years (or maybe months, giving sentencing in this
country) alone because he has been infected, it doesn't seem as unfair as
sentencing another inmate to death when he is gang raped by one or more
infected individuals.  When you commit crimes one of the chances you take is
that you will be deprived of some basic freedoms - one of those freedoms being
the ability to murder by infecting other people with your fatal diseases.

Although some people might claim that all homosexuals, whether criminal or
not, are equal, I am astonished to see someone purporting to be pro-homosexual
make this claim.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to sort out
people for death and slave labor.  Admittedly the ACLU and their ilk would
like the rest of us to believe that we are either on the verge of, or
have slipped into, the horrors of fascism in this country, but we are 
thankfully a long way from it.   It is an insult to those who died under
the Nazis to equate their ordeals with the inability of convicted criminals
to dress as they want.

It's an extremely lame excuse.  It is a breach of someone's fundamental civil

Garbage.  There is *no* proof or evidence to show that anyone who tests HTLV3
positive is infectious.  There is evidence to suggest that those who test HTLV3
postive have between a 10 and 15% chance of being diagnosed with one or more
of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS within 5 years after
testing HTLV3 positive.  Pretty low odds!  This *fact* is not beside the
point.  It has further been shown that HTLV3 is *very* difficult to transmit,
and that it probably requires multiple exposure to get the retrovirus.

What crime has someone who is infected with HTLV3 committed?  If you mean to 
imply that all HTLV3 exposed people are homosexual, and that homosexuality
is a crime, you are wrong.  Not all HTLV3-positive people are homosexual
men.  Fact.  And consensual acts between adults are not illegal in many states,
and for that matter, a lot of what goes on between heteros is statute illegal.
That you think that anyone who has committed a crime is to be deprived of the
basic right to life, you are one sick puppy.

Wrong.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to single out homosexuals
in concentration camps, just as they used stars of david to identify Jews and
cirles to identify ""intellectuals.""  Everyone was at risk for death in the
concentration camps.

We're not talking about the right of people to dress in their Calvin's in
prison.  We're talking about the singling out people for the soul reason
that they may be infectious, they may be homosexual, they may be diagnosed
with AIDS/ARC.  There is nothing to support any of those contentions in
being diagnosed HTLV3 positive.  There is no relationship between HTLV3
and one's sexuality, gender, race, color, creed, religion, eye color,
national origin, IQ, or food preferences.  NONE.  Viruses don't discriminate,
people do.","uaAqzE5LvNMJ",11,1986-02-13,-41,4

Book Club, Samuel R. Delany's ""Stars in My Pocket Like Grains
of Sand.""  The book club's blurb had read something like:
""drama of life, death and sexuality in the distant future.""
The problem I have with this is that the ad didn't disclose
that the ""sexuality"" was predominantly gay sexuality.
Despite some features of interest, I stopped reading the 
book about half way through, when it became evident that just
about all the romance and sex was to be gay.
Upon opening the cover, I had noted that Delany had also written
""Dhalgren"", which I HAD enjoyed (because of its unusual dreamscape
development), even though much or most of the sex in that was
also gay. (My only real annoyance was when the hero said something
like, straights who won't engage in bisexual affairs must have
a mean-spirited streak.)
Now, I'm not saying that I couldn't enjoy ANY novel with a gay
theme, any more than I'm saying that gays wouldn't enjoy any
straight novel.  But, if the novel isn't ""great literature,"" 
an important component of one's enjoyment is usually the ability
to identify with the major characters.  This leads to my questions
(at the risk of getting flamed as homophobic, etc.):
1) Should ads for novels at least suggest whether the sex/romance
   is predominantly straight or gay?  (I don't think this would be
   necessary if the main themes are not romantic, such as novels
   about social/political oppression.)
2) Should it make any difference? In other words, should it have
   mattered to me?
3) Was it my fault for not remembering or knowing that Delany's
   sf writing has a gay slant?
4) Do I have a point in objecting to the way the book club advertised
   the book?
5) Was the book such a work of creative genious that it transcended

Why don't you just return the book to the book club with a letter stating you
felt they should have included the word ""gay"" before ""sex"" in the blurb,
and that you feel they misrepresented it?  Argue with the *book club*, not
net.motss, for heaven's sake!  Writing an article to this newsgroup 
panning a book because it has gay sex is not likely to gain you much

   1) Should ads for novels at least suggest whether the sex/romance
      is predominantly straight or gay?  
Why? The book already said it had sexual content. Just how much more 
descriptive does that have to be? Down to the last kiss? Since it seemed
that you did not so much object to the gay content as much as the quantity,
why not just put the book down? 
 
   2) Should it make any difference? In other words, should it have

Did it? Whether it mattered to you or not does not seem to me to be the 
point here. You are suggesting that better warnings or at least more accurate 
descriptions of what is in a book be printed on the cover. Remember that 
what is printed on the cover of a book is intended to entice(sp) the reader into
buying the book. Not to warn them off from a purchase.

If I do not like the style of a particular author, I do not buy more of 
their books.
   4) Do I have a point in objecting to the way the book club advertised
      the book?
The book club probably just printed what the publisher put out on the book,
so I would not suggest getting mad at the book club. They are trying to 
peddle books, not censor then for their readers. Look to the 700 Club
for services like these. If you thought you ordered a cookbook and got the
joy of gay sex instead, then you problably ought to check to see what you
ordered, then complain like any other unsatisfied customer.
   5) Was the book such a work of creative genious that it transcended
      such considerations?
Do you mean that since this book is 'great' that it should not be censored?
Please define 'great' or 'work of creative genious'. 
All of your questions are issues in the shades of grey and trying to appease
everyone is going to be hard. Blatant misrepresentation of a product is
fraud; being uphappy with the limited description of the contents is not.
If they told you in the review who done it, why buy the book?

I haven't read the book, so take this with a grain of salt, if you like.
The book description is fine as it stands.  It could be more specific,
sure, but I don't think you should have trouble identifying with the
gay character(s) of the book.
Other than the differences in ""physical specifics"" between gay and
straight sex, I don't see how gay relations ALWAYS differ from straight
relations.  Unless you can come up with some specific characteristic
of gay relationships which a) are unique to gay relationships and
b) you can never relate to, I don't think you have any reason to
avoid books including gay relationships.  Gay relationships are
just relationships.
Of course, the ""physical specifics"" of gay sex may be what you want to
avoid thinking about or trying to relate to.  If that's the case,
I still don't think the description need be more specific.  Some people
are disgusted by the idea of gay sex; disgust is in the gut of the
beholder, I guess.  But if you don't like thinking about gay sex,
that's your problem; I might not want to read books about women that
cheat on men because I'm disgusted by such behavior, but it's not
reasonable for me to expect book summarizers to warn me of such books.
Another (unfortunate) unique characteristic of gay relationships is
that the gays involved have to (today, at least) deal with the social
stigmas attached to being gay.  No, straight people cannot truly
identify with this, but I don't think this is reason to stop reading.
I'm actually curious to hear of any aspects of gay relationships
which are unique TO gay relationships.  A friend of mine is gay
and I've never been able to see such differences in his relationship
with his male friends.
-- Rich Wagner
P.S.  Some people think that being able to talk about common
      problems/joys is an important characteristic of friends.
      If you think book descriptions should be more explicit
      about the type of sex they describe, then it seems like
      you could also conclude that people should wear ""Straight""

On the contrary.  It seems to me that there is an increasing tendency among
folk nowadays, in their attempts to appear or to be tolerant of 
the behavior of others, to express a uniformly ""nonjudgemental"" attitude by
exercising a lack of judgment altogether. Toleration need not imply approval;
I do many things that my friends strongly disapprove of.  They do not feel
the necessity of forcing me to adopt their attitudes, and I do not feel the
need to make them approve of my actions.  Approval and tolerance are quite
different, and as with all things in my opinion, should involve the use of
one's judgmemental faculties, not the abandonment of them.
As a case in point, all sex is not just sex. Whether it be heterosexual(1),
homosexual(2), or autoerotic(3), there are a wide class of sexual activities
which either represent profound emotional disease or are simply evil. To
fear to express disapproval of an act for fear of appearing intolerant is
a form of moral cowardice.
Similarly, one's tastes, like one's moral stance, should involve some 
descrimination.  To appreciate a fine wine it is necessary to recognise
that there will be vintages which compare unfavorably with it, to your 
palate at least. There is no requirement to enjoy pears as much as
apples; there is no requirement to care for pears at all - it certainly 
does not imply evil intentions towards pear orchards nor towards those
who care for pears.  To suggest that all wines or all fruit or all 
writing should appeal equally to ones taste is to argue for a dulled 
sensiblity and foggy thought.  Thus, it is not at all necessary, 
nor even desirable, that one enjoy a recounting of any random sexual 
act.  I suggest quite the opposite, that one has every right to object 
to buying a bag of apples and finding it full of pears.

It is not your responsibility to keep tabs on the sexual proclivities

That depends on how much of a review one can expect from the vendor.  I 
suppose that if you buy a bag simply labeled ""fruit"", you can't complain
too much if pears are what's inside.  You might write the company and
let them know that their labelling is inadequate. I personally think that
one should expect better of a book review. It is in the best interest of
a merchant to please his or her customers, especially in things that 
cost little money or effort to change.
To claim that an adequate book review is censorship is to argue that
we should buy and read books randomly - a waste of time, effort, and
money.

Love brought me to a silent Grove,

things might be different later on, but all of the sex so far in this
book, homosex or otherwise, has about as much to do with gay or straight
20th century Earth culture as moon rocks do.  Delaney uses sex just like
any other characteristic as a means to ""alienate"" the readers from the
characters and the worlds they inhabit.  Whether its the fact that all
the people wear little lozenges over their face or that all the straights
want to get flogged or the fact that our hero likes others of the same sex,
it's all just an example of his maddening arbitrariness.  But to call

Back to Delany:  Just about all of his early work has no sex in it at all.
This includes The Jewels of Aptor, the Towers Trilogy, the Einstein
Intersection, Babel-17, and Nova.  Read the last three if you don't
like some particular variety of sex in your books but want to see why
Delany is considered to be such a good writer.  Babel-17 has a strong
female protagonist, for those who are tired of Delany's Kidd character.
There are several short story collections, none with a bad story,
many of them Hugo or Nebula winners, all with practically no sex.
If you *want* weird sex, try Tides of Lust (if you can find it).
It's got a bit of everything.  It appears that he wanted to practice
writing about sex before he wrote Dhalgren.
Personally, I like his later stuff as well or better than his earlier.

	o for those who have read, or will take the trouble to
	  read SIMPLGOS, you will note that his treatment of

It is certainly anyone's prerogative to take offense at Delaney's book,
but that does not exempt the person who makes a public statement about
being offended by the supposed ""gay"" slant of the novel from equally
public criticism.  We'd take any similar statements about other groups
as simply vulgar and an indication that the poster had problems which
needed to be worked on, and it think it's to the credit of everyone who's
responded except Bill that this is the prevailing sentiment here.  It's
a little unclear to me why Bill cites three articles on evil/bad sexual
practice, because the offensive part of Friedman's article was PRECISELY
because he expressed a dislike for the book's um, orientation, and not
because he felt that specific acts were evil or immoral.  How SHOULD someone
respond, huh?  ""Thank you for sharing that with us""?

AHEM - gay people are socially oppressed all over the world, and politically
oppressed in most places. (I guess SF & LA may be exceptions to this).
Anyway, the main theme of ""Stars in my Pocket ..."" isn't romantic, at least I
didn't think so.  It's about the uncertainty surrounding language; the family 
vs. the SIGN, the linguistic WEB (an image he used in Babel 17).  The central 
character is called Marq Dyeth (MARK DIE-ETH, geddit?).
The ""romantic"" bits are more concerned with sexuality than romance - which
sexual practices are tolerated in different societies, how people react to this.

No.  Gayness is perfectly normal, and shouldn't require any warning notices,
bell-ringing, or crying of ""unclean, unclean"".

No.  I don't think a book ever transcends the considerations you apply when you
read.  If you mean ""was it so good in other ways that these considerations
are outweighed"", that's for you to decide.  Since you only read half of it, I
guess for you it wasn't ""great literature"".
I think it's Delany's worst book since babel-17.  It preaches too much (the
epilogue is particularly bad at this).  Parts of it are brilliant, but overall
I rate it lower than his other recent stuff (still worth reading though - I
rate Delany pretty highly!)
Try ""Neveryona"" for similar ideas done better, and with less gay content.
You probably want to miss ""Flight from Neveryon"" though - it's much more
explicit than ""Stars in my Pocket ..."".

I apologise if my comments regarding the questions about objecting to
homosexual content in a book seemed a bit bizarre.  In part, this was 
because my first reply was in fact a comment on Mr. Kiselev's statement 
that one should not have a preference in the way sex is depicted in
literature, since ""sex is sex."" 
I suppose I am simply rather sensitized to the subject due to my 
line of work (for those of you who do not read net.med, I am a 
forensic pathologist.  Forensic Pathology is that medical specialty 
which deals primarily in the evaluation of unnatural death, though we are 
also usually heavily involved in evaluating any process, natural or 
unnatural, which has a general public health impact.), but I was trying 
to make the point that sex is not just sex, and that one should not 
mildly accept nor feel obligated to appreciate a literary description 
of sexual activity on the ground that a nonjudgemental approach to 
the subject is necessarily the best approach. 
In the case of the paraphilias, it is a repeated pattern that  
practitioners mature within a given practice,
beginning with the aquisition and appreciation of allusionary or allegoric
material, move to more explicit accounts, and eventually to frankly
pornographic material which is then used both for gratification alone and
as templates for acting out.  Maturation of paraphilic experience is thus
a learning experience which may occur over a period of years, ending in
fatality and/or exploitation.
As to Mr. Dyer's criticism that what I had to say had little to do with
homosexuality, I must admit culpability and repeat that I reacted more to
Mr. Kiselev's reply than to the original question.  I certainly do not wish
to imply that homosexuality, per se, is a paraphilia. Quite the opposite;
I have dealt with more than a few people who suffered considerable ill
effects because of such a misapprehension.  One  young man, for instance, 
tried so hard to deny his homosexuality that he became engaged to be 
married.  He suffered numerous psychosomatic diseases, including peptic 
ulcer disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which can be extrememly 
serious and rarely frankly life threatening, primarily because of his 
profound constant anxiety.  Once he accepted his orientation, his health 
improved immeasurably.  Still, I feel strongly that Mr. Friedman 
(the original poster) need not feel guilty in any way because he lacks 
an appreciation for homosexual literature. 
My second point was that if one has a pronounced preference for a given
sexual orientation in literature, it is not ""wrong"" to express that preference 
in one's buying habits, nor is it ""wrong"" to be disappointed when those
preferences are not met in a book that one expected to gratify that 
preference.  The original poster had specifically asked if it was somehow
wrong for him to be disappointed in finding a homosexual slant in a book
he had bought with the expectation of finding descriptions of heterosexual
sensuality.
My ignorance that the reviews by the Quality Paperback Book Club are 
meant to be very brief was a misapprehension based on my 
experience with the only book club I belong to, the History Book Club.  
In it, most new additions to the lists are accompanied by a review of a 
few pages in length.  While older books are described in just a short 
sentence, almost all books listed have been reviewed at length at some time.
I still feel that a book club has a certain responsibilty to 
its members -  I have seen volumes of Norman's Gor series described
in the same uninformative terms of ""sensuality"" and would be distressed
to find that I had spent money to obtain such a volume.  As an aside 
for those of you interested in history, I have been extremely
happy with the service and selection of the History Book Club.
I suppose that since I am strongly opposed to literary censorship (Indeed,
there is often no better way to attempt to understand the psychodynamics of,
or subjective responses to the paraphilias than through literary description.  
Observe the description of erotic asphyxiation in William S. Burroughs' 
""Naked Lunch"", or the hanging of Roland in ""Justine"" by de Sade.), I feel 
that the most appropriate way for society to deal with paraphilic 
literature is through diffuse societal disapproval rather than legislation.  
In another area of public health, such a society wide approbation 
is developing, for instance, against 
cigarette smoking, and I feel that such an attitude will work effectively to
decrease fatality as today's young mature.  Similar attitudes are developing
regarding drinking and driving. Unfortunately, I see the opposite 
occuring in the area of sexuality, with greater societal acceptance of
a number of sexual activities which may lead to greater exploitation of
the young and an increase in sexually related fatalities.  Of the 
lust murders I have seen in the past few months, the great majority
have been perpetrated by people under the age of 18.
I have great respect for Mr. Delaney, both for his writing and for
his success as a homosexual parent, though I
prefer his earlier work (Triton, Driftglass, Dhalgren, The Ballad of
Beta Two) to his later efforts. While I have never had the pleasure
of meeting him, my cousin, a poet in New York and student of Allen
Ginsburg (her name is Alice Notley - BUY HER BOOKS!!!) has had such
an opportunity and describes him in glowing terms. 
 
Upon reflection, I am sure that Mr. Kiselev, when he made such global
statments that ""sex is sex"" and ""romance is romance"", had the vision of
any number of loving couples in mind.  When I read such a statement,
however, I instead thought of fugue states and edged weapons.  I apologise
for projecting my concerns on the net.

Let's see, we could have all of the Jews wear yellow stars of David,
the homosexuals could wear lavender triangles, etc.  For those of you
youngsters (i.e. born after 1945) this was tried in the 1930's in
Germany by the Nazi's.  The final end result was over 6 million Jews
killed, x million Gypsies, slavs, homosexuals, etc. and the biggest
war to date, along with the development of the atomic bomb to stop the
war.  (:.|) (sour smiley face)
Seriously, it is things like this that lead to what happened during
WWII.  It starts with censorship, bookburning, etc.  Each group is
lead to hate and distrust the next.  Jews, Catholics, Masons, Gypsies,
Homosexuals, etc. were all made to wear identifying tags.  All were
lead to believe that one group by one group ""they"" were the ones
causing all of the problems.  What really bothers me is that some of
the same things are now happening in America.  We are having
censorship of magazines now.  What next?  I used to be able to see
magazines such as High Society, Stag, etc. on the newstands, they have
disappeared.  The magazines that do appear for sale are totally
censored now by the publishers for fear of persecution by the law/or
various hate groups.  I see that schools are removing books as being
offensive (i.e. Tom Sawyer, various classics, etc.) due to language or
what is even worse unpopular views expressed in the books.  I thought
that this type of thing only happened in the deep South U.S. but it is
happening in Washington state and in other areas in the Pacific NW.
Personally I find homosexuality to be offensive, but I think that
everyone has the right to their own lifestyle, no matter how I feel
about it.
Sorry about the soapbox, but the continuing series of articles about
truth in book selling (a la gay sex in books) has gotten to me.

We are talking of fairly staright forward gay sex here - NOT anything ""EVIL"" or
emotionally sick ( unles you call homosexuality and autoeriticism  ""SICK"" and/or
""EVIL""). If the characters in the book are gay - I'd expect them to practice
gay sex. If the characters in the book are slimy slugs - I expect THEIR sexual
practices to be slimy slug ones. If the book unnecessarily overemphasizes the
erotic and sexual aspects and becomes pornographic - that's one thing. If the
author has included an erotic scene as a means to better define the
characters and their relationships - that's a totally different situation.

It's NOT book review we are talking about - it's the blurbs on the cover and
the back of the book.( OR *WAS* it a review ? If it was - ignore this paragraph)
The cover blurbs usually give you a GENERAL idea about the GENERAL direction
of the book. Since I have learned to read English (I still have not learned to
wright ;-) I have bought close to a dosen books based on their cover blurbs and
a quick scan of the wrighting stile - and found them very dissatisfying and
boring to the point where I could not bring myself to finish them. Out of
250-300 books - that's not a bad ratio! Those WERE paperbacks, tho'. If they
were hardcover editions that I have payed $14-$18 for - I'd be upset too....

I agree to some extend - but who's responcilbility is it to seek out the
reviews? The reader's or the book distributor's? Adequate book review is a
great thing. Expecting an in-depth review from a short blurb is absurd.
Most often the book and record clubs grace only the ""selectio of the month""
items with reviews. (I could be wrong - I have not joined ALL the clubs out

If you still doubt, there is an SF book that is designed to stress
your sensibilities which you might try reading: J G Ballard's CRASH.
The narrator of CRASH develops a sexual fixation for mutilations which
are suffered in automobile accidents; he becomes entangled in another
man's erotic fantasies about committing suicide in a violent car crash
with a famous actress.  Have you ever wondered about some of the people
who come to stand and stare at the gore and debris that result from a
deadly crash?  This novel confirms your worst fears about them...
CRASH is a pornographic horror novel -- it is 'eroticism' which is
guaranteed to shock you and revolt you.  Reading the book to the end is
a strong test of liberal attitudes, and if you're like me you'll come
away with a much less complacent view of sexual perversion.

I too was a little thrown by the sexual orientation.  Not the gender
orientation, but the fact that the protagonist was gay, but that
he was only interested in men with acne scars who bit their nails.
However, I don't think the publisher should have to warn readers
""This book is cheifly of interest to Ugly homosexual nailbiters.""
What I do object to is that the blurb on the back said the book
was about a love affair that would affect the galaxy.  This in fact 
never happened.  In fact, nothing ever happened.  The whole book
sets the scene for the sequel (which may or may not be out now).
I guess the publishers decided (possibly correctly) that the SF
reading public would not but a novel advertised as a character study.
That's too bad, because as a character study it is interesting.
The writing is pretty good, too.  I especially liked the way Delany
turns sexual imagery on it's head by calling everyone 'she' unless
she/he/it is being thought of sexually, in which case Delaney uses
'he'. 
The sexuality of the book was unusual, but in no way disturbing.
It also was not at all erotic, which is unusual in a modern book
about love.","fusxdkVmM0AJ",0,1986-02-01,3,1

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

digest it came from, so I'm posting to all original recipients for
this important clarification):
	From: Jamie Andrews <ihnp4!alberta!ubc-vision!ubc-cs!andrews>
	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

things, peroxide, is simply illadvised, bad folk-medicine, something we
certainly don't need right now when it comes to AIDS.  There are lots of
agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Possibly, but nearly every pleasure involves some sort of risk.
Everyone who eats raw oysters runs some risk of being poisoned, and
everyone who likes driving at 100 on the Mass Pike runs some risk of
crashing.  Lest I be criticized for ignoring the social implications
of disease, societies make these decisions as well, and people die as a
result.
I don't think it's irresponsible, either from a personal or a societal
point of view, to review the risks involved---with the help of lists
such as the one recently posted to this newsgroup, the one that caused
all of the fuss---and decide that certain acts which could conceivably
lead to disease and death are worth some risk.  A rich, sweet, wet kiss
is the primary symbol of human romance, and I'll be damned if I give it
up.  Who cares about sex, even plants do that (:-)).

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not

Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most

It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.

Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted
out of the New York Post or some similarly inane publication?  I mean,
you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the 
posting were about something which affected only women, then it would
make some sense.  How about a posting on how *pregnancy* is incurred,
with detailed descriptions of sex acts.  Go on.  I DARE you. Nyaa-Nyaa-Nyaa.

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed
Matt Crawford!  HA!  Now I can leave you wondering whether I've 
actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never
lepton his hadron, excited his fundamental modes, accepted an
injection of hot magma into my steaming caldera, intersected his
orbital, or even licked his throbbing popsicle.  
I will still maintain that a discussion of AIDS is inappropriate
for this newsgroup, not because it affects more men than women,
but because it is fundamentally absurd to assume that a classification
of people based on sex makes sex a primary concern.

Cheryl, get over it.  Whether you like it or not, AIDS is a disease
that affects everyone, even you.  Will, and I, and Jeff, and anyone
else who post information about AIDS, are simply trying to provide the
latest information so that we can all be around in a couple of years
to keep on trading insults.  Will's information is not from the
*Post*, rather from the latest medical information currently
available.  As for sending this posting to net.women, you may be
right--Will should have posted it to net.announce and net.general.
And stop posting to net.nlang.africe. The topic is inappropriate for
that group. take it out of your newsgroups list if you want to
continue flaming.  Or better yet, let's take this off-line and into
the mail.

If they are shared by both sexes then definitely.  There is a newsgroup called
'net.med' specifically for medical issues.  You should use that.

These kind of remarks are uncalled for.  This guy was making a genuine point
that these issues are NOT to do with women alone so keep your accusations to
yourself.

This brings up some questions which, as a regular blood donor, not in a
high risk group, have occurred to me.  I know that the blood banks are now 
testing donor blood.  I can see the reason for that.  However, the test is 
often wrong.
If my blood tests positive, will they inform me about it?  If so, how?
Who else will be informed?  (An especially interesting question--since
I give through a program at work.) Must I pay for the extra tests to confirm 
or invalidate their positive test?  It seems to me that if their test was 
mistaken, I shouldn't be made to pay. (Beyond being scared shitless, of 
course!  I have visions of thousands of people sueing them for pain and 
suffering.)  Suppose I test false positive--can I be reinstated as a blood 
donor when the incorrectness of their test is confirmed?  I would like to 
give blood if possible--but if they don't want my blood, even for an invalid 
reason, do I have any recourse?  Or, if they act badly, should I even care?
As an aside, it seems to me that there are some issues connected with these
tests on which straights, (or bi's like me) should really be siding with
the gay community--like who gets told about your positive test, and how
society treats you (i.e. keeping you out of school or work).  Obviously,
given the information quoted, this could happen to anyone.  And it is most
likely, with a false positive, to happen to those people who care about
others enough to give blood since they will be tested often.  Given the 
irrational, lynching attitude I've seen, this could really mess up a person's 
life.  And of course, it's even worse with a true positive, because you need 
support even more in that situation.  But I don't see people caring.  I 
wonder how many people will have to be hurt before people do care.  Sigh.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the

society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

CDC after needle sticks in the US. Not one has yet developed AIDS, or AIDS-
related complex (ARC). Of those tested, none has tested Antibody Positive
for HTLV-3.
	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use

FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

-------
I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is
compulsory.

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

like to submit a topic for discussion...bisexuality.
I think  this is an interesting topic for several reasons. 
Homosexuality has, over the past few years, gained a recognized
place in todays society. Homosexuals now have respected and well
formed communities, they have faught for their civil rights and
all this had led to partial social acceptance. This acceptance by the
outside and the supportiveness generated on the inside of the gay
world has done much to create the opportunity for gays and lesbians
to live happy and loving lives. However; it is difficult to say that the
same opportunity exists for bisexual people.
As one author has written, the bisexual is at the disadvantage of both
homosexuals and heterosexuals, in terms of acceptance, because
bisexuals are ""enemies in both camps"".
It used to be the case that psychology only considered bisexuality
as a transitory state between hetero- and homosexuality. Now, many
psychologists don't believe that crap. And now with the Kinsey Report
(I believe) it is thought that there may be many more bisexuals than
homosexuals [I don't think one is required to be active with both
sexes in order to fall into the range of 'bisexual', the determinant
is one's preferences]
So, where are they all? Bisexuality is interesting because there are
now two closets to hide in i.e. one can be openly gay or straight and
yet sneak on over to  the other side. There is good reason for one
to do this. We now have admittedly gay politicians and public servants
but could you imagine an admittedly bisexual one? 
Clearly a  major difficulty is facing the desire for marriage and children...
I mean if one is bisexual, one could choose to live a straight life
and not act on same-sex desires and thus gain the fulfilment that
comes from family life. But, it is a trade off. Is being bisexual never
to be happy? To satisfy both sexual preferences nearly eliminates the
possibility of a monogamous relationship. And to have a monogamous
relationship implies a sort of celebacy. Or does it?
Let's hear from some representatives of the gay and straight community
on what they think today's sentiments towards bi's are. Also, it
would be interesting to hear from bisexuals about their personal
difficulties in starting and maintaining relationships.

wanted some kind of gay sexual experience. As we talked, I became quite
convinced of two things: 1) that he was indeed happily married,  wanted to
do nothing to jeopardise that marriage, and judged gay sex to be very
threatening to his marriage, and 2) that he considered his same-sex
inclinations to be less strong than his opposite-sex ones. Yet he still felt
that he was gay. After a lengthy discussion, I suggested the ''If it ain't
broke, don't fix it'' philosophy, and he very dubiously agreed. I suggested
that he contact me from time to time, but I've never seen him since.
I don't know what to make of bisexuality, myself. Apart from the normal
bisexuality that all of us experience, professed bisexuality seems to be
something very different. I have often heard bisexuality used as a
justification for a series of inconclusive relationships (yes, I know that's
a cliche, but...). It must, however, be fairly difficult for someone to make
a serious commitment to another person if s/he assumes that his/her sexual
makeup requires continuing experiences with other people. (Yes, that makes
me a closed relationship bigot, but these *are* the eighties, you know :-)
On the other hand, do we want to draw lines so finely? After a long period
of being on the outside looking in, the last thing I want to do to someone
else is to marginalise her/him.  I was recently reading (in The Body
Politic) of the political squabbles at the Greater London Gay Community
Centre. Apparently, there was a strong sentiment that S/M people and
bisexuals, among others, not be allowed the use of the Centre. It was with
some embarrassment that about 1/4 of the Centre's staff confessed to being
bisexual. 
At the risk of flogging a dead horse, let me suggest yet another reason why
we should prefer ''gay'' to ''homosexual''. I have known gay bisexuals,
non-gay bisexuals, and (strangest of the lot) non-gay homosexuals. It all
has to do with how you identify yourself, not whom you sleep with.","ESVyCif7eB8J",15,1985-08-16,2,1

This past year, my lover and I got to know a visiting scholar who was
bisexual--he was using his stay in the U.S. to explore his gay interests
for the first time.  He is married, and has children.  Apparently he was
aware of his feelings toward men for a long time, and finally decided that
he had a choice of going crazy or actually acting on his desires.  He was a
card-carrying bisexual, because he was still attracted to women and was
having great sex with his wife all this time.
At least in his situation, it seemed to me to be a terrible problem--his
wife knew absolutely nothing about this, and he had no intention of telling
her anything, as much from fear about her reaction as from obstinacy.  He
LOVED his kids and didn't want to do anything which might have any risk of
a separation.  Thus, he often resorted to ""affair"" behavior, lying to her
about where he'd be going or who he'd be seeing if it was at ALL
gay-related, not simply sexual.  We often felt like the ""other couple"", as
it were, since we were being lied about, if not actually lying ourselves.
It was the duplicity that bothered me so much--a relationship is built
on trust, and it hurt me to see his wife being deceived regularly.
Bisexuality is fine if the spouse knows about it, and they have dealt
with the issues of monogamy and jealousy, but that surely wasn't the
case here.  I cannot stand too harshly in judgement of him; here was a
person who had wrestled with a very painful personal issue, and was
attempting some kind of compromise which allowed him to continue to
keep the various parts of his life in a precarious balance.

It seems to me that there could logically be two sorts of bisexuals::
	1. A person who has separate sexual desires for males and females,
	which is what Hanson assumes above.
	2. A person with a single sexual desire that can be satisfied by
	both males and females.
[For the purposes of this discussion, by ""bisexual"" I mean a person who
has SIGNIFICANT sexual attraction to both females and males. To leave
out the ""significant"" would, if Kinsey is right, mean including nearly
everyone under the category ""bisexual"". And of course, there must be plenty
of bisexuals even under this narrower definition, but out of homophobia
or whatever, they chose to get married and not deal with their
homosexual desires.]
Any bisexual netters out there? Are you of type 1 or of type 2 above?

ancestry have in past places of racial hatred been termed ""black""
as they were perceived to be ""tainted"", so too have I been seen as a

legal point of view.  The associated philosophy is a different issue.)

myself a Jew because I identify with the culture in which I was raised
even though I do not share many of the beliefs which I consider

I percieve myself as gay.  By the way, I would be legitamately

between the gay or straight options due to pressure.  I have known a
few people who claimed to be bisexual and I felt after talking to

themselves (ie.  I'm bisexual and the inference is that I am only
half ""wrong""-- this of course assumes that they find difficulty in
recognizing their true feelings and they believe they are less
""wrong"" than being outright gay.)

high school sex/family life classes, describing a little of what it is like
to be gay in this society.  One of the guidelines they use is that no
bisexuals are allowed to be on the panels.
This reasoning reflects the attitude ""a bisexual is a gay person who hasn't

      It's a difficult question;  I watch attractive members of both sexes 
in much the same way, but when I daydream about going to _bed_ with someone,
rather than just admiring aesthetics, I have totally different feelings.
This might be because I have very limited gay experience, and might be
because I tend to think in terms of ""relationships"" and I would find it
difficult to form a long-term relationship with a woman (as I get older
and want children more and more immediately, I tend to concentrate on the
_men_ I am attracted to).  I think that speaking strictly sexually, I am a
type 2;  but since my sexuality is so bound up with concerns of attachments,
I consider my desires for men and for women in a totally different light.

I don't really understand point #1.  Unless one assumes that relationships
will be stereotypical, the pressure to choose between gay and straight is
simply pressure to choose (or not) between different individuals, i.e.
pressure to choose between monogamy or not.  I think that if one is not
satisfied with either the ""gay"" or ""straight"" life, then maybe this simply
means that one is not satisfied with the individuals that have come to
represent this life.
I don't think that my life would be THAT different if my partner was a
woman rather than a man.  I'd have new worries: being accepted by society,
how to have children.  I'd also be rid of certain other worries: birth
control, wondering whether inequalities in our relationship are sex-based.
I think that the main difference in the relationship would be because I'd
be with a different person rather than with a person of a different sex.
One would hope that most of the joys and struggles inherent in a relationship
have more to do with the personalities of the people involved than with
their sexes.
This discussion in net.motss puzzles me somewhat.  How easily factionalised
people can become!  one would think, that since homosexuals have had such
a hard time explaining to heterosexuals that *really* people are pretty
much the same, no matter what their sexual orientation is, that they would
apply this reasonning to another group of people with a different sexual
orientation.  Yet I hear some claims of not ""trusting"" bisexuals, of
bisexuals being in both ""camps"".  Not trusting what?  what camps are we
talking about?  is there a war going on here between homosexuals and
heterosexuals with bisexuals as double-spies?  is that what love is all
about for some of you?  give us a break!

(I wrote this article for the December 1984 issue of ""Sappho Speaks;
 The Lesbian and Gay Quarterly Journal at UCSD"")
		Bisexuality: Coming Out Twice
     If you met me at work, chances are you would think  I'm
straight. If you met me at a bar, you might think I'm a les-
bian.  In both cases, you would be mistaken.
     Yes, I am an often misunderstood person; I'm  bisexual.
False  assumptions  by friends, co-workers and acquaintances
are just some of my problems.  Another is that frequently  I
am rejected by gays and straights alike.  Also, there is the
problem of satisfying my needs while  still  being  fair  to
those close to me.
     I have an open but serious relationship with a man.   I
have  a  difficult  time letting people know I am polygamous
and it is REALLY okay with my boyfriend.  I find it next  to
impossible to explain to people that my boyfriend and I both
sleep with other women.
     People do understand my situation  eventually,  through
observation and stumbling conversations -- ""Oh, yeah, Larry,
he's my um, boyfriend,"" said at a meeting of  lesbians,  or,
to  one  of  our  straight  friends, ""What did I do Saturday
night? Well, I went dancing. Where? At a lesbian  bar.  Yes,
Larry knows...he was there...""
     Upon learning I am bisexual, some people assume I  must
be  promiscuous.   I  have  heard  bisexuals  referred to as
``people who will sleep with anyone they meet''.
     Being bisexual does not mean having sex with  everyone,
just  as  being  gay  or lesbian does not mean sleeping with
everyone of the same sex, and being straight does  not  mean
sleeping  with  everyone  of the opposite sex.  I am choosey
about my lovers.  I just have twice as many people to choose
among.
     I realize gays have a similar  problem  convincing  the
straight  world  they  are  not all promiscuous. I am disap-
pointed to find that some lesbians and  gay  men  generalize
about  bisexuals,  even  though they complain when straights
generalize about them.
     Rejection is another problem faced  by  most  lesbians,
gay  men  and bisexuals.  There is almost no workplace, com-
munity or school that does not  have  some  people  who  are
violently against homosexuality.  Gays and lesbians can find
acceptance within their own community, however.
     Bisexuals are not completely  welcomed  by  either  the
straight  or gay communities.  Straights see us as homosexu-
als; gays see us as indecisive, cowardly gays  or  straights
who are just experimenting.  Some straights think, ""Well, if
she can enjoy sex with men, why doesn't she  take  the  easy
route and give up women?""
     In      ``Lesbian      Nation''      Jill      Johnston
states,``Bisexuality  is  not so much a cop-out as a fearful
compromise.  Many women pride themselves on their  bisexual-
ity,  claiming  they happily have it both ways. But one half
of those both ways is a continued service to the  oppressor,
whose energies are thus reinforced to perpetuate the oppres-
sion of that part of  the  woman  who  would  make  it  with
another woman.'' Later she goes on, ``Bisexuality is staying
safe by claiming allegiance to heterosexuality.''
     Jill Johnston is an extreme example of a lesbian femin-
ist,  and  the  above  was written over a decade ago, in the
early 1970's.  Most of my friends are not this extreme.  But
I  have gotten the feeling from some of them that they think
I am copping out by continuing to  have  relationships  with
men.   Other friends think it's okay for people to be bisex-
ual or straight, but they don't want to include such  people
in their inner social circle.
     Rather than establishing separate societies  for  every
imaginable type of person, I would rather we learn to accept
differences in each other.  It hurts  me  to  feel  excluded
from  the  lives  of  lesbians  because  they feel I have it
easier than they do.  I disagree -- I still have to come out
to my friends.  I have the added tension of coming out to my
gay friends as bisexual.  I have to  deal  with  homophobes,
just  as they do.  I don't hide behind my bisexuality -- the
struggle for gay rights is important to me.  I find  it  sad
that  gays,  who  have  been discriminated against for their
sexuality, can do the same to bisexuals.
     There is a gray area between the subject of bisexuality
and  the  subject  of monogamy versus polygamy.  I have said
that I do not consider myself promiscuous, yet to satisfy my
desire  for men and my desire for women in the same universe
requires something beyond one steady relationship.   When  I
had  monogamous  relationships  with men, I still felt some-
thing missing from my life.
     This is where I  have  the  problem  of  satisfying  my
needs,  while being fair to my lovers.  I have to explain to
potential lovers that they can never be the ""one  and  only""
for me.  This does not mean that I don't care about them.
     Many potential lovers of both sexes are put off  by  my
refusal  to  tie  myself down to one person.  In order to be
fair, though, I feel I must explain before getting involved.
     Even with all these difficulties, I do not regret being
bisexual.   My  experiences  have  taught  me a lot.  I have
learned that there are rotten men and nice men; bitchy women
and  wonderful women. I have met straights who are extremely
open-minded, and gays who are bigots,  as  well  as  bigoted
straights  and  open-minded  gays.   Most of all, I have had
wonderful relationships with *people* -- regardless of their
gender.","8YwcNY8Z8GAJ",6,1985-08-27,-18,1

[ I'm replying to Alix Vasilatos's posting on Dr. Kinsey's
scale, part of the recent discussion on Bisexuality. ]
To me, the notion of a continuum of sexual preference is far better than
the hetero/homo/bi sexual categories which hardly seem to be of any
value.  Nevertheless, I think that the notion of some sort of linear
progression from Kinsey 0 to Kinsey 6 is still artificial, because of
the things it doesn't take into account.  The fantasy life of the mind,
subconscious desire, romantic desire, and erotic desire are all
distinct, (often achingly) real, and interconnected aspects of what we
might consider to be the sexual being: how can these be combined into a
single statistic?  On top of this we might include a sort of political
or social desire, to account for behavior ranging from a closeted gay
teenager going out with someone of the opposite sex in order to pass the
dreadful scrutiny of his or her peers to the practice of being outrageous
for purposes of societal consciousness-raising.
Moreover, there are intensities to be taken into account---consider
Alexander the Great, for whom women were in the arithmetic majority, but
for whom one man was unquestionably the erotic center of his life
(according to some interpretations: the argument is psychological, not
necessarily historical).  
I haven't thought a lot about this since I saw a man in a bar wearing a
``Kinsey 6'' T-shirt with his arm around a woman.  Jeepers, what's the
world coming to?

Of course I thought of this.  I just felt that Kinsey shouldn't be
left out in the beginnings of this sort of discussion.  Actually,
Anna Freud approached Kinsey's ""linear progression"" as something
which should only be applied to one's fantasies.  This has since been
shown to be unsupportable, by the number of declared homosexuals who
have fantasies about the opposite sex.  Of course, declared 
heterosexuals who have fantasies about the same sex are still 
accused of suppressed homosexuality.
I will always be in favor of allowing a person to be what she or 
he declares her or himself to be, especially if that choice is for
being something which makes them a member of a minority group,
brings them social grief, political grief, etc.  I would even go
so far as to applaud such a person.
By a wild twist of fate, I am heterosexually married and gay.
Both arrangements are quite happy, thank you.

Both are disliked by certain people, but not because of their dictionary
meaning.  ""Negro"", after all, is a simple cognate via Spanish of the Latin,
""black"", but its relative disuse these days comes from its association with
its earlier use by non-blacks in an overwhelmingly racist society.  In the
same way, the word ""homosexual"", aside from its offensiveness to linguists,
being an unwieldly juxtaposition of Greek and Latin stems, is a relic of
late 19th century attitudes about human sexuality.  It has a rather stodgy,
dusty clinicalness about it which is inappropriate for everyday use.  You might
not mind being called ""heterosexual"" when the occasion calls for it (as in
the rare case to identify someone as NOT-""homosexual""), but gay people end
up living with the term all day long.
There seems nothing wrong with calling people the way they wish being
called.  ""Black"" has replaced ""negro"" in most American English, and
""gay"" for ""homosexual"" is making inroads.

Since being a homosexual is defined as a negative thing by many people,  it
would   be  surprising  if  the  word  ""homosexual""  didn't  have  negative
connotations associated with it.  On the other hand,  connotations  are  in
the eye (ear?) of the beholder, by definition.
I think ""Nazi"" originally stood for National Socialist Party (in German).

""Negro"" is from the Latin for ""black"".  It is considered insulting because
most of the people who used the word considered the sets of {All Negroes} and
{All Slaves} to be identical.  Any arbitrary word used would have gained the
same negative connotation (see ""connotation"" and ""denotation"" in your
dictionary).

From ""National Sozialistiche Deutsche Arbeiter Partei"" (National Socialist
German Workers Party).  Nowadays, typically the American Nazi Party (whose
formal name I don't recall). Rather a different case, in that true Nazis do
not object to being called Nazis, and some who object to being called Nazis
(such as the Klan) object only because they don't want the bad press, or
because of a brand-loyalty thing (much like Goodyear/Goodrich, I suppose),
not so much because of abhorrence.

Connotation and denotation again.  Some gay/homosexual people feel that the
term ""homosexual"" has gained too much perjorative use, and prefer to be
labelled with a word which is still neutral or even positive.  (Some feel that
the word is too clinical, much like being referred to as a ""humanoid"" might
grate on one's ears after a while).  Others don't feel so.
Most of the people I know to whom it would matter prefer to be called by name,
so I do. :-)

I've always objected to the word ''homosexual'' on linguistic grounds:
it doesn't convey the sense of ''attracted to'', but only the sense of
''the same sex''. For that reason, I marginally prefer ''homophile'', 
seems to have disappeared completely since Stonewall (along with the
North American Conference of Homophile Organisations, NACHO). 
It's ironic that the word ''homosexual'', which we quite correctly tag
as the mark of the oppressor, was coined by a Hungarian gay, Kertbeny,
as part of a plea for tolerance, and was popularised in English by
Havelock Ellis. I've often wished that Kertbeny, Ellis, and George 
Weinberg (the inventor of the word ''homophobia'') had been linguistically
more careful.
I used to use the standard etymological arguments about the origin of
the word ''gay'', but I've given up. To me, it's now a simple matter
of courtesy. If John Simon insists on talking only of ''homosexuals'',
then I can equally reserve the right to call him ''Dreedle Slushthumper'',
regardless of *his* wishes in the matter.","WwnOuUL-mJ4J",12,1985-08-16,0,1

From Latin nigrum, niger (black), through Spanish or Portuguese,
according to the OED.

There's some linguistic defense for the adjective when it's applied to
sexual acts, in which case it means ``acts involving/between members of
the same sex''.  But what does it mean to refer to a same-sex person?
Or a different-sex person?  (Other than my mad friend Frank, of course,
who tries to be of a different sex each day :-)).
Of course there are worse ways to refer to gay people.  My mother always
tells me to watch out at the laundromat for those ``intellectual fags.''
I assure her that I do...

A minor quibble -- My understanding is that the term faggot, as  slang  for
homosexual,  arose  because  homosexuals were used as fuel to burn witches.
""Bring me something foul enough to burn a witch."" was the  judicial  remark
that  supposedly  started  it  all. (Not very practical.  The human body is
relatively non-combustible, consisting mostly of water).

The *American Heritage Dictionary* reads as follows:  
	fag.got [1]  *n*. *Slang*.  A male homosexual.  
	[Origin unknown.]  
	fag.got [2].  Variant of *fagot*.  
	fag.ot  *n*.  Also *fag.got*.  1.  A bundle of twigs, sticks,
	or branches bound together.  2.  A bundle of pieces of iron
	or steel to be welded or hammered into bars.  ...  [Middle
	English, from Old French, from Italian *fagotto*, from
	Vulgar Latin *facus* (unattested), from Greek *phakelos*.]  
It does *not* appear that this story for the origin of the term
*faggot* for male gays or homosexuals (choose your favorite) is
generally accepted.

Well, that is one derivation. But note that in Britain ""fag"" is commonly
used to mean cigarette (originally seen as effeminate), as well as a
lower-class student in a ""public"" school who had to do menial tasks for
an upper-class student (I don't think the system is common now, but I
read lot of boarding school novels (a very popular children's genre
at least then) where the custom existed. One or both of these could well
have led to the current meaning of ""homosexual"". My copy of ""The American
Heritage Dictionary"" here at work lists ""origin unknown"" for ""fag[got]""
as meaning ""A male homosexual"". The derivation from ""burning or being
burned as witches"" seems like folk etymology again. [""homosexuals were
used as fuel to burn witches"" is course totally ridiculous - even in
the darkest Dark Ages no one was that dumb!] But I guess some people
find this latter derivation more useful to build up miltancy and
separatism...

You're wrong.  Its actual meaning is ""black"" (the colour).
""Negro"" is insulting because of its historical usage, that's all.
Though to me ""homosexual"" never seemed insulting.. this idea is new to
me upon just recently joining net.motss.  I never liked it though, because

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Two columns on 'The Dilemma of Serological Testing']
:
[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]
:
  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

If the gays pioneered a yuppie lifestyle, perhaps AIDS is living
proof that gay's ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" attitude
eventually WILL lead to their destruction, just as a yuppie
lifestyle woven only of materialism (and NOT sexually transmitted
lethal diseases) leads to a society devoid of spiritual consciousness.
Another problem is differentiating between yuppies and preppies.
Not an important problem, mind net, but a problem nonetheless.
Sure, bermudas from Beans can be construed as prep, but do they
wreak of yuppie? Somehow prep is more of a socially accepted
term, and yuppie is definitely derogative.

Maybe I'm just a little slow today.  Would you care to rephrase
this argument in two or more sentences?  That way I can attempt to
follow what appears to be, in this form, a completely disjointed
morass of sanctimonious assertions.
On a different note, I'd be interested if someone could tell me
where the term ""yuppie"" originated (i.e. who first used it?  Time
Magazine or the like?)  The first time I remember hearing it was
on a Mark Russell comedy special a couple of years ago.

to have the puzzling null hypothesis that homosexuality and behavior

""learned"" by participation in homosexual acts.  Most gay people I
know realize their sexual preference well before they have any
opportunity to express it, and we all know about early-teenage
experimentation with same-sex peers, the outcome of which seems
totally unrelated to an individual's eventual sexual preference.
Not that I think nature/nurture arguments are irrelevant, but it
certainly seems that this study is asking the wrong questions.

Why is it so obvious that homosexuality isn't inherited?  It could be
inherited as a recessive trait or a predisposition, or some combination,
or am I wrong?
Now, if homosexuals never had children, any inherited trait would, it
seems, have left the gene pool.  But they do--not that it would require
one of one's parents to be homosexual for a predisposition to be
inherited. We have no difficulty accepting that heterosexuality is
largely inherited (we assume it comes with sex and sexuality, but
the link may not be as strong as we once  believed).

You are right that some homosexuals do have children, and that if
it were inheritable homosexuality could be a recessive trait.  But
that would mean that the children of homosexuals would have a
higher incidence of homosexuality that the population at large.
(I have no data there).  If there were a gene responsible, it
would be eventually driven out because of the relatively few number of
homosexuals who reproduce.

Probably thrown out once the sociological evidence began to be considered.
Though there are a great many gay people to be found in urban settings,
many have moved to the city from suburban or rural areas as a consequence
the greater opportunities and illusion of tolerance (q.v. Ron Rizzo's
article.)  Simply put, there don't seem to be more gay people born per
capita in, say, New York City than in all of New York state.
This ""population density stress"" theory comes, if I'm not mistaken, from
the experimental studies made with rats and overcrowding, where one
observed lordosis and copulative behavior between same-sex pairs of
rats.  Of course, one also noticed cannibalism and other aberrations;
why one would choose to link these highly artificial results with
the behavior of gay people is an interesting study in the sociology
of scientific research.
It's worth asking one more time what attitudes lie behind the question
""What causes homosexuality?""

What I don't understand is why we're just talking about homosexuality.
Heterosexuality seems to me to be a much more widespread and pernicious

The problem goes fairly deep.  The wrong questions are being posed.
Sophie Quigley's right when she says that on the face of things the
most problematic fact is why do there appear to be so many heterosexuals?
All of the hypotheses put forward to ""explain"" homosexuality (prenatal
stress, recessive genes, etc.)
are invidious ones containing an implicit idea of homosexuality as an
exception or deviation from a norm of nature, even if no moral or psycho-
logical censure is intended.  Even the seeming accident of the pun in
the phrase ""recessive gene"" is not entirely unrelated to the bias that
motivates the kind of questions that netters have asked.
The issues you choose to discuss and the terms in which they're discussed
are important, apart from any considerations of how rational, inspired,
or conscientious the discussion is.  It may seem silly to netters for us
to criticize this seemingly harmless, even well-intended discussion, but 
the kind of more subtle & indirect reinforcement of attitudes that occurs
by the choice of topic & its treatment is probably as important as the more
explicit & direct kind.  For example, I've come to believe that debates
about homosexuality hinging on sexual practices or gender roles probably
keep alive stereotypes as much as they promise to dispel them.
I don't mean to say stop talking about the topic, but only to urge people
to make a real effort to be aware, of the topic, their opinions, themselves
& the environment.  The biology invoked so far could stand improvement; it's
suffered probably because a social issue's involved.

Last year a woman was telling me about how, when she was pretty young (like
single digits), she walked into a room to find an unfamiliar woman stark
naked.  For some reason, it really startled and upset her.  I said ""A-HA!
*That's* why you're heterosexual.  You had a negative experience with a
woman when you were young.""  Funny, but she didn't take me seriously....

This is a real question, I don't understand why Puerto Rican's want to be so
visible either, or blacks (who already are based on their skin color). I
guess I can see why Blacks should be visible.
My point is, discrimination based on race is currently illegal. If someone
actually does it they can get into BIG trouble. This gives the individual
black (or hispanic) a great deal of power. I question whether this is
reasonable. Certainly I don't condone discrimination, but I feel that one
must show a need for the law before one can go making laws. Discrimination
based on non-job-related things *should* be illegal period. You shouldn't
lose your job because you are a smoker, for example. Gay's are in a similar
position. They are different than straights because they don't share the
same sexual situations. So what. Single men and women don't share the same
sexual situations (i.e. committment) as married couples do either.

I can give one explanation and it has nothing to do with the idea of ""flaunting""
one's sexuality.  Once an individual decides (for whatever reason which could
include potential attempted blackmail) to come totally out of the closet, the
individual will often feel not only embarassed, but guilty that they have been
somehow dishonest with their friends, family, and co-workers by having kept
their true feelings hidden for so many years.  It is not particularly easy
to face up to this situation, but having finally done so, the individual wants
to never again deceive anyone else.
It is not a matter of saying, ""I want you to accept my lifestyle,"" but rather
saying, ""I am gay, I don't want to deceive you, I'm not asking for your approval
but I do want you to learn about my sexual orientation from me rather than
from a third-party.""  In effect, the individual is trying to say, I want you
to be my friend, and I think that I should be up front with you;  if you
can not accept me, I understand, but the probability of being hurt has been
sharply reduced for both parties.
I speak from experience.  I find myself in just this type of situation.
Initially, I felt it necessary to finally be honest with so many people
who I had deceived for so long.   And now, before I mislead a potential
friend, I want them to know the truth.
I have found that the reaction to my candidness has been *extremely*
positive.  The number of negative experiences could be counted on one
hand.  And as I have said, it is not an attempt to flaunt my sexuality
nor change anyone's mind, but what I consider to be nothing more than
saving a friend from a potentially embarassing situation.  i.e. ""Do you
know that j.r. is gay?""  response: ""Oh yes, but it doesn't seem to be
an issue in our friendship.""  
I'm sure that many do not agree with my attitude, nor do I suggest that
this would work for everyone, but my very positive experiences with
this approach has worked well with my friends, (both old and new.)

all derive from being in love, showing affection, etc. and gay people
quite naturally like to take advantage of this.  It gives them the
same good feeling which openly blatant heterosexuals have enjoyed

On another level, it is also necessary for gays to be visible simply because
not being visible denies their existence:  it's altogether too easy for
people to cling to their ill-conceived stereotypes, to argue that
""there's no problem with gays and discrimination"", to think that they've
never met a gay person if all gay people adopt a straight-jacketed role

I do feel sorry for those who are offended by ""blatant"" gays--certainly

It is important to be able to proudly state that one is gay because
it is not an easy accomplishment.  And, Why should it bother anyone?
If someone finds homosexuality disgusting, is it my problem?  People
should just know that gay people exist, and if they're going to be
disgusted every time they become aware of some gay person, then,
they're going to be disgusted a lot.  I don't expect straights to
keep their sexuality a secret.  The details of their sex-life are
another matter.  Somehow, people seem to vividly associate being
gay with certain particular acts.  When you tell someone you're gay
they almost act as though you're suddenly wearing the most intimate
details of your sex life on your shirt.  Now why is that?
I see my visibility as directly relating to a reduction in oppression
that other, more closeted, gay people endure.  It's a matter of politics.
If ""they"" don't think there are that many people that will take offense
at discrimination against gay people, then ""they"" will discriminate.
""Gays? Gays!  I don't see any gays!""
When I recently went to post a housemate wanted ad in the company's weekly
bulletin, I couldn't.  I had used the word gay in my ad.  That isn't the
point.  The point is when I asked about it, I was told that this was the
first time anyone had ever tried to use the word gay.  Almost makes it
look like noone gay has ever worked here before.  Almost makes it look
like being gay is some incredibly rare event.  Well, it's not.  Nearly
everyone has a gay cousin.

All around me everyday, I see indications of heterosexuality.  Why
shouldn't I, just as casually, give evidence of my homosexuality.
Because it's nearly impossible.  A straight couple in the back of a
suburban theater smooching aren't flaunting anything.  A gay couple
however . . .  
""Flaunt"" should be defined.  I often find that there is a double
standard; just bringing my gayness into awareness is sometimes
considered ""flaunting it.""  Straight people rarely make a big
secret of their sexuality, why should I?
Also, there are lots of times when my sexuality it just assumed
to be straight.  It doesn't always bother me.  But likewise, it
shouldn't be an issue if I point out the error.  If someone assumed
I drank whole milk, and I pointed out that I drank lowfat milk,
that should not be any cause for concern.

Actually, it isn't that I want to stand up to proclaim my sexuality before
the world, it is that I do not wish to be bound by any restrictions which
are not applied to *all*.  Straight people think nothing of walking down
the street holding the hand of a motos, why should I be forced to have to
think about wether or not I will be killed for walking down the street
holding the hand of a motss.  Why shouldn't I take my 'other half' to

Well, blacks have nowhere near made up from the the effects of the
discrimination against them, they are still paying in that their
unemployment is higher, for example.  Neither have gays, except
perhaps arround the major gay centers like LA, NYC, and SF.  Even
in these ""Mecca's"" one is more likely to be killed or have other
""personal"" crimes (as opposed to purely ""property"" crimes) committed
against one.  I agree that (skin color/sexual orientation/religion/
marital status/sex) shouldn't make any difference, but untill everyone 
agrees on that fact, it does make a difference.

If I am expected to hide my lover from everybody, I won't be there.
Or another way of putting it is to change every ""gay"" in your above
paragraph to ""straight"".  Do straight people consider it to be
flaunting it when they walk down the street holding hands?  Well,
I don't either.
That's it for now,

Hang on here.  I think your analogies are inappropriate.  It's more like
advertising for a female or male roommate.  Suppose I (being female) don't
want to live with some strange male, so I put in an ad for a female roommate?
Is there something wrong with this?  I would say that this is reasonable.

I don't see the relevance of this.  I also think that it is unlikely that
people would *bother* trying to advertise for a partner in the classifieds,
since the personals exist for such purposes, and anyone who might be avail-
able/interested would certainly look in the personals rather than the
classifieds.

No, nor ads like ""Car for sale by straight female.""  The thing here is not

Yes, it most definitely serves a purpose.  I know that I feel that I should
have who I like as a roommate.  If I happen to want a 7' redheaded female
roommate, I should be able to search for one.  After all, *I* am the one that
has to live with this person.  In the same way, the prospective roommate
should have a choice as to me.  The purpose of an ad like this is to get
the desired type of person applying.  It might be argued that it is more
appropriate to screen the people when they apply, but it is more work, and
as in my analogy above, people *do* advertise for, say, only women to even
bother applying, so that less time gets wasted by both parties.

""Vegetarian M seeks same to share apartment...""
or maybe
""Non-smoker seeks same, M or F to share house...""
or maybe
""Roommate wanted, no pets.""
and even
""Christians sought to share communal fellowship...""
Of course not.  It is no less appropriate to identify oneself as gay
or specify that one is looking for a gay roommate.  This prescreens
the audience.  Homophobic straight people or those who are simply
uncomfortable need not apply.  As for the potential for harassment,
it depends on the enviroment--I am sure Robert has taken that into
account (and in any event, at least in the New England high-tech
professional corridor, it doesn't appear to be an issue.)  Her attempt
to demean the desire to to live with compatible people, with her neo-
liberal ""why should it be an issue at all?"" is a slap in the face to
gay people.
When the new age arrives, I'm sure it won't be a big issue anymore
to have to state one's sexual preference in a roommate ad.  But until
that comes, the fact is that many straight people are uncomfortable
dealing with gay people, especially in a roommate situation.  It is
a waste of both parties' time to let an inquiry get as far as a phone
call.  Better to let everyone know up-front.

If statutes against sex-preference discrimination become the norm, as I

Sounds like my response to Evelyn pressed one of Tim's pre-programmed
buttons.  I would save the tirade against religion for another more
appropriate newsgroup.  What *IS* true in the context of this discussion
is that a personal characteristic such as sexual orientation is as
legitimate a discriminant when making a housing choice as vegetarianism,
gender, smoking, keeping kosher, liking loud music, or even (gasp) religion,
if one cared enough about it.
There is nothing illegal about an individual making private decisions
about whom they wish to live with or associate with.  Some of those
might be repugnant to some (discrimination based on race or religion),
others morally neutral.  I am thankful, however, that we don't have
the government that Tim thinks we have, where individual ""right
thinking"" and ""right behavior"" are legislated.  To belabor the
obvious, I am not addressing discrimination by public and private
*institutions*, nor the moral illegitimacy of such discrimination.
More than anything else, I am appalled at the more general controversy
(raised entirely by straights here) who would claim that explicitly
seeking a gay roommate is not only a non-issue but actually morally
wrong!  They of course would not think twice about using any of the
issues mentioned above as criteria in choosing friends, roommates
and lovers.

What the Hell are you talking about?  I am deeply religious; I am even the
moderator of a religious mailing list.  (And unlike your religion, mine
embraces homosexuality and bisexuality.)  What ""tirade"" are you referring
to?  Protesting discrimination based on religion is a ""tirade against
religion""?
Obviously my name has pressed one of the ""pre-programmed buttons"" in Steve's
tiny little mind.  My advice, Steve: First pull your head out of your ass.
Then (maybe) you'll be able to pull the beam out of your eye.

Since those are not equally legitimate, the sentence is meaningless.  Let me
spell it out for you: If someone said ""White roomates only need apply"", or
""Bisexual roommates only need apply"", or ""Thelemite roommates only need
apply"", I would consider that person a fool and a bigot, despite the fact
that I am a white bisexual Thelemite.  Anyone who gets offended by a
roommate's religion, color, or sexual preference is an asshole, and has no
moral right to discriminate based on his bigotry.

More meaningless yow-yow arguments.  You are probably right concerning the
legalities involved, unfortunately.  But if asking the government to forbid
prejudicial discrimination by individuals is 1984-style, then I suppose Paul

I see.  Now I'm straight.  Thanks for reversing my sexuality as well as my
religion, Steve.  What IS your problem?
As I have said, you are entirely wrong about my own willingness to make
decisions on the basis of bigotry and prejudice.  Not only am I unwilling to
do so, I have no desire at all to do so.
Nor do I write knee-jerk replies to messages based solely on my prejudices

when all we ever did was argue about religion and our right to be
human.  Anyway, the original ad, that sparked this conversation read
like this:
    HOUSEMATE - Male (gay), 22, seeks 2 housemates
    (male or female) for 3 bedroom ranch at the
    Billerica end of the Middlesex Turnpike; 4 miles
    from MITRE.  ALL utilities included (Bay State

    with fur.  Available early April, $325/month.
    Call Robert, x2260 or 369-1848 after 5 p.m.
As you can see, I wasn't excluding straights.  However, I would really
rather live with a gay person.  Discrimination you say?  Not really.
It's more like an all-girls school.  Right Now, in my life, I could
use a few examples of gay men.  I live out in the suburbs and my contact
with other gay people is somewhat limited.
There are certain things that I can count on from almost any gay person,
that I can't count on from some of my straights friends.  Sometimes, my
straight friends can inadvertently make me feel real shitty about being
gay.  I don't know that they mean it; but let me give you an example:
	I was over at a friend's room in his frat house the other day.
	He knows I'm gay.  I recently told one of his roommate's that
	I'm gay.  I think my friend's roommate is a real cutie, but I
	don't know if he'd ever consider romance with a gay man.  Any-
	way, the cutie answered the phone.  We were listening and his
	tone of voice was real formal.  At one point he said something
	like ""I look forward to that very much.""  To this my friend
	commented (though not directly to me) ""Yeah, he sounds like he
	looks forward to that about as much as having a hot stick shoved
	up his ass.""
Now, I never quite know how to deal with comments like that.  And something
tells me that if I had a gay roommate, I wouldn't have to worry about things
like that.  Would anyone deny me the right to live with others of my kind?
You know, being gay in a predominantly straight environment can be
lonely.  That experience I just described happened last night.  This
net is really the only place I can talk about it.  Oh, sure, I could
give my best gay friend in New York a call; but he's usually out or
sleeping on the weekends.  And I've got some gay friends in Beantown,
I could call one of them up and tell them.  But how much nicer it would
be to be able to come home and cry on a sympathetic roomies shoulder.
O.K., you got that?  You see, there are good reasons for being allowed
to choose whom you live with.  And just because I might only want to
live with a certain kind of roommate doesn't make me an asshole.  It
just means that right now I maybe don't have the fortitude or stamina
to justify my existence on a daily basis.

Robert, what an interesting story and discussion.  First, I agree
with the posting of your ad.  You have every right to decide who
you want to share your life and in taking on a roommate. 
You should know that you are protected under the 14 admendment in terms 
of freedom of choice (an overused phrase) unless, of course, there 
are more than two of you and depending on your local housing laws I'm afraid
you might have to take on a non-gay.  Nothing would stop you of
course by letting the applicants know that you are gay.  There are
cases available on this very subject but lets talk about another
problem which seems all too real.  Bob, I can relate to your being
lonely as the only gay person in your enviornment.  I am black and
am often times the only non-white.  My problem goes even deeper
because I can never hide it or pretend not to be black.  Can you
imagine me telling someone that I am (what a joke - those of us who
make confessions are always the last to know what everyone else
already knew.) However I
am very proud of my blackness and it is always there for me, yet,
it is not an issue in my ""everyday life.""  Sure there are comments
that people make but, I guess as a group (blacks) and as an
individual we have learned to take these comments in stride.  For instance
when someone use the word NIGGER it has no affect.  When you feel
good about yourself words and phrases like this tend to loose its punch.  
Where am I going with this you ask?  Well your story about your friend
sounded very interesting but he only implied that the person on the
phone does not enjoy ""hot sticks up his ass."" And frankly Robert
I cannot think of anyone who would.  In any case, he simply did not
enjoy talking to whomever it was on the phone and he certainly did
not want to be about the event he agreed to participate. Lets not
be too sensitive about our sexuality.  I enjoy a good group of
friends here in San Diego that are nonjudgemental and comprise a good
cross section of Americana.  We celebrate every holiday!  If your
frat friend is a true friend, and I'm sure he is, enjoy being with
him as he enjoys being with you and who knows....Oh never mind that
will simply be another problem for you.  Take care.  Raynard","bxMiFY0BPTEJ",19,1985-04-19,5,1

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

From Science 84, December 1984.
	""Biological basis for homosexuality?""
Stony Brook, NY. - Some homosexual men have been shown for the first time
to differ from heterosexual men in the way they respond to hormones.
Researchers at the State University of New York say that their study could
be a significant step in answering the long-debated question of what
determines sexual orientation.
Twenty-nine heterosexual men and women and 14 homosexual men were injected
with the female hormone estrogen.  As expected, the heterosexual men's
hormonal systems responded to the estrogen much differently than the women's.
The homosexual men, however, responded in a pattern between that of the
heterosexual men and women.  Psychobiologist Brian Gladue, one of the
researchers, cautions that this hormonal difference is hardly a reliable
test of someone's sexual orientation.  ""It only starts us looking more closely
at human sexual development,"" he says.
Previous studies have shown that hormones seem to affect many types of
behavior, even in young children not yet infludenced by social conditioning.
Research with animals suggests that some differences between the sexes --
females' tendency to be less violent, for instance -- are shaped by
hormones that begin affecting the brain even before birth.  Gladue believes
that biological factors may also predispose someone to be homosexual.
""A lot of people think that homosexuality is a societal phenomenon caused
by factors like an absent father or a domineering mother,"" Gladue says.  ""It
would be a major leap to say that the orientation is established at birth,
but if people are willing to accept that heterosexuality is already
determined, why not homosexuality?""

sample size - 14 gay men is not a very large population, and the
	      number of gay men who actually demonstrated an 
	      exceptional reaction to the administration of
	      estrogen was smaller--9 is the figure I remember.
screening   - There was no screening for factors like drug use
	      which could have a large effect on hormonal
	      responses.  Given the population from which they
	      selected their subjects (gay bars in urban
	      settings) this is worrysome.
selection   - There were no gay women in the study, a glaring
	      omission explained away, rather lamely, by the
	      researchers asserting that they couldn't find any
	      gay women (sounds like they weren't asking the
	      right people.)  Certainly, a demonstrable difference
	      from the baseline by gay people of both sexes
	      would have strengthened any conclusions they
	      might make.
As someone trained as a scientist, I am fascinated by basic research, but
it is also useful to remember the political and social contexts in which
scientific research, however ""pure"", operates.  Where might we go from
here?  Suppose that one's primary sexual orientation is linked to the
morphology of certain brain structures, that these structures differ from
the norm in people with an affinity for the same sex, and that it is shown
that hormonal changes in the mother during fetal development influence the
ultimate morphology of the child's brain, and thus exerts a strong
influence on the child's sexual preference?  This is not too far-fetched
a theory, and the experiment mentioned above is a first step in data
collection.
What is thought to be benign, or even benevolent, individual variance in one
culture, or at some point in time, may be considered ""bad"", ""evil"", or a
problem, in other cultures, or at other points in time.  Unfortunately, if
society finds a ""cause"" for a event which is considered a problem, it
immediately suggests the existence of a ""cure.""  For comparison, look at the
attitudes of Victorian society towards masturbation and many of the often
hilarious, and sometimes chilling ""cures"" for this ""affliction.""  Though the
strides of the gay rights movement in the past 15 years are well-recognized,
I think it is safe to claim that there is a very very long way to go, and
that same-sex sexual orientation is still classified by many as a ""problem.""
Even if one feels that a purely biological view of sexual behavior is
hopelessly reductive and unprofitable when taken out of the laboratory, many
will grasp at anything blessed with the imprimatur of ""science"" and use it in
the formulation of policy.
Let's examine the possible ""cures"" which might result if this research
in the biological bases of sexual preference bore fruit:
- during pregnancy, a woman is noted to have the hormonal changes which
  predispose her child to homosexual behavior (surely a simple home
  screening test of blood, urine or salive might be prepared.)  She
  decides to have an abortion on the basis of this finding.
- a woman with a previous history of this hormonal variance is treated by
  her gynecologist to ensure that this does not occur during her next
  pregnancy.
- a child is born, the mother was notified of this hormonal variation
  during her pregnancy, and it is noted on the child's medical record.
  What effect will this have on the parents in their care and raising of
  the child, given the societal mores which indicate this is a significant
  enough problem that it should be measured at all?  What effect will this
  biological ""marker"", or Scarlet Letter, have on the child's own self-
  esteem, integration into society and ultimate sexual behavior?
The issue here is not scientific knowledge or technology, but their use as
tools to implement what society feels is ""good"", often to the detriment of
individual variation and freedom.  It is incumbent upon people to speak
against such goals when they are voiced, to question their underlying
assumptions, and to continue the goal of education, to help persuade people
otherwise when they describe same-sex sexual orientation as a ""problem""
which needs to be cured.

Reality is the women have a right to an abortion for whatever reason.
Women may also choose the sex of their child by abortion, abort
Down's Syndrome fetuses, and even abort because it isn't desired
to have a child (yet).  In any case, the right to an abortion (in
the first trimester) is UNCONDITIONAL.
Are you questioning this right or what?  You are hereby sentenced to
10 months of reading net.abortion.
Furthermore, a woman may not want homosexual offspring because she
hopes to be a grandmother someday.  Granted that heterosexual children
are no guarantee of this, but it is not in the mother's interest to have
homosexual children in that case.

Women (with the co-operation of their husbands) also adjust the
times and conditions for intercourse to adjust the probability of
having a child of the desired sex. (Also see previous argument).

Children (almost all!) are born either male or female.  This has far
greater impact on their upbringing than any other characteristic.
Moreover the sex of the fetus can be known long before birth, so even
then the mother's behavior is altered by that knowledge.  It may not
be fair or just, but that's the way it is.  We are all raised this way.
Some males grow up to be feminists and defenders of the
rights of homosexuals.  Some females grow up to be
mathematicians, politicians and construction workers.  Obviously, then,
the characteristics of a child at birth does not force specific
roles on that child as an adult.

The future of humanity is in the hands (wombs) of women, as it always
has been.  Your arguments sound surprisingly like those of the ""right
to life""-ers, as though homosexual fetuses (?) have a right to life
despite the mother's wishes.
You even allude to avoiding such investigation into the causes of
of homosexuality, given your arguments above.  Is this really the
voice of someone ""trained as a scientist,"" or a political rhetorician
in disguise?  Why do you seem to be afraid to investigate the
question at all?
I am not saying that skewing the ""randomness"" of births is good or bad;
it is simply a decision that is out of our (men's) hands when we resign the
rights of reproduction to a woman's choice,  and I defend that right.

response.  In any event, you didn't understand my point at all, which
wasn't an attack on abortion rights, nor a plea to avoid scientific
investigation.  One needn't have to question the rights of women to have
abortions if one is to examine societal mores, their effects on individual
decisions, and the subsequent cumulative effect of these decisions on
society.  The fact that one of my examples used an abortion was simply
reflecting reality, since that would doubtlessly be one approach towards
solving the ""problem"" of having a child who had a good chance of turning
out gay.
Since the gay topic seems to be a red flag of sorts, let's examine the
situation that you use to buttress your replies: the ability for parents
these days to choose the sex of their child.  Some feminists are becoming
concerned by this, because overall, boys are preferred to girls.  Let's say
that this choice became the norm, and with the result of all these
cumulative decisions on the sex of a child, we begin to see a significant
shift in the sex ratio of births in the U.S., and a resulting change in
demographics.  Is it not appropriate for those concerned to speak out about
this, to ask people to examine the underlying reasons for their choices, to
ask what this says about ""male"" and ""female"" in our society?  Doesn't this
present an enormous educational problem to those who disagree with this
trend?  Isn't it appropriate to discuss this BEFORE it becomes reality?
I submit that the analogous situation with gay people is even more
disturbing and more likely, and homophobia armed with biological means
could easily lead towards the eradication of gay people, or more likely,
to make a minority even smaller, to vitiate its power and presence in
society, and to contribute towards the homogenization of society by
removing those who are not like the majority.
Your comment comparing finding the ""marker"" for homosexuality before or at
birth with knowing the sex of the child makes sense only in a world without
sexism and homophobia.  My comments reflected the situation of someone
born in a world which is fearful enough of homosexuality that it finds it
necessary to measure it during pregnancy.

Sorry, gam, the future of humanity is in all our hands.  Anyone and

Well, hetero parents will, probably, always prefer a hetero baby;
gay parents will ... there aren't too many of those.
The reason is not necessarily the dreaded homophobia.
The word ""eradication"" sounds repulsive, sure, but nobody in particular
is getting eradicated. Lifestyles, habits, traditions, orientations, if 
you will, are continuously eradicated ih the course of history. 
If you want some tradition to continue, you should be able to show
that it is a good one. Whatever is your definition of goodness, it
must show.
To rephrase it: what are the world's merits of having gay population?
Why should gay (straight) tradition continue?
Yes, it creates charming diversity, own subculture, but is that enough 
of a merit to make parents upset about having a child that can not
fulfill their expectations? Again ""homophobia"" does not totally account
for that attitude.
Summary: you want gay tradition to be around forever, to be powerful.
But you are not just as concerned with costs of keeping it around,
as you are with possible disadvantages of doing away with it.
There are usual parallels with ethnic groups (of questional legitimacy)
I can understand the concern - you are a member of potentially threatened
minority - but most of these are not applicable.
Also: effect of changing male/female ratio are far more serious then
any possible changes in the percentage of gays. Why? It affects more
people more seriously.

If homosexual behavior were hereditary (it isn't) you might have
something to worry about.  The fact that the population of
(exclusive) homosexuals remains fairly constant (~10%, say), combined
with apparently environmental rather than hereditary contributing
factors, suggests that the abortion of ""potentially homosexual"" fetuses
will have a negligible effect on the total population of homosexuals.
(See also last paragraph).
Even more important is the definition of ""homosexual"" here.  In the
late 50's Kinsey said ""homosexual"" should be used to describe BEHAVIOR,
not people.  He also pointed out that sexual orientation is a continuum
rather than a clear division of ""straight/gay/bisexual"".  To eradicate
""potential homosexual behavior"" in males, then, would mean eradication
of approx 1/3 to 1/2 of all males.

It is a reasonable scientific endevor to question and investigate why
some people become sexually oriented to the same sex.  First, because
homosexuals are the exception, not the rule.  Second, because the need
for heterosexual behavior is fairly obvious -- ensuring reproduction.
I think you are expressing homophobia-phobia towards anything that
attempts to investigate homosexual behavior.

The research into the causes/origins of homosexual behavior does not
assume that is something to be cured.  It is an attempt at
understanding HUMAN behavior, in all its various forms.

I do not dictate to women what kinds of babies they should bear.  If
I were the father, I would certainly influence the choice, but I still
realize the choice is not mine.
I doubt that homosexuals can be eradicated any more than
females.  Clearly females are necessary for reproduction, but I also
believe (unfoundedly) that homosexuality exists for some natural reason,
(will you agree with that?)
and that whatever the imbalance -- male/female, homo/hetero --
Nature will restore that balance in time.
I think we are in fundamental agreement, Steve, but I have more confidence
in societal choice and natural controls.

Gordon, a couple of points: you are knocking down an argument which was
being assumed for the purposes of this thought experiment, so it isn't
strictly relevant.  That is, the reasoning goes this way:
1.) IF (big if) researchers found morphological differences between
    straight and gay people
2.) and IF they found the situation responsible for this difference
    (to name a few: genes, hormonal variance in utero, during
    childhood, whatever--it isn't important to the argument)
3.) wouldn't it be possible or even very likely that society would
    find a ""cure"" for the situation.
You forget, too, that something can be biologically based without
being hereditary.  Perhaps the Kinsey continuum of 1 (entirely
heterosexual) to 6 (entirely homosexual) is based on the level of
certain hormones during pregnancy, and that the natural variation
and fluxuation in all women ""causes"" the continuum.  Now, stepping
outside this discussion, I entirely agree with you, but that's not my
point.

I wasn't arguing against research.  I wasn't arguing against this particular
research.  I think it's fascinating.  Really.  What I was asserting is that
the results of any research can be misused.  We all know this, just look at
the bomb.  In this particular situation, I was presenting a thought experiment
of what MIGHT happen, given the history of our society and assuming that
current attitudes about gay people don't change significantly, and assuming
that a particularly reductive view of sexual preference gains evidence.
The points I make now will have to be made soon IF (big if) science can
ever point to ""causes"" for homosexual behavior.  It is important to get
people thinking EARLY about the consequences of technology and how it
can be used or misused.

It stems from my belief that our concepts of gender and of homosexuality
are culture bound.
There is a difference between biological maleness/femaleness and cultural
maleness/femaleness. To be a biological male is to have a certain biological
characteristics: certain sexual organs, certain genetic material, etc.
To be ""culturally"" male is to have those characteristics a particular culture
considers appropriate to males, i.e.  MASCULINE characteristics.
When I think of my own sexual orientation, it's not biological gender
but rather cultural gender that is a major factor in my sexual taste.
I am not attracted to all males (despite the rumors :-) ).
And then there are physical characteristics unrelated to biological and
cultural gender that are part of my sexual taste, e.g. hair color, height,
ability to carry on a conversation, intelligence, etc.
Furthermore, just because someone is attracted mainly/exclusively to say,
males, doesn't mean s/he is attracted to what s/he considers masculine.
Someone may be attracted to hairless males with slight builds but consider
burliness to be masculine (and not sexually attractive).
Sexual orientation involves a lot more than biological or even cultural gender.
But I think we categorize our sexual taste on the basis of gender
because our culture encourages us to categorize people on the basis of
gender.  Gender is one of the first things we notice about a person,
and in fact, we have a hard time ignoring gender.
Our culture (it seems to me) considers males and females more different than
they are biologically.
Our culture overemphasizes and exaggerates the differences between males
and females. In another culture where maleness and femaleness were not
exaggerated beyond the biological, I would suspect that
gender would play less of a role in one's sexual orientation.
And sexual tastes would not be so simply categorized on the basis
of the gender of the sex object.
So my first suspicion of claims of a biological basis of sexual orientation
is that sexual orientation seems to me to be mostly culturally based.
Secondly, different cultures seem to have different notions of homosexuality.
In many Mediterranean cultures,  I am told, one is considered to be homosexual
if one is a male who is sexually ""passive"" with other males. A male who
inserts his penis in another male is NOT considered to be homosexual.
The category of homosexuality seems to be a cultural category.
So before we start entertaining the possibility of a biological basis
of sexual orientation, we'd better make sure that we are not looking for
a biological basis for a category created by/in our culture. Permit me to
exaggerate: looking for a biological basis for homosexuality is like
looking for a biological basis for preferring a rural lifestyle to
an urban one.

I think the answer to that are pretty obvious:
1/ stop in growth of world population (overall)
2/ acceptance of different ways of loving people (and not mere replacement of
one kind for the other either.  There ARE some bisexuals around too!)

I don't think that Steve is worried about the continuation of gay ""tradition""
but the impact on the gay population that the ease with which homosexuality
could be prevented in utero would have.  Another analogy can be drawn with
these proposed devlopments and the development of other methods to determine
abnorbalities in fetuses.  The reason amniocentecis (sp?) is performed is not
in order to cure potentially ""damaged"" fetuses in utero, but rather to give
parents of such fetuses the opportunity to have an abortion.  Now, of course,
retardation, birth deffects, etc, will never be erradicated, but if it becomes
a common practice to ""cure"" such problems by abortion, then society will
probably be less compassionate towards people who refuse the ""cure"" and their
offsprings.  This issue is apparently causing great concern in groups for
disabled people.
While I am certainly not in favour of restricting women's right to abortion
for any reason (and anybody who reads net.abortion can attest to this)  I am
worried about the impact of the widespread acceptance of abortion of deformed
fetuses.  Like many of the pro-lifers, I too am worried that people might
abort problem fetuses just because there are no societal structures in place
to support disabled people.  And it is a vicious circle: it becomes easier
to abort those fetuses rather than accept them into our society, and as there
are less and less of them, the ones that are there are not as easily accepted
or can even be blamed (or their parents can be) for existing in the first
place, and thus refused assistance that they might have been given if they
were a more visible minority.
I think there is a parallel with this situation and the problem of ""detecting""
people's homosexuality in advance.  If homosexuality is seen as undesirable,
and can be detected earlier on, and people can ""cure"" it by aborting would-be
homosexuals,  and this becomes common-place, then existing homosexuals will
certainly not be tolerated as well by society.

That is all a matter of opinion!  One possible side-effect of drastic
changes in male/female ratios would be an increase in homosexuality so
it is all related.
****** FLAME ON ******
How can you DARE say that the problems that heterosexual people might
have in finding mates might be more ""serious"" than problems homosexuals might
encounter because of discrimination!  Seems to me that food & shelter
are much more basic needs than sex and companionship.
This kind of attitude really pisses me off!!!!  I find it SOOOOO reminiscent
of the usual crap that men used to feed women about how men's worries were
so much more ""serious"" than women's worries, and how men's work was so much
more ""serious"" than women's work...  etc.. ad infinitum.  And usually in
this kind of situation, the truth was that those who were concerned about
""seriousness"" could afford to do so because they had free time on their hands
unlike those who were spending all their lives working at less ""serious""
tasks such as making sure that their families did not starve.
Your attitude is so patronising, it is disgusting!  Just because a concern
is not yours, then immediately it is less serious, and just because a
concern is shared by a majority of people, then it happens to be more
serious then other concerns minorities might have.  Yes, I bet there are
more people in the world who are worried about sex than there are who are
starving (or are things worse than I think they are?).  I guess that makes
the problems of the starving people less ""serious"" too by your definition.

followups.  Steve asked a question that was disturbing to me because, no
matter how hard I tried, I could not answer it for myself.  His question
(paraphrased) was, ""What would you do if you found out, while your child
was in the womb, that he/she was homosexual?""  (Actually, he asked it in
a general way and I took it personally because I believe that that's the
best way to approach any theoretical problem.)
Suppose I'm pregnant and have a routine amnioscentesis (sp?) done for
whatever reason.  Without my asking, the doctor volunteers the informa-
tion that my child is a boy with genetic ""homosexual tendencies."" (This
is in Steve's scenario; I'm not just finding a farfetched story here!)
Like it or not, and with all my best *intellectual* intentions over-ridden
by gut instinct, you can bet that I'm going to treat him differently.  I'm
not going to *want* to, mind you, but I'm human.  I will have been told
that he's 'different' and that will affect me, as I assert that it would
affect anyone in that situation.  I'm already scared to death of raising
a child because I want him/her to be non-sexist, peace-loving, non-racist,
non-homophobic, non-anything-bad, etc.  (In other words, perfect.)  *Now*
I'm faced with trying to provide my son a non-heterosexual-stereotypical
upbringing and I have no experience.  How many words/actions/thoughts/values
that we pass on to our children assume that they are heterosexual?  All.
I would probably turn to all my gay friends and ask them, ""What would you
like to have heard and how would you like to have been treated when you
were growing up?  Anything different?""
And therein lies the other problem.  I don't want to treat my son
'differently'.  I want him to be like any other kid, for his sake.  I also
don't want to make any false assumptions on his behalf about his sexual
preference based on some hormonal test performed before he was born.  I
know a man (my old roommate) who was gay from the age of 14 to the age
of 22 and then decided he was straight again.  I don't know why he decided
to be straight again, but I do know that he decided to be gay because he
was told by his gay sister and her gay husband (none of my business why
they married) *from the time he was about 5 years old* that he was gay.
I'm not making any judgements here and I'm not assuming that he was either
""really gay"" or ""really straight"" or somewhere in between.  All I know is
that he made (what he thought to be) a conscious decision to be gay because
he was told he was.  He decided later that it wasn't right for him.  How
did you all decide you were gay?  Was it your own decision?  All I'm
saying here is that I don't think it's the job of a parent to tell a child
what his sexual preference is.  Then again, don't they really do that
already by assuming everyone is heterosexual?
See why I'm confused?  Of course the problem doesn't exist for me, or for
anyone for that matter.  Not yet.  But Steve is right to bring it up for
discussion *now*, not when it's too late.  Remember that I'm someone who
wouldn't mind (I say now) a gay child; I just don't want to screw up his
upbringing.  What about the people who would really persecute a child
they thought was gay from birth on?
No answers, just questions.

which goes far beyond matters of biological gender or cultural
gender role.  This is not to deny that sexual orientation is a
profound facet of personality, perhaps as permanent as any other
facet (any personal trait can be changed; after all, torture
works), & as valid.  This is also not to ignore a lot of data
which suggest that most people are predominantly gay or straight
in North America, with a smaller middle group of bisexuals, or
to rule out in advance biological factors which may at least 
partly underlie this fact.  However, much of the discussion of
candidate biological factors that I've seen is mired in gender
stereotypes often peculiar to North America.
Sexual orientation is problematic, in all its variety.  Eg, why
are there heterosexuals at all?  The darwinian sketches of an
explanation I've heard seem meager, ad hoc, & not very confid-
ently advanced.
I think it's time (is net.motss the place?) to open a possible
pandora's box by making the case for homosexuality (& hetero-
sexuality, too?  I see ""procreation"" lingering like a ghost
around most people's attitudes toward it) as a matter of totally
voluntary choice.  I should seek out not only sexual but emotional
relationships with people of the same sex (or the opposite sex)
simply because I WANT TO, FEEL LIKE DOING SO, & to HELL with any
other justification!  & society, law, etc. should SUPPORT these
choices as they have those of hetero-not-too-sexual monogamy cum
marriage.
(I assume most readers of net.motss understand ""orientation vs.
preference"" and don't entertain the silly notions of homosexuality
implicit in American homophobia -- that it's temporary, a result
of peculiar formative influences, pseudo-feminity/masculinity etc.
I also assume readers don't regard heterosexuality as god-given,
natural, more valuable, etc.)

I'll bite.  Given that the homosexual (it could also be any person,
Christian, Jew, Moslem, Atheist, Bahai, heterosexual or any-other-sexual
you can imagine) does not disrupt work by bringing their personal
ideosyncracies into the workplace, then they should win the suit.
Simple enough?
The funny thing, Brunson, is that you probably have non-heterosexuals
(interesting word) working for you now, or will have them working
for you in the future and you won't know it.  I'd also guess that
there are lots of people you'd refuse to hire thinking they were gay
who, in fact, are not.  It's ironic that you aren't discriminating
on the basis of sexual preference, but on the basis of honesty.
(Unless, of course, you're given to creeping and peeping around
folks bedrooms at night in which case you are definitely due for
a spell in the slammer.)

To answer your question, the person who refuses to hire homosexuals
should lose, and the homosexual should win.  ""Should"" means that, in
my opinion, this is what I believe is more just.
The problem is that the employer wishes to hire only people who he/she is
comfortable having around, while the person looking for work wishes to
have access to any job based only on their ability, not the personal
preferences of the employer.  I believe that it is more important for
the employee to be protected from discrimination than it is for the
employer to be allowed to discriminate.

The fact that it is a Bible believer who is the discriminator is irrelevant.
When I say ""Bible believer"" most people will assume that I mean a Jerry-Falwell-
Christian-Fundamentalist-Inerrancy-of-the-Scriptures-Prayer-in-Public-Schools-
Let's-Return-This-to-a-Christian-America-and-Beat-up-all-the-Gays-Blacks-and-

Make him a Jew or Moslem or Atheist or whatever you like.  Also
the statement ""Arguments concerning the rightness or wrongness of his position
are now irrelevant"" is not correct.  What I meant to say is that the dis-
criminator's motives are irrelevant.  That is, when you ask him the question,
""Oh come now, let's talk about this.  Why do you want to discriminate against
this harmless homosexual?"", anything that he says to defend his position
is independent of the moral question before the house, which is, once again,

Some person may refuse to accept the arguments of society that smashing
the windows of other peoples' cars is not a good thing to do.  In their
mind, the people who attempt to stop them from doing this are infringing
on their rights.  My response?  Tough.  Just because Bible-believing citizens
don't like gays doesn't mean we have to honor their views.  Just because they
think gays are, in a sense, criminals doesn't mean they are criminals.

Well, one thing I understand is that if you don't have anything worthwhile
to say, saying it at 150dB doesn't make it any more worthwhile.  Fine.
Nobody will change your mind.  I hope you realize that by abjuring reason,
you've probably blown your chances of changing anybody else's mind.  Indeed,
there is no ""nice-guy"" way to handle the problem.  Society either has to
be nasty to the ""Bible believers"" or to gays.  I think it should be nasty
to the ""Bible believers"".  Their actions directly and provably harm gays.
The gays' actions can only be shown to harm other people by swallowing
the ""Bible believers'"" anti-gay line hook, line, and sinker.  I operate -
and most of the people arguing the pro-gay position operate - on the principle
that enjoining someone from doing something that doesn't demonstratably harm
other people is *immoral*.  That's right, immoral.  We don't pussyfoot around
here; I'll pull out the tough expletives and use them here.  Therefore the
gay should win the suit, and the ""Bible believer"" should be condemned.
OK.  You probably dislike this conclusion.  Either 1) you have a *purely*
rational argument against it (""gays are doing themselves and others harm
because their action is a sin"" don't cut it) - in which case, please present
it or 2) you dislike it because it disagrees with a strongly- but not
rationally-held conviction of yours - in which case, you are probably turning
more people against you than you are convincing to support you, and you
are making a public nuisance out of yourself, so stop it.
> 
> David Brunson, making the net a more *decent* place to raise a family
Bullshit.  In your ideal world, I'd seriously consider getting my tubes
cut.  I'd not want to subject any child of mine to a world in which people
who disagreed with their values, without being demonstratably and objectively
harmed by the consequences of those values, could enforce their judgements
against their ways of life.  Gays *are* demonstratably and objectively harmed
by employment discrimination - it's hard to live without eating, and it's
hard to eat without being able to afford your food, and it's hard to be
able to afford food without getting paid by an employer.

This is the first time I'm posting to net.motss, so if I break some
protocol, tell me gently...ok???
Now I've been watching what's been going on here for a while and, frankly,
Brunson has a point.  (Alright, I'll put my asbetos suit on!).  Now, I don't
say I agree with him...I just say he has a point.
And here is a true to life situation.  You tell me what you would have
done:
I had a VERY nice contract with a fellow out in New Jersey (on the other
side of the river, I've been told!).  He required one full-time contract
programmer at his site for about three months.  So I showed him the resume
of a very good programmer who has worked for me in the past, and he said:
""Great!! This guy is just what I need...when can he start?"".  So my programmer
was hired to go out there and do the job.  He was out there for about
three hours when the client calls up and starts complaining loudly that
he ""doesn't need no fruits"" working for him.  So I asked him ""Why...what's
wrong....did he do something, ah, that you're uncomfortable with?"".
The client merely said that no matter how qualified the guy was, he didn't
want any homosexuals working for him.  Although he didn't put it quite so
politely.  Now the programmer, Ralph, happens to be overtly gay, and perhaps
a bit flamboyant about it, but he does excellent work.  I had a choice:
Push a point and lose $9,000 profit, or just tell poor Ralph that he has
to go BECAUSE HE IS GAY.  Which would you do??
I choose to pull Ralph off the assignment.  I have no problem with the
fact the Ralph is gay (although I'm not  ---  but some of my friends are :-) ).
But I have a problem with losing $9,000.
Now, before you flame at me:  Forget your sexual orientation.  What would
you have done.  Been noble and lost the money?  And was that guy wrong??
It was his money, and he does have the right not to have persons working
for him that would cause problems FOR ANY REASON with him.  I don't like
the client, but I feel that he does have that right.  And if he told me
that he wanted me to pull the new person off the project  (just for a laugh:
Toni is a qualified programmer -- and a lesbian!!) for any reason including,
but not limited to, that he didn't like the color of her eyes, I'd probably
pull Toni off the account, too.  Nobility is nice, but it doesn't pay
the rent.
Now if you want to flame at me, please do it by mail.  Then I'll
summarize as needed.

Naw, Brunson isn't Arndt in disguise. Arndt exhibited some degree of
intelligence on occasion. He read journals and periodicals and impressed
some of us with his facts and made others of us wonder why he reads so much
about homosexuals. Brunson would seem to think the bible (I refuse to
capitalize the word) is the ONLY book around. And quite frankly, Brunson
doesn't sound the least bit intelligent. I hope that he isn't raising a family,
'cause the world doesn't need more bible-thumping morons. So, David dear, if

I made this point in an earlier article, and the absence of such phrases
made be believe I had been successful.  I suppose it is more likely that
my message didn't get out.
I do not know of any Christian who does not believe in the Bible.  However,
many Christians I know do not consider homosexuals criminals, do not
believe in disciminating against them, do not believe they are sick and
need to be reformed.  Some Christians I know are gay, and are comfortable
with their God.
The fact is that very few generalizations can be made about believers in
the Bible.  There are very peaceful and quiet believers and there are
agressive (even violent) and missionary believers, and everything in
between (and beyond) these endpoints.  The problem with making (and
accepting) such generalizations is that you have to then invent some
word or phrase which describes the Christians not covered by Dave Brunson's
(or whoever's) Bible beliefs.  Try and convince the gay congregations
(there are several in this country) that they are not Bible believers,
and that they should be called ""Bible-nonbelievers"".  Good luck.  Until
you do, please do not use such phrases.

I don't think you have the right to get so upset about people who assumed
that you were posing a religious question -- at the very least, your original
posting (remember, the one with the patronizing references to Jews, and how
you would derive spiritual brownie points by hiring one) was so poorly
worded that most respondents felt you were trying to set your religious
beliefs above the law.  Now you say, though, that your claim is simply that
gays ought not be a protected class under the law.  You seem to be going
a step further, and implying that while (some classes of) disrimination are
wrong, the law should not provide any protection at all.
Neither of those propositions is inherently indefensible; indeed, many
libertarians advocate the latter as an all-encompassing general policy.
As a card-carrying liberal (I'm a member of the ACLU...), I strongly
disagree.  I'll make an equally sweeping counterclaim -- that any refusal
to hire someone based on anything other than their ability to do the job
is morally wrong, and should probably be legally wrong as well.  In practice
(and probably as a matter of principle), explicit legal protection is
extended only to those groups where there exists a proven history of
massive discrimination -- i.e., against blacks, religious minorities,
women, etc.  Given the widespread homophobia in our society, and many
explicit calls that gays should not be hired, I therefore claim that
sexual preference should be a protected class under the applicable civil
rights statutes.

If quoting random statistics and journals is to be thought of as evidence
of intelligence (or as evidence of having something reasonable to say), then
it's no wonder certain people get elected to high office.  Arndt may be
""flashy"" in that he shows people the TRAPPINGS of intelligence and reason,
but if that alone gives the impression that he really IS intelligent or that
he actually has something important to say, then perhaps he's well suited to
go into advertising (or more likely propaganda).  Don't let people like Arndt
or Brunson or Bickford snow you.  Look what the Germans got when they fell for
it.  Look what we're getting.
If they produce random quotings of ""authorities"" instead of facts, if
they can't justify their own requests for justification by others, if the
sum and total of all their logic is a ridiculous emotional appeal designed to
make you believe notions that have no logical basis in fact, then just ignore
them.  Or else point them out for what they are.

But Steve, this had nothing to do with ""what it takes to lead a moral life"".
This was an instance where I made a choice, which you rejected (for whatever
reason).  I asked you what you'd do, not whether you feel if this right
or not.  I personally detested my decision.  But I don't feel that I
""failed in this instance"".  This instance, as it were, was a business
instance, the sucess of which can be measured in dollars and cents.  I
can not be responsible for my employees sexual preference any more than
I can be responsible for the clients.  Having to choose between one and the
other, I choose the one that would benefit me, not detriment me.

No it isn't.  It is the basis of ethics: 'what would you do?' allows us to
see and to examine the petty foibles of our fellow man, and thusly to
exmaine our own.  But here in this net group we have a lot of home/hetero
sexuals all discussing the pros and cons of todays attitudes (whatever they
are) and, for the most part, in theory.  I have presented a case, and
what one person did with that case.  It is not theory, but is real.
The fact that you have never experienced a similiar situation may make
only YOUR opinion irrelevant.  I tend not to think that way, but instead
have asked: ""What would you do?"", which after commenting on it's
irrelevancy, you then continue:
> If I had been the person offering the programmer to the client, and the
> client refused because the programmer was whatever-the-offensive-group-you-
> may-have, I'd say ""screw the money and the client.""
And that is how a business closes down.  The first and foremost thing, in
my opinion, is to get your priorities in order.  Are you putting the
""so-called"" deviant beliefs of the programmer (he refuses to wear a tie
to the office, or to go out with girls :-)) ahead of both the needs and
wished of the client as well as your own.  What gave this singular 
individual with these not-so-ordinary beliefs the ability to have
""more"" rights than the client.  They both have strange attitudes, but you
side with the programmer, at your own detriment.  I side with that
which is to my benefit.  A pity, but nobody from ""that"" community has
offered to pay my rent lately.

But the gay programmer does?? Simply because he is gay I should protect his
rights at my own cost??  Give me a break.......

Golly, Steve, when did you get to judge whether this is in fact a shortcoming.
Are you stating opinion here, or is this Gospel.  And, although I'm not
particularlly proud of my decision, I still will quote from my

reply to comments from Steve Bellovin
We finally seem to be making some progress here.  First let me take
care of some small business which I hope won't start another round
of tangents.
>P.S.  Given that the premise of the argument is now apparently political
>instead of religious, I've cross-posted this to net.politics.  Future

I quote the stated purpose of net.religion:
""net.religion:	Religious, ethical, and moral implications of actions.""
By this statement the ""Gay Rights"" discussion is one of the very *few*
appropriate discussions happening in net.religion.  I am asking a moral
question.  A question of right and wrong.  I don't know how I could have
worded the question any more clearly and I don't see why I am still being
misunderstood.  A question of judgement has been proposed.  I am asking
people to comment on the ""ethical and moral implications"" of this judgement.

As far as I know my only major error so far was an early attempt at arguing
that homosexuals are invalid as a minority because they can change their
behavior.  Many people correctly jumped on that.  I don't care to defend
my ""poorly worded"" posting because that could easily get us off the subject.
Let's just drop it.  As for the last sentence, you have misunderstood
my meaning.  But that is a tangential point and you show promising signs of
addressing the important issue in the next paragraph:
>As a card-carrying liberal (I'm a member of the ACLU...), I strongly
>disagree.  I'll make an equally sweeping counterclaim -- that any refusal

>is morally wrong, and should probably be legally wrong as well.
First of all, let me congratulate you on your membership in the ACLU.  They
do a lot of good things.  Let me further congratulate you on your second 
sentence: ""any refusal to hire someone based on anything other than their
ability to do the job is *morally* wrong...""   You just said the magic words!
Now, can you explain yourself here in more depth?  Why is it *morally* wrong
to refuse to hire someone?  Please understand that I am not being obtuse.
The statement may seem perfectly obvious to you, but it is entirely alien
to me.  I can easily imagine scenarios where it *could* be morally wrong
to refuse hiring, but to make hiring a universal moral principle strikes me
as an odd proposal.  It seems to me that you must be making some assumption
about how the world works which I don't share and that you take for granted.
If you could explain your statement in more depth maybe we could find it.
A general note:  let's all be careful to stick to the issue.  We are trying
to learn about the code of morality that proponents of ""Gay Rights"" initiatives
subscribe to.

At first sight, this claim seems obviously correct, but when you look
a little deeper, you find that it is hard to determine what are the
bounds on ""ability to do the job"".  If the presence of a heavy smoker
(good at the job) impairs the ability of a co-worker to do the job,
is this grounds for at least separating the two, or perhaps to not
hire the smoker?  The overall efficiency of the company may be reduced
as compared to hiring an equally able non-smoker.  Now carry this over
to psychological (and many would say unrealistic) ill effects caused
by prejudice.  Where do you draw the line?  If someone gets very
irritated every time he sees a white person working nearby, and therefore
cannot function properly in the presence of a white co-worker, is this
reason for the firm not to hire whites?  If someone gets so turned-on
by a pretty woman that he can't work properly, is it a reason not to
hire women?  Somewhere, there is a boundary between reasonable and
ridiculous, but simple ""ability to do the job"" cannot be the place.
I don't know where I would put it, but for me it would probably be
reasonable not to hire a particuarly abrasive person for work in
a close-knit team, or a heavy smoker for work in a close environment.
But then, I don't worry about people's sexual preferences or skin
colour, but I do worry about getting upset by smoke or interpersonal
agression.

It doesn't seem at all obvious to me.  Lets cure the disease and not
the symptom.  I agree that people have been unfairly discriminated
against for whatever reason, but that doesn't give us the right to
discriminate against employers.  Why should someone have to hire someone
they don't like?  For whatever reason.  Golly, Why would you want to
go to work for someone who didn't like you?
There are generally two ways to get people to do things.  You can
force them, in which case they don't to a good job and you waste a
lot of energy policeing them, or you can make whatevery it is you
want them to do economical, and make it uneconomical for them not to.
So now the question becomes:  How do we make it uneconomical to
descriminate on the basis of sex, creed, religion, ...?  Not just
employers, but everyone.  This is a much more challenging problem.
Primarily because it already is uneconomical!  (anyone who blindly
descriminates for whatever reasons may be missing a good thing, if
they spend the time to get rid of the person while a competitor
does not then they will have a higher overhead, etc)
The problem is that it is not uneconomical enough, or at least
the social perception of it isn't there.  The problem is that the
society at large agrees with the sterotypes behind the discrimination.
To fix anything else will only obscure the real problem and make
things worse in the long run.
The law you think should ""probably"" exist does in various forms and
it is one of the reasons the original problem still exists.
Get it?

6th.  It's addressed to all voters who think they may vote for Reagan,
but especially to closet Republicans, [Ll]ibertarians, and gay people.
(The views expressed herein are my own, & not those of my employer.)
To my mind the foremost reason for not reinstating Ronnie is his
inveterate homophobia.  I wish to dissuade voters who entertain
any of the following notions:
1) Reagan is personally a Nice Guy, free of prejudice himself, but
   politically allied with conspicuous homophobes, whom he ignores
   or tries to contain;
2) Reagan's a bigot, but also a staunch defender of privacy and
   unhampered free enterprise; this, say Libertarians, makes
   civil rights laws redundant & unnecessary (& obnoxious);
3) Reagan is a nasty idiot, who can't tell an ""individual right""
   from a hole-in-the-wall, but the direction or EFFECT of his
   administration is beneficial.  No matter how dreadful specific
   Reagan policies, programs, or appointees are, a net good must
   result.
In defense of 1)-3), one could cite two actions:
-- In 1978, in his newspaper column, Reagan was the first major
   California politician to publically oppose the Briggs Initia-
   tive (which would have allowed local school boards to dismiss
   teachers ""advocating sexual lifestyle"", a phrase which was left
   undefined).  Reagan was out of office then, with no constituents
   to answer to; opposition to the Initiative didn't necessarily
   imply tolerance, but rather a desire not to undercut teachers' 
   authority & most educational and teachers' organizations had 
   already come out publically against the initiative (with an
   eye to his political future, Reagan may've wished to conciliate(?)
   California educators, whom he'd utterly alienated as governor
   by making godawful John Bircher Max Rafferty education czar).
-- It is said (this isn't more than a rather pious rumor) that Reagan
   helped to kill Roger Jepsen's bizarre Family Protection Act by in-
   action, etc.
(A third matter, Terry Dolan's giving THE ADVOCATE, a gay biweekly, 
an interview 2 years ago, for which he caught a lot of flak from 
other Reagan supporters, is in the realm of PR, a pretty shaky 
basis for a belief in Reagan's tolerance).
The truth is that appeal to antihomosexual bigotry has been a staple
of Reagan's political career from its very outset.  In 1967 he cam-
paigned for governor of California largely by obsessively charging
that the University of California at Berkeley was a ""hotbed of homo-
sexuality & communism"".  This ""queer smear"" derived entirely from a
nonviolent & rather minor campus controversy:  the editor-in-chief of
the undergraduate paper, The Daily Califorian, had published a series
of articles on homosexuals in the Bay Area.  The series was done in
an objective, social-scientific vein (the editor was a sociology major).
University regents, as timid as ever, ousted him from the editorship,
but the student senate (I think) reinstated him.  Big deal.  Apparently
Reagan thought it was, especially for his political ambitions: he won 
the election.
In 1967 no New Right existed, and the far right had virtually no power
or influence, even locally.  Reagan could not have then been the poli-
tical captive of militantly homophobic supporters.  Altho' fagbaiting
is a venerable tradition in American politics, usually employed in the
desperate final days of a losing campaign to slander opponents by innu-
endo, few politicians have made the blatant, indiscriminate, repeated,
& lengthy use of it that Ronald Reagan has.

Perhaps you can explain to me how one avoids discrimination while at the same
time making statements like ""I will fight to keep society from considering

rather, separate but unequal.

What gives any belief system (or any group of adherents to a belief
system) the right to ""denormalize""/outlaw/prohibit any set of behaviors
that doesn't interfere with or harm other human beings?  If anybody
has that ""right"" now, it's a right worth taking away.

If the prison system had the means to truly psychologically rehabilitate
rapists/murderers/ALL those who feel they have some sort of right to
interfere in other people's lives, then ""protection"" for such
rehabilitated people would be warranted, NOT to allow them to re-engage
in their anti-human activities, but rather to live their lives in peace.
What anti-human activities are homosexuals guilty of?  (By the way, I
thought ""gay"" was used not to make things more ""palatable"" for those
like you---it hasn't and it won't---but rather as a self-descriptive term
to provide a positive self-image for gay people, as opposed to the malicious
and/or more clinical terms.)

Let's also be sure to make sure that anything else that we ""just don't
like"" is also not considered by ""society"" to be ""a normal sort of thing"".

I assume the author is referring to his own vindictive arbitrary hatred.
Disgust is in the eye of the beholder.  What give such beholders the right
to impose behavior standards on beholdees?  And, if nature is ""what happens
in the real world"", how can anything that actually happens be a perversion
of nature?  Or are only one person's specific views on what is ""natural"" the
basis for guidelines?

Yes, I do.  But that is not enough.  Some religious groups oppose
dancing, Christmas trees, drinking any alcohol, etc ....  And
I assume it is their Covenant with God to choose not to do these
things, which is their Constitiutionally protected right which I,
too, will defend.  Your relationship with your deity is entirely
your own business.
However, you do not have the right to keep me from dancing, setting
up Christmas trees, or drinking alcohol, because my relationship
to my deity is entirely my business, not yours.  Religious freedom
implies religious tolerance.

No, your analogy fails here.  A rapist physically violates the
security of another human being without their consent.  Homosexual
activity is done with the consent of the parties envolved (NB: if
it isn't done with consent that's rape, too, and should be punished
accordingly).
In California, the Legislature has decided that sexual acts between
consenting adults (of unspecified gender) are not illegal.  I suspect
other states have passed similar laws.

No argument from me here.  (Homosexuals have plenty to worry about

I'm glad you will not discriminate in the workplace on this issue.
But you aren't asked to consider this sort of thing as normal.  You
aren't even asked to like it.  The only thing reasonably expected
from you is to live in harmony with others, and to be tolerant of
those who are different from you, that's all.  I'm sure you'd
want the same treatment, no?

OK, let's say it is.  Let's say that picking my nose is a disgusting
act of perversion of nature.  Whatever.  That's your choice to see it
that way.  You don't have to like that, either.  But at least allow
other people to be different from you.
If you can show me how you feel that homosexuality hurts you personally
I'd like to dicuss that, too.

discrimiation against someone on the basis of his/her skin color
or national origin.  Homosexuality is not discrimination, unless
you claim that I am discriminating against a straight woman by
not going to bed with her.  :-)

	First, I would much rather do my own thinking than have
God do my thinking for me.
	Second, if people have the freedom to do what they want,
why are you so concerned about what they do?  As long as they are
not trying to force their views upon you, they should be free to
do as they wish.  As a gay male, and as a person of color, I
don't believe that because I am gay (or Black), I have a 'right'
to certain things.  However, I do believe that as an American, I
have a 'right' to freedom of association, job opportunity, etc.
	Finally, I invite you to elaborate on the 'societal
impact' of not viewing homosexuality as a sin.
	Oh yeah, almost forgot.  I plan to vote for Reagan.

        I have to disagree with your last  statement.  There
are instances where homosexual activity has been observed in
the  animal  kingdom.   There  were  some  articles  in  net
religion  about  it  last year.  I am trying to look them up
for you.  My real point, however, is that it does happen  in
animals  as  well  as people.  If that be the case, then you
cannot call it a ""perversion of nature.""

Mr. Medin would seem to be hoist upon his own petard.
On the one hand, he rants and raves about the need for
""rationality"" and hard, scientific data on various claims
that are made about the destructive capabilities of nuclear
weapons. Yet, he seems to have no inhibitions, whatsoever,
against claiming factual status for his own, unsupported 
speculations about the factors that determine sexual orientation.
Where is the scientific data, the ""numbers""  that back  up
Mr. Medin's  assertions?  Or are we to fall  back upon  
""God's laws"" for the rationale here?

Rich, I think you're a little confused here.
I'm surprised you haven't heard about the small sect of Californians
who consider being gay to be of high religious significance.
Their fight against the normalization procedure is simply to 
preserve purity of form.  The only problem that I can see with this
is that their views become so introverted that they lose the part
of their brains' that are used for spelling and grammar.

Rich, I think you've missed the point.
The point Milo makes about convicted rapists clearly and convincingly
proves that special rehabilitation centers should be established for
gays.  That is why we have begun the Discipline Center for Correct
Thought.  Our first location will be in San Francisco.  What's more,
the term gay simply came from the creators being 'a'ltered g'u'ys;
thus 'gays'.  I'm sure Milo knew this.

Who said anything about forcing anyone to hire homosexuals?  There can't

merely requires the services of an employee.

 Even though some people aren't the most practicing members of their religious

Fine.  Now, explain to us why you feel your positions are valid, why
people's rights to have the sexuality of their own choosing, the
beliefs of their own choosing, etc., are not ""truly legitimate causes"".
(I think asking for a logical reason behind a position is the quickest
way to silence those who have nothing to say.)
As I've tried to say before, one fights for the rights of a group
oppressed for no good reason, NOT because one wants to ""liberate"" a
particular group, but rather because one wants to make sure that
groups and individuals of any kind will no longer be oppressed for
any reason.  As such, the fact that people seem to have to fight for
these things anew with each generation is the real ""slap in the face""
of the aforementioned people.
(Of course, that's why social reformers of the '60s are the YUPPIES of
today, who find it no longer appropriate to fight for the personal freedoms
of others because they've gotten theirs---along with their Cuisinarts...  )

The specific objection (as I have very *clearly* stated before)
is to legislation of a ""Civil Rights"" flavor that would protect
homosexuals in the same way that racial minorities are protected.
Even more specifically:  hiring/enrollment/membership quotas.
The concept of ""sexual preference"" as minority identification is
completely bogus and should not be afforded the same status as
*real* minority identification.
A person *is* black.  A person *is* hispanic, and so on.  A person
*is not* homosexual.  Homosexuality is an emotional/spiritual disease
which a person can be cured from.  As such, *people* should not be
*forced* to agree that those practicing homosexuality should be accorded
the same non-discriminatory treatment as members of legitimate *racial*
minorities.
If you do not agree that homosexuality is a disease then you *must*
agree that it is possible for a person to practice homosexuality
and then to renounce it (sort of like smoking cigarettes :-)).  This
is a very different thing from *being* black, hispanic, or whatever.
Again, homosexuality is *behavior*; NOT a state of being.  Employers
who find this sort of behavior objectionable should be free to treat
it as objectionable behavior.

Your characterization of homosexuals (remember! ""homosexuals""
is shorthand for ""persons who practice homosexuality"") as an
oppressed group is laughable.  What about other ""oppressed groups"":
murderers, thieves, drug addicts, atheists.  In some cases the
oppression is entirely self-imposed; in others the oppression is
directly inflicted by other people as a reaction to *objectionable
behavior*.

can be cured, and not unchangeable characteristic such as being ""black"".
That position is clearly based on religion and ignorance, and certainly is not
scientific in basis.
One of the basic ideas of sociobiology (which Dave will probably reject out
of hand as ""evolutionary"") is that behavior may be partly determined by the
genes.  Genetic regulatory mechanisms can control the balances of hormones and
other substances in our bodies, which subsequently control our behaviors.
One example, which is not yet fully understood, is schitzophrenia.  Many
schitzophrenics have a chemical imbalance that when treated by drugs,
returns them to normal behavior.  In addition, it's been established that
schitzophrenia is far more likely to occur among those with schiotzophrnics
in their families, which is strong evidence for heritability.  (And I think
that those statistics were controlled for the alternative hypothesis of
learned schitzophrenia.)
This week, I read an article describing differing responses to hormones
between men, women, and homosexuals.  (Note that these differences were in
statistical means, and do not imply any individual would display those
characteristics.)  Thus it is possible that some homosexuality is chemical in
origin, which means that it could also be genetic.  If that's so, then with
the current state of medical technology, genetic homosexuals would be as
""incurable"" as ""blacks"".
This is not inconsistant with reports of ""cures"".  For all we know,
homosexuality displays as much continuity of expression as schitzophrenia:
ranging from none apparent to severe.  This also implies that there are many
heterosexuals out there who could be as easily cured of their heterosexuality,
just as there are many normal people who could be driven to schitzophrenia.
(Apologies to homosexuals for using schitzophrenia (with its bad connotations)
as an analogy to homosexuality.)

	Yeah, I suppose it is.  Conversely, it is possible for straights
to renounce their heterosexuality (some religious nuns, priests, brothers,
etc. do this on a regular basis).  Does this renunciation of their sexual
nature make them any less heterosexual??  I don't think so.
	As for an employer's right to treat homosexuality as an
""objectionable behavior,"" it seems to me that he should only treat
this as an objectionable behavior **IF IT INTERFERES WITH THE
EMPLOYEE'S PRODUCTIVITY**!  Many straight couples have marriage
problems, and this is often considered an ""objectionable behavior""
by many groups.  Nevertheless, the employer is not involved unless
the marriage problems start affecting the work produced by the 
employee.

This is the second time I've seen this hatred thing.  Jerry Nowlin
said something similar.  I definitely hate lies and sometimes react
viscerally against them (having seen the disastrous results that 
acceptance of lies has had in my own life and the lives of some of
my friends).  As far as I know this is a virtue.  Let me know if
you can correct me on this.
As for the explanation: what I'm after is a discussion on the
limits of ""tolerance"".  We are talking about two different groups of
people:  those who say that homosexuality is a matter of ""sexual
preference"" and those to whom homosexuality is an abomination.
The problem is this:  how can we accomodate both groups in the
same country?
The ultimate goal of civil rights rhetoric has to be civil
rights legislation.  If you would include homosexuals as a minority
under current civil rights initiatives, then you would penalize
those who wish to discriminate against homosexuals.  Is this
a good thing?  Let me illustrate with a hypothetical example.
Suppose that I am an employer and that the federal government
has just outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual preference.
One of my employees comes out of the closet.  I confront him
about it and he confirms that he definitely engages in homosexual
acts and intends to continue doing so.  Being a caring, loving
person, and not wanting to see him continue in a lie unchallenged
and so confuse himself and others, I immediately fire him.  He goes
to the local Labor Relations Board (or whatever) and reports me.
A few days later a social worker comes out to the office and the
following dialogue happens:
--
""Mr. Brunson, we've just gotten a complaint that you've terminated
an employee, a Mr. Jones, without adequate reason.  Can you explain?""
""Sure, always glad to help the government!  Mr. Jones practices
homosexuality.  I found out about it and fired him!""
""Mr. Brunson, it is my duty to advise you that unless you reinstate
Mr. Jones immediately, you are subject to [lawsuits, fines, whatever].
Will you comply?""
""Not until he *repents*.""
""Ahh, I see.""  [scribbles something in a notebook and leaves]
--
Suppose I refuse to sell my home to homosexuals?  Suppose I work in
a government agency and refuse to award contracts to homosexual
businessmen?  Would you have me ""educated"" about ""tolerance"" in
counseling sessions?  That won't work.  I've already had 16 years
of that kind of ""education"" and haven't learned the lesson yet.
Here's the issue:  do you advocate federal legislation/mandates/whatever
that would recognize homosexuals as a protected minority.  Why?  What
specifically do you propose?  How will you simultaneously protect those
who obstinately refuse to accept your concept of ""tolerance""?

The destinction which was made was basically this:  homosexuals choose
there behavior, whereas blacks, women, etc, do not.
My first question is, well what about religious groups?  Jews and Moslems
can renounce their religious beliefs and practices, so does it not follow
from your argument that they, too** are not entitled to protection from

But moreover, what relevance does this distinction make?  The point is
that these various characteristics about a person [race, religion,

This is not the issue, by your own example.  What we are talking about
is essential civil rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and upheld
by the supreme court.  There are lots of people in this world whose
activities I dislike;  Nazis, Moonies, prostelytizing right-wing Chris-
tians, wife-beaters, people who rip articles out of library periodicals,
jaywalkers, creationists, trekkies and people who post to multiple
newsgroups to name a few.  It is my right to dislike them, but it is
not my right to abridge their rights as members of this society because
of that dislike.
I don't believe anyone, but you, is talking about giving gays
""protected minority"" status in the legal sense of the word.  Minority
quotas, contract obligations and so forth are *your* Phyllis Shlaflyisms
designed to conjure meaningless spectres in others minds.  A lie is
a lie not only when it is about fact, but when it is about potential.

Step one: Ask those who consider homosexuality an ""abomination"" to
to explain their position.
Step two: If, after long discussion, they have insulted, ridiculed,
and derided homosexuals, but can offer *no* meaningful explanation,
then we conclude that these are hateful, ignorant, backward people,
and that gays do, in fact, need legal protection from them.
You, Mr. Brunson, have insulted, ridiculed, and derided:

Under no circumstances could our government penalize anyone for wishing to

actually commit discriminatory acts.
The crucial point is abuse of power.  The same way you should not fire someone
for being black, Jewish, or a Democrat, if that doesn't concern the job.
Don't forget, people can be Jewish or Democrats by choice.  If you belong to
the Nth Church of Rightwing Reactionary Theology, you still shouldn't fire them,
the same way politicians shouldn't be allowed to fire Civil Service employees
of the other party, and the same way Hitler shouldn't have placed Jews,
homosexuals and other minorities into concentration camps.
Perhaps you simply enjoy feeling tyrannical.  Or perhaps you feel Christians
belong in the persecution business.  In any event, sooner or later you run into
the problem of where to draw the line at your intolerance.  Should you stop at
denying them jobs?  Liberty?  Life?  At what point do you stop ""aiding and

That is the point of civil rights legislation.  Not to be mean to bigots
(poor little dears!), but to keep bigotry from growing out of control.  Perhaps
you'd have a little more respect for those ideas if you spent some time in
Iran and were subject to some righteous bigotry yourself.

on the fact that one is a citizen (or resident, or whatever).
(In ""private"" activities, such as who ones friends are, who one shares an
apartment with, etc, a person is free to discriminate in any way they like.)
Unfortunately, that's not how things happen.  I remember well when blacks
had to sit in the back of the bus and use black restrooms (and I'll admit
that I didn't see anything wrong with it at the time).  I remember when
straight sex was limited by law (in most states) to the missionary

Since people can be pretty intolarant (sorry, I can't spell) at times,
and may be in positions to deny others basic rights, laws are needed
to guarantee those rights.  Note that I don't say ""special"" rights that
other people don't have, just the basic things that everyone should

I have three problems with this argument. (BTW, I have reasonable faith in
the truth of evolution.)  First of all, I have serious doubts about the
right of sociobiologists to make claims about behavior as complex as 
homosexuality.  The so-called science is simply to poorly developed; most
of the statements made on its behalf are essentially religion.
Be that as it may, I do admit that some behavioral disorders have chemical
and/or structural causes in the brain.  Schitzophrenia, however, is not
sufficiently like homosexuality to enable me to use it in an analogy.
Schitzophrenia is essentially a breakdown of personality itself, and is
thus fundamentally different from homosexuality or hyperactivity.
Besides, if homosexuality DOES have organic causes, shouldn't we be trying
to find a cure?  (only 1/2 :-))
Finally, there is always one cure for sexual disorders: celebacy.  
Remember that Jesus said, ""If your right hand offends you, cut it off.""
Obviously, he doesn't mean for christians to practice self-mutilation,
(if he were, I think the neck would be the place to start on most of us)
rather, he is saying to do something about one's behavioral problems,
even as far as avoidance of the situation entirely.

I must confess ignorance here.  I must say that it would do my heart
good to know that such bigots would burn in our ""secular hell"" (jail

An interesting issue arises from the fundamentalists' concentration
upon ""homosexual behavior"".  If a gay person doesn't have sex with
other gay people, can that person be ""gay""?  I would argue most
strongly ""Yes.""  When you get right down to it, ""homosexual behavior""
in the Kinsey/M&J sense is really a small part of life (for most of
us! :-)) I was ""gay"" for twelve years before I ever had sex with
another man.  Rather, a large component of gay life revolves around
life with one's SO and the friendships and acquaintanceships one forms
day-to-day.  (Just like everyone else; the fate of net.motss is to
constantly rehash the obvious.)  Indeed, though I would not prefer it
for myself, it is entirely possible to be celibate and gay.  Where do
these people stand before the fundamentalist judge (hmmn, do I mean
God or Brunson?  Brunson, of course, since it's well known that God
isn't a fundamentalist!)

and bigoted views on homosexuality.  There is another point I'd
like to make:  Even if Dave convinced me that homosexuality was
wrong, I would still consider his position reprehensible.
Deciding what is right and what is wrong is terribly difficult.
However, once a society, or an individual, decides what it will
consider wrong, I believe it's easy enough to divide those acts
considered wrong into two categories:
	Type 0 wrongness:  an act which is wrong because it hurts
	another person.
	Type 1 wrongness: an act which is wrong because it hurts
	oneself, or [for the religious] because it is unpleasing
	to God.
I believe it is the responsibility of a society to protect its
members from type 0 wrongness.  At the same time, I believe it
is the right of the individual to do what he damn well pleases
(even if he hurts himself), as long as he doesn't wrongly hurt
others.  In fact, I would go as far as to say:
	It is a type 0 wrongness to prevent someone from engaging
	in a type 1 wrongness, or to persecute or harass them for
	engaging in a type 1 wrongness.
This is a cornerstone of my personal ethics, and I think it is
a fundamental principle of our political system.  This doesn't
mean that the principle hasn't been violated -- there are laws
agaist victimless crimes, such as prostitution, in many states
-- but I still believe the principle underlies our government,
as it should.
So, Dave, even if you did convince me that homosexuality was a
""sin"", it would still be a type 1 wrongness, and thus, none of
your God damn business.  I would still consider it wrong (type
0 wrongness, the serious stuff) for you to persecute or harass
gays, to refuse to employ or sell your house to one, etc.  You
would still be dead wrong in my book (and, by my understanding
of it, in that Book you keep talking about).

so, ..."".  Neither do I believe that homosexuals should be a
""protected"" (whatever that means) minority.  If you start saying
that 10% of all jobs should go to gays/women/people of
color/whatever, you have just about guaranteed that NO MORE THAN
10% of all jobs will go to gays/women/people of color/whatever. 
	My proposition is that race, color, sexual orientation or
preference, creed, etc.  should be TOTALLY IRRELEVANT in dealing
with another person.    One should only be concerned with
another's ability.

By ignoring the latter group completely, since there is no reason why
a group who simply believes something to be ""an abomination"" has the
right to impose that view on other people who believe otherwise, and
no reason why they should be ""accommodated"".  As witnessed by their
failure to offer logical reasons (""I don't like it"" doesn't count.
Except to them.  An example of the limits of *their* tolerance.)

The ultimate goal of ""civil rights rhetoric"" is to have a world in which
NO ONE is discriminated against for arbitrary malicious reasons (which is
the only type of reason that has been offered).  The ultimate goal is
not to include any group onto a list of ""protected minorities"", but rather
to eradicate malicious discrimination by people who simply don't like
certain classes of people for whatever empty reason.  In a world in which
people continue to behave with the level of consideration for other human
beings that would make Jesus Christ spin in his grave, why shouldn't you
be penalized for your malice towards groups of people who think and behave
differently than you do?

Apparently you also haven't learned the lesson of tolerance from that
book you keep telling the rest of us to read.  All you've gotten out
of it is a springboard for showing your supposedly higher level of
morality by decreeing that all should (must) follow it.

There's no need to protect such people.  If they refuse to offer consideration
to other human beings, why show any special extra consideration to them?
It's just like your examples:  blacks have no choice but to be black, so
you can't blame them for being black (blame them???), so it's wrong to
discriminate against them; on the other hand, homosexuals (and I guess
Jews, too, eh?) choose to be what they are, so it's OK to be intolerant of
them.  By your logic, you choose to be intolerant of other people for no
good reason, thus it's OK to discriminate against you.

Dave, I think that if this was the second time (and this will be the third)
that you have seen someone call you a hatefull person you had better start
looking into yourself for the reasons why.  I hate lies too.  So much in
fact that I would rather risk putting myself into big trouble than to tell
a ""little white lie"".  You, however, go far beyond that.  I agree that to
dislike lying would be virtuous.  But to start passing laws against people
whom you think are living a lie is definitely NOT virtuous.

Two comments.  First, you totally ignore the group that believes that that
homosexuality is not a matter of choice, but of being.  Second, how can we
NOT accomodate both groups of people. Or do you want to begin treating the
homosexual people as the Jews were treated in Germany.

Good for us!  That is exactly what we need.  Strong laws to prohibit
discrimination against EVERYONE.  Even ""Kingdom sorts of guys"".  Yes, Dave,
I would even want to prohibit discrimination against someone who wants to
discriminate against others.

No, I advocate legislation that protects all people. No matter what their

Jesus said, ""If your right hand offends *YOU*, cut it off.""  Doesn't say
anything about if it offends anyone else. :-) Just a quip, but maybe a
serious one.  You still have to prove that it is a behavioural problem.  So
far, no one has.  Maybe no one will.  I kind of doubt it.  In any case, if
you can prove that it is a behavioral problem, DO IT NOW!

The first paragraph is a misunderstanding.  I did not say that sociobiology has
explained homosexuality.  I'm sorry if I what I wrote could be construed that
way.  My purpose was to show that there could be naturalistic explanations
for homosexuality, as well as theological ones, and to chide Brunson for
being so careless (benefit of the doubt :-)) as to ignore that possibility.
However, schizophrenia is not necessarily a ""breakdown"" of some ""normal""
condition.  ""Normal"" is an abstraction with no real existence.  Allow me to
present an analogy.  Many of us are familiar with behavioral game theory which
shows that there can be an equilibrium between hawks, doves, bluffers and
various other strategic behavioral classes.  Is any one of those classes
abnormal, a breakdown of another, inferior, or bad?  No.  The most you can say
about any one would be that it is a minority.  The same MAY be true of various
degrees of schizophrenia.  Anthropologists have studied schizophrenia in
numerous cultures, and have found some societal niches in which schizophrenics
perform quite well as people with much status (for example as shamans.)
The scientific attitude towards schizophrenia should be descriptive, rather
than prescriptive.  It may not be right to inflict a cure on what could be an
adaptive survival strategy, just as it may not be right to sterilize people
who don't fit some other societally determined standards.
The same is true of homosexuality.  It is neither inherently bad, nor
disadvantageous, nor a disease.  Nor should ""cures"" be inflicted without the
consent of the individual, either by laws or social pressure from bigots.","SxN3iPzy-DQJ",10,1984-09-25,-17,1

Actually, I checked up on this one... This is a synoptic passage shared by
Matthew and Mark.  In Mark 9 circa verse 35, it says ""If you hand or foot
causes you to SIN [footnote says ""lit. 'stumble'"" in my RSV], cut it off.""
In both places the context is quite plain.

Well, it's clearly behavior, so I'll have to assume you mean the problem
part.  As far as those who are not christians are concerned, for now I
make no claims at all.  For those who are, the Bible seems rather clear.
If you are a christian and think you have homosexual feelings/inclinations/

Being a Lutheran, I can't resist quoting brother Martin, in the context of
some discussion over what precise actions were or were not sinful:
   ""Sin boldly!  But believe and rejoice in Christ more boldly still!""
In a more serious vein:  Many Christians believe that there is little
difference (from a ""sin"" point of view) between performing a sinful action
and *desiring* to perform a sinful action.  Remember, of course, that I'm
pretty clearly in the ""saved by grace thru faith"" camp, so cataloging sins
seems rather unimportant to me.

Thank you for your interest in this topic!!  There isn't enough
time to respond to each comment, but I'll handle what I can.  
Anyone who wants to help out is more than welcome.
First of all, let me assure everyone that I recognize the folly
of trying to teach morality to those not interested in a covenant
relationship with the Creator.  No one can accuse me of the non-
biblical position of ""trying to convert"" anyone, and these postings
are definitely no exception.
Secondly let me point out that there is definitely an attempt
to legislate civil rights for homosexuals.  In fact, there is
a bill before congress which addresses just this issue -- HR 427.
There's probably not much chance of it getting very far.  This
time.
Many misconceptions can be cleared up by a second hypothetical
example:
Once again I am an employer.  This time there are two applicants
for one position.  A statement of requirements is on file in my
personnel department.  Requirements for the position include a
Master's degree in Computer Science/Engineering and at least
two years of experience in designing, say, CAD/CAM applications.
One of the applicants, Howard Jones, is a homosexual who exactly
fills the requirements.  The other is Susan Cohen, an observant
Jew who meets the education requrement but lacks the necessary
experience.  Some will say ""how do you know about their non-job
related backgrounds""?  Okay.  Let's say I went to school with 
Howard Jones.  When he showed up for the interview I asked him,
""hey Howard, you still a homo?""  And he said, ""Sure am, Dave.""
Susan Cohen wore a Star-of-David pin to her interview which
provoked a discussion of, among other things, her family life,
synagogues in the area where she might like to attend if she
gets the job and so forth.
Now there are two things happening here.  First of all, being
a Bible-believer, I am intensely interested in opportunities
to take advantage of the provision for goys under Abraham's
covenant -- ""I will bless them that bless you..."".  If Susan
wants the job, I will tend to favor her for it because she is
a practicing jew.  
Secondly, Howard calls himself a ""Christian"" and attends the
local Metropolitan Community Church.  This, as you all know,
is an abomination to me.
So who will I hire?  Susan Cohen, of course.  The way I look
at it, I'd have to be out of my mind to hire Howard over Susan
no matter how much experience Howard has or how immediately
he could be making money for me.
How will the state judge this?  Howard definitely had the paper
qualifications.  Susan didn't.  Howard was definitely discriminated
against because he is a homosexual.  Susan definitely received
extra consideration beyond her qualifications because she is
jewish.
Once again, when the state investigator comes knocking at my
door, I will unhesitatingly say, ""Yes, Howard had the better
qualifications.  I *discriminated* against him.""
So, some folks would have had me thrown in jail for the last
episode of discrimination.  How about this one?

This is an entirely reasonable approach.  I have no problem with

And my proposition is that race, color, *most* creeds should be
irrelevant, but not ""sexual preference"".  Discrimination against
persons because they are black or jewish or arab is an abomination, just
as granting homosexuals, adulterers, and other aberrant individuals
""rights"" is an abomination.

I am not advocating discrimination against blacks, jews, or democrats.
If I were a black, jew, or democrat, I would be outraged by this
association.  This is an example of a tactic that is frequently used
by the homosexual activist.  The public is supposed to be so conditioned
that the word ""discrimination"" triggers a Pavlovian association with Hitler,
concentration camps, persecution of Jews.  Jews should be indignant
at being placed in the same fraternal brotherhood of sufferers as
homosexuals.  Are they?  I'd be interested to know.

There is no problem with where to draw the line.  I draw it at civil rights
legislation for homosexuals.  The rest of your paranoia is unjustified.

Jail, no -- it's a civil offense, carrying civil penalties.  And yes, I do
think you should be liable under the proposed statute.  Absolutely, no
question about it -- this is exactly the kind of behavior the law is
intended to prevent.  (I should note parenthetically that your ""preference""
for a Jew, for you own religious reasons, is quite likely in violation of
existing laws against religious discrimination.  And I should also note that
as a Jew, I find your patronizing attitude *extremely* offensive.)

Any interviews in which the personal private lives of the interviewees
are discussed are unethical.  People have won lawsuits based on claims
that they were not hired because the interviewer discussed personal or
religious beliefs, et al.  An ethical job interviewer would never concern
him/herself with such matters during an interview.  The rest of your scenario
has already been discussed, pointing out your empty basis for your
discrimination and your contemptible patronizing attitude toward Jews.

And my proposition is that race, color, creeds should be irrelevant,
but not ""being named Brunson"".  Discrimination against persons based on
race or creed is an abomination, but discrimination against people named
Brunson (or those with other aberrant names) is OK.  My proposition is just
as worthy of consideration as yours:  it's equally arbitrary, equally
vacuous.  (By the way, which creeds were you leaving out?  The non-Judaeo/
Christian ones?)

This one isn't (though Arndt and Martillo might argue about my Jewishness).
(At times like this I always recall, and always forget the name of, the
clergyman who said ""First they came for... but I was not... so I didn't speak
up"".  Of course I also forget the text itself.  If someone would be so kind...)
The ""tactic"" being engaged in is YOURS:  the crux of your argument is that
YOU don't like homosexuals, thus you have a right to discriminate against
them.  The word, discrimination, when taken to its logical extreme (as it
often is when it is unchecked), *should* trigger the response you describe
for ANY group being unjustly discriminated against.

I take ""personally harmful"" to mean that YOU judge it to be harmful to
a given individual because YOU find it repugnant.  If you liked eating
chocolate, and I (and others) found that practice repugnant, and
discriminated against you for engaging in it, would that make sense?
(I know, not a good way to phrase a question directed at an Arndt clone.)

No doubt about it.  If jail is the legal punishment for discrimination you
should probably be there already.  It sounds like you want the right to decide
who and what you can discriminate against.  Why should you have that right?
Do you know better than all the rest of us?  This country is run according to
laws that are written and passed by the officials we elect.  Why don't you
send your nasty articles to your congressman and senators.  You have a right
to your opinion, and you also have the right to voice it.  They let the KKK
hold marches and pass out literature.  That doesn't make their opinions
correct either.
One issue I'd like to get some feedback on relates to this hiring scenario.
What if the actual qualifications of the 2 applicants were equal.  Would the
interviewer then have the right to use sexual preference as the basis for the
hiring decision?  What group should this be discussed in?  It has no
particularly religious overtones, but I'm not that familiar with alternate
groups.

As a former cohabitater, I guess David would probably lump me in his group of
aberrant individuals.  I'm married now, all nice and legal.  That doesn't mean
I've ""repented"".  I just made my commitment in a different way this time.  Why
can't he get it through his head that homosexuals are just expressing their
sexuality in a different way than he does.  Why should they repent?
David Brunson really amazes me.  I think he's a closet homosexual atheist out
to discredit christianity.  Nobody could really be that mixed up.

The goal of advancing minority rights is NOT to make lists of protected
minorities (""OK, discriminating against blacks, Jews, ... that's wrong because
they fought and paid their dues and are now 'legitimate minorities',  but
discriminating against gays, atheists, people named Brunson, that should be
allowed!""), but rather to ensure that unjust persecution and discrimination
against *any* group of people is agreed upon as WRONG.  It's that simple.

We are talking about homosexuals.  NOT Jews, NOT socialists, and NOT
people who eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  There are STILL
sodomy laws on the books in most civilized states (talking about the U.S.).
What we are talking about is a proposed radical shift in U.S. public
policy.  It is currently NOT illegal to discriminate against homosexuals.
Some are proposing to make discrimination against homosexuals illegal.
Currently homosexuality is illegal and discrimination against homosexuality
is legal.  HR-427 and other proposed initiatives seek to make homosexuality
legal and discrimination against homosexuality illegal.

Whoa!  Homosexuality does not constitute prima facie evidence for sodomy
nor is sodomy a practice restricted to gays.  Granted that specific forms
of sexual behavior may be against the law and that you have the right to
discriminate against those who break the law, it is incumbent upon *you*
to prove the violation.  Innocence without proof of guilt is a right that
everyone enjoys, fortunately, though it appears you would like to change
that.
(You would be amazed at the sexual practices that are against the law in
North Carolina -- as a monogamous happily married person I regularly violate
state statutes.  Fortunately only Jesse Helms is interested in prosecuting
these sorts of things.)

The title of this article represents the oft-heard rationale of those who
resist social change:  why not leave things as they are?  The corollary to
this occurs in times when social progress is growing, and the changes that
this progress causes requires some adjustment on the part of other people
who formerly didn't have bother thinking about the people their behavior
was affecting.  That corollary is:  why don't we go back to the old ways
when things were better, when everyone knew their place, etc.?
1.  What Brunson calls a warped morality is, in fact, a morality prescribing
	the right of all human beings to live as they please, provided that
	their actions do not interfere with or violate another person's rights.
	Brunson may argue that HIS right to interfere in other people's lives
	is being violated (his right to discriminate).  Yet that is clearly
	not one of the ""rights"" this very simple, minimal and rational morality
	includes.  Is there anyone who finds fault with such a morality?  Why?
2.  If a society is based on the exploitation/oppression/dehumanization/
	ignoring of an element(s) of that society, on some arbitrary basis
	(""They're not human, they're slaves.""  ""They don't believe in the
	REAL god.""  ""They do *weird* things."" ""... thus they can't vote,
	can't expect equal treatment, etc.""), then the sudden/gradual
	realization of the equalness/humanity of that element, that group
	of people, is going to cause changes in the society.  (""You mean
	we won't have slaves to work in our fields anymore?"" ""You mean *they*
	are going to working in *our* company?""  ""You mean I have to work/live
	with/near one of *them*?"", etc.)  If a tenet of the societal morality
	is truly to treat all people equally, even those who formerly were
	not, then the changes are to be expected.  A fact of life.
3.  I'd still like to see the difference between Jews/blacks/women(""legitimate""
	minorities) and homosexuals (non-""legitimate"" minorities).  I'd also
	like to know what Brunson's notion of a protected minority is.  If
	all people are to be treated equally and not discriminated against,
	why are certain groups considered ""protected""?
4.  The battle cry ""let's get things back to the way they were"", an appeal
	to those affected negatively by these changes, is most often a call
	to fascism and repression.  Getting back to the old days will of
	necessity mean getting back to (actively) repressing the newly 
	emancipated groups of people.  Such people are not satisfied until
	they can repress just about everyone other than themselves.  Then there
	are those like that clergyman who said ""First they came for the gays,
	but I was not gay, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the Jews,
	but I was not a Jew, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the
	communists, but I was not a communist, so I didn't speak up; ... then
	they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.""  (BAD
	PARAPHRASE---could someone please send me the original text and the
	name of the speaker)

Actaully, it depends somewhat on how the constitution is interpreted as
to waether or not it is legal to discriminate against anyone!  And I'm glad
to say that those few states that still have sodomy laws are having them
struck down by the courts if they won't get their own house in order.
Currently Texas is in court over the issue.

Your religion should be practiced everywhere, why do you not follow it?
Remember Jesus's ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""?  Why do you not practice
the second most important commandment, according to the benchmark of the
man you try to pattern your life after.

You are a bigot and a hypocrate.  You should not be allowed to let the effects
of the former ruin other people's lives.  You should think about the latter
and ask if Jesus wants his church run on that basis.

     Most of the articles I read in the news papers and on the net usually
refer to male homosexual behavior, but the word ""homosexual"" itself does not
mean ""male"". 
     Take for example AIDS.  Now that is a male homosexual disease, but until
recently, most of the articles didn't point that out.  People always say the
words ""faggot"" and ""queen"" when they're trying to be smart.  I'm not a faggot
or a queen, but I am a homosexual.  Get my point?
     I'm tired of being grouped in with male homosexuals when someone is talkingabout gays.  There are alot of things that go on in the male homosexual
community that lesbians don't approve of and would never practice.  This is not
to say that I don't like male homosexuals, but if I'm going to be put in a
category, I'd like to be put in the one I belong in.

        Laziness and/or unintendended ignorance, I guess; it's
much easier to deal with a group as a group than to separately
acknowledge the various sub-groups within the group.  It would be
easy (to use an analogy) to say that 'Black people do this' in
discussing certain behaviors that are practiced almost
exclusively by Black males. 
        Of course, this is not meant to condone the behavior you
describe in any way.  I am aware that the proportion of lesbian
AIDS victims to male homosexual AIDS victims is very low. 
        However, if perhaps the lesbian community were to become
more visible (both to male homosexuals and to heterosexuals),
then this tendency to lump the lesbian community in with the male
homosexual community would decrease.

   First of all, since by your own admission, you are not a straight person,
what makes you an expert on what straight people think?
   Secondly, it's not clear to me that you are right.
   Thirdly, if your observation *is* correct (let's assume it is for the 
moment), it may not be due to malice or bias against lesbians. It may just
be that in straight relationships men and women are much more similar,
by which I mean every straight relationship involves a man and a woman.
There isn't such a dicotomy in straight relationships as there is in gay
ones, where there are two distinct classes (male and female). Straights
maybe aren't used to the idea of two distinct types.

Why do some people think ""homosexual"" implies ""male""?  I can think of
two reasons.
I suspect that the word may have become specialized in the same way as
""man"", which originally referred to any human being -- and for the same
reasons.

A second possibility is that people confuse the Greek root ""homo-"" with
the Latin word.  (And are ignorant of the fact that the Latin means
""person"" rather than ""male"").

where most (many) people think of males when they think of homosexuals.
The first reason is the fact that, although there, as you say, many female
homosexuals (i.e. lesbians), they do not make themselves as visible as
males tend to.  Often, gay males are very ""flowery"", and anyone (such as
myself) who is straight doesn't have a very difficult time of determining
who is and who is not a ""fag"" (as they say).  I am not criticizing them;
to each his own.  If they want to act that way, that is their problem.
But that is not the point of this article.  
 
   Another reason for people thinking only of males when they discuss
homosexuals is the fact that females have traditionally been allowed to
be ""closer"" to each other.  People think nothing of seeing two women 
holding hands, kissing (within reason), and just generally being 
affectionate.  Therefore, people usually don't even think of women as  
being gay, because even straight women are ""allowed"" to be ""close"".
    If men were to act the way (even straight) women do, they would
definitely be subject to much criticism.  I guess many homosexual 
males do act this way (as I mentioned in the first part of this article),
which is why people do criticize them and associate homosexuality with 
them.  I guess there probably are ""normal acting"" gay males, but people
don't know about them, because they ""blend in"" with everyone else.","7FUrZMMp8bQJ",23,1984-08-29,-7,1

It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men and
women"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc.  The
linguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words as
pseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language.
Yet one can see the results of this.  Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she""
(unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean just
what the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptions
abound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners.
Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, or
else the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right?
(""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."")  This is why
many people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER,
police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid having
people assume that they refer to males.  Insisting that ""a policeman can
be a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (even
subconsciously) to mean policeMAN.  Notice that even a word like homosexual
(which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) gets
interpreted to mean ""male homosexual"".  (Thus it may not be just in
particular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions that
if no gender is specified, we're talking about males.)
Also, of course, there are other factors.  (Like assuming that the words
homosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive.  I seem to remember that a
lot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ...""
specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.)  But if you think about
it, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say a
word that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"".

I guarantee it's terminology - there is no word which means specifically male
homosexual, in the way that lesbian means female homosexual.  Therefore, most
people will assume that, if you meant women, you'd use lesbian: using the
so-called generic ""homosexual"" leads most people to conclude lesbians are not
included.   Now, if someone would like to invent a male equivalent word ....

Having been involved in a number of political groups before, the tactics
used by Mr. Arndt and Mr. Ted really come as no surprise.  Destruction of
fruitful discussion is easy if you can appear well-intentioned.  Indeed,
both may be quite well-intentioned, but our ability to carry on extended
discussion of cultural and political issues has been muddied substantially.
Under these conditions, the first task is to recognise the goals and the
problems.  The goals are simple:  To discuss cultural and political issues
of relevance to gays.  The goals do not include incessant defense of gay
lifestyles or preferences.  I have to defend my preference everyday in
everyday life.  I refuse to do that here.  Its an absolute waste of my time,
and yours.
The problems are, likewise, quite simple:  Distraction from the goals of
the group can be accomplished readily in a no-discipline environment.  We
have no moderator.  No one can intercede against one member for the overall
benefit of the group.  I.e., no one can stop Ken from flaming and no one
can stop you from responding.
		      WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?
1.  STOP DEFENDING YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS WHERE DEFENSE HAS NO EFFECT.
    You know, and I know that Ken won't change his mind.  With that in mind,
    who do you think you are helping by flaming back at him?  You aren't
    helping the overall group, certainly.  Most of us are gay.  We already know
    that gays are OK.
    The person you are helping is Ken.  He WANTS you to respond.  There are
    many possible reasons for that, but sincere interest on his part is hardly
    one of them.  
    You might be helping yourself, by getting something off your chest.
    Please, before you get something off your chest:  THINK.  Are you doing
    something constructive ... or is it destructive?  Are you destroying the
    unity of the group for your own relief?
2.  START DISCUSSING RELEVANT ISSUES.
    Here's some interesting ones:
    a.  What distinguishes gay culture on the West Coast from that on the 
	East Coast?  I bet they are pretty different.  Los Angeles is
	substantially different from San Francisco.
    b.  What has been your experience in unifying gay men and lesbians in 
	political or social groups?
 
    c.  Are gays becoming ""more right-wing""?
    d.  What are your feelings about the focus of ""gay money"" in AIDS projects.
	The ones I know about seem to spend a lot of cash on patient support,
	and little or nothing on research.  When the Reagan administration
	recently announced substantial cuts in the support of AIDS related
	research, should we be putting our money in to fill the gap?  Or not?
    e.  I liked the review of the Fourth Man.  Has anyone seen Another Country?
	Its supposed to be a pretty good film, with a gay protagonist.
 
    f.  What companies are known to have non-discrimination clauses for gays?
    g.  Surely, you have some special interests within the gay community.  What
	are they?
 
A FINAL NOTE:
Since it is impossible (and perhaps undesirable) to control disruptive 
behavior in a net group like this, we must impose self-discipline in order
to nurture fruitful discussion.  Please do your best to be a positive influence
in this conference.  Don't waste time defending yourself.  It won't help.
My next entry in the conference will discuss political motivation among gays
(or something like that).

The answer is obvious to me. In our society women are always ignored and
devalued. When people talk about soldiers, union members, professionals, or
the unemployed they're really talking about MALE soldiers, MALE union
members, MALE professionals, the MALE unemployed. If people really mean to
talk about WOMEN soldiers they always say ""women soldiers."" So it should
come as no suprise that when people talk about homosexuals they're talking
about MALE homosexuals.
Trish is totally correct in pointing out this form of oppression. Members of
the dominant group (straights, men) are not entitled to contradict, doubt,
trivialize or otherwise dismiss the perceptions and complaints of the
oppressed group.

Regarding the growing practice of using ""homosexual"" to mean only ""male
homosexuals"", I think one of the problems here is that there isn't any
word in English (that I can think of, anyway) to refer to just male
homosexuals.
""Lesbian"" quite clearly refers to just women homosexuals, so there's no
problem here.  But what do you use when you want a word for just male
gays?  ""Gay"" won't really do, because it has acquired generic meanings
too, and is often used in forms such as ""gay women"".
So I guess what we need is a new word, so female homosexuals won't
get lumped in with the male ones wholesale.

and women that I know) gays have a general idea of how straights think
because they are raised as straights.  Unfortunately, we aren't blessed
with a society whose parents might consider that their children might
not be heterosexual.  From my experience, children on this planet tend
to be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of their
own.  Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, it
makes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straights
think.
	As for straights thinking of men only when considering
homosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right.  Ask
any ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like.  The
odds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someone
who wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be a
transvestite.  Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pride
celebrations, few women are seen.  Perhaps if lesbians were more
visible to the outside world, they might become part of the stereotype

Good grief, I know people who are going to vote for REAGAN even!  But I
don't think gays are becoming more right-wing.  I think more
right-wingers(?) are becoming gay -- or admitting it.  Not too long ago,
these conservative gays probably wouldn't have even come out.  Now that
coming out has become a less strong statement against the establishment,
more conservatives feel comfortable in coming out.  And the more
conservatives (and other people) that come out, the statement will become
even less strong.
 
The conservative gays I know of aren't as far right as the people who made
the republican platform.  They view the choice between Reagan and Mondale 
as the choice between two evils.  They don't like Reagan's stands on social 
issues (eg. gay, minority, and women's rights), but they think his other

ME! I liked it a great deal. Although slow in spots (after all it is British
and they aren't so spoiled on TV), it makes a strong statement on how
much rejection (whether due to sexual preference or social class) can hurt.
It paints a convincing and disturbing picture of what people once thought of
gays.  Also, the main character is fascinating as well as having a lot of 
funny lines.  Just don't expect it to explain why this man became a 
Communist spy.  It doesn't (his being gay just isn't enough).

Just having spent a week each in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, and
having lived on the East Coast (namely Boston) all my life, I have formed a
few opinions, probably overgeneralized and unfair, but all my own, nonetheless.
For me, visiting San Francisco (NOT Berkeley or the greater Bay Area) is like
living in a gay bar, 24 hours a day.  Gay men are everywhere, and an innocent
appreciative glance is as likely to be returned here as it would be unnoticed
elsewhere.  Wonderful if you like that, but tiring to always be ""on"".  I'm sure
long-time residents are so used to this that they no longer notice it.
Also, sexuality, even in this post-AIDS era, is MUCH more open, and 
more integrated into what it means to a San Francisco Urban Gay Man.
My first evening there, my host and I were walking up Market towards Castro,
when he met an acquaintance, they exchanged pleasantries, and started talking
genteely about the ""San Francisco Jacks"".  I thought this was the a capella
schola of the Gay Men's Chorus for a while, until I made a remark to that 
effect--turns out it's a ""jack off"" club for the carefully promiscuous.
I felt a bit like a hayseed (though there's no hay in Boston.)  It's not,
of course, that there aren't such fraternal associations in New York or
Boston, it's just that they aren't discussed in such an off-hand manner.
Yet, one of the nicest, unaffected times I had there in SF was in a
country-western bar in the Folsom district called ""Rawhide.""  This is
Urban Cowboy country, not limited to SF for sure, and oriented towards
dancing: the Texas two-step (and three-step), the waltz, lindy, line dances
and square dancing.  Men danced with men, women with women, women with men.
IT DIDN'T MATTER AT ALL: people were dancing just for the enjoyment of
it.  People were matched up pretty well, too.  The virtuoso couples were
truly fantastic, but they didn't diminish the enjoyment of us beginners.
Sexuality seemed to take a back seat on the dance floor.  (Was that a
mixed metaphor?)
LA is hard to categorize, simply because it's so spread out, and I saw
so little of it.  My lover and I were staying with a couple who had met
back in Cambridge, and who were living in the Long Beach area.  Their
social life is more ""married"", and they prefer to associate with other
couples, through Dignity, the gay Catholic organization--they weren't
much into bars.  Regardless of whether I was in Disneyland or in Santa
Monica, I felt very much a member of a minority, much like a Democrat in
Orange County.  One saw other gay men, but I didn't get much of a feeling
of a community.  I'd like to ascribe this to my particular circumstances,
but I suspect the geographic isolation of communities in LA plays a part
as well.
Naturally, I've only given impressions of two West Coast cities, and
not of the areas in general.  Too, anything I say is open to be knocked down.
IS there a real difference between coasts (as opposed to individual opinions
and impressions?)

	One of the points which Dan Greening mentions in his article
""What about politics, . . ."" regards the focus of ""gay money"" in AIDS
projects.  He seems concerned that most of the gay-sponsored AIDS
projects spend *lots* of money on patient support, and that not much of
the money from gay sources is spent on research.  He seems to feel
that some of the money should be re-directed from the support functions
to the research functions.
	Although I understand his concern that we should spend more on
research and whup this monster for good, we *shouldn't* decrease
funding for the AIDS projects which support victims, their SO's and
families.   It's important to keep in mind that (in many cases) the
victim is left jobless (either because he can no longer perform
required tasks due to his illness or because he was fired for being gay
and having AIDS) and homeless.  We have to help support our own. These
support groups aren't just rap groups and counseling sessions; they are
providing *vital* services to AIDS victims.
	I'd like to hear more about this.  It's important stuff.

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much
of this article was taken.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

issues to label what he wrote ""stupid in the extreme"".

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays.

I would agree that homosexuality is not a mental illness.  Moral issues
cannot be reduced to a matter of mental health.  The way I see it homosexual
practice is largely a moral issue.  I just don't understand how the contention
that homosexuals are born--not made--is really supported by scientific data.
It is certainly not in the same category with the evidence that women or
blacks are born and not made.  Has science demonstrated that sexual preference
is in our genes?  I don't think so.  (The idea seems really weird since
the gene would have to be transmitted by heterosexual practice.) Yet from
what I have seen the Gay Rights Movement is trying to place the sexual
preference in the same boat with women's rights and racial discrimination
issues.  When they do this they go beyond claiming the right to believing
in, and practicing, homosexuality;  they claim the right to impose on others
the belief that homosexuality is right.  Not only will a dissenting opinion
not hold, it will be actively supressed (e.g. by including it in the
Affirmative Action agenda).
It seems to me that what social science has shown is that each individual
has the capacity to develop in a variety of ways concerning their sexual
preference.  I can even accept the notion that the individual makeup
of some may bias them toward developing one preferance over the other.
But demonstrating the possibility of such bias through psychology, or
whatever, does not answer the moral question of whether or not homosexual
practice is right, or whether the sexual tendencies in these
individuals are indelible (like their gender or race would be).  It seems
to me that the same sociological evidence that would give intrinsic
rights to homosexuals would also give them to those who claim to have
been born with pedophilic tendancies.  Should we honor their sexual
behaviour with consenting minors?  (This may not be far off.  There is
a group (name escapes me now) that is actively trying to influence
the sex education cirriculum in the public schools. Thier motto is,
""Sex before eight, or it's too late"". -- Not with my kid you don't.)
It seems to me that the sexual preference issue is going to get pulled
down to the young child's level along with the increasing pressure being
put on children to make decisions about sexual activity in general.  If 
sexual preference is largely a learned moral behaviour (rather than a
genetically determined condition) then kids will learn that ""anything goes""
as far as sex is concerned long before they have the capacity to deal
with, or even assess, the consequences of their decisions.
I've seen the reasoning used here that the fact that there are ""repentant""
homosexuals only goes to prove that those individuals were not natural
homosexuals.  That does'nt make sense to me.  Good scientific theorems
need to have some predictive value.  You don't get that from making post

be predicted, or even determined at the earliest stages of their development?

The APA voting on something does not make it so.  We know so little about the

Bingo.  That's absolutely correct.  And there is nothing ""wrong"" with that.
And to those born with tendencies to eat small animals alive.  (Oysters?)
Each society determines a code of behavior; each society condemns the other
societies' behavior as ""wrong"".  Currently, the definition of ""wrong"" in our
society is changing with respect to homosexuality, or at least appears to
be changing.  I have no problem with that; I have a large problem with those
people who wish to say that gay rights are inherently ""right""; that women's
liberation is inherently ""right""; that black rights are ""inherently"" right.

Not disagreeing here, possible thought that until very recently ""children""

The obvious solution to this flagrant fascistic imposition is to impose on

out there seem to be asking homosexuals to justify the fact that they are
not bad, I'd like to turn the question back to you.  What makes you think
that you can put yourself in a position of righteousness and demand of
others that they justify their preferences without you ever justifying yours.
You make an analogy between pedophilia and homosexuality.  I will answer your
question on why I think pedophilia is bad.  First of all, pedophilia is the
wrong word. pedophilia means loving children.  I don't see what could be
wrong with that if the children are willing throughout but it is very hard 
to know if they are willing or not.  When one thinks of pedophilia one is
usually thinking of rape as ""incest"" also seems to have taken on the meaning
of rape by a member of one's immediate family when actually all it means is
sexual relationship between members of the same family.  Anyway when children
are involved it is very hard to determine the degree of willingness of the
child as the adult is more powerful than the child most often (no matter what
certain authors would like people to believe).  That is why I think pedophilia
incestuous or not, is dangerous:  it leaves the door open to a lot of abuse
as the two participants are not of equal strength. (Actually an analogy between
pedophilia and heterosexuality would make much more sense, as partners in
heterosexual relationships are often of unequal strength, which leaves the
door open to a lot of abuse - and many people do go through that door)
Homosexuality is different (even though some people like to lump them 
together for shock effect).  The homosexuality being discussed here is
between consenting adults.  It is a cliche, but is the main point of it.
Why is it ""wrong"" for two consenting adults of the same sex to have 
sexual relationships?  why not?  since you are claiming that it isn't,
the onus is on you to prove that it isn't.  The position of homosexuals
on the net have been so far, that it is not right or wrong either way,
i.e they are not putting a moral judgement on the act.  So why are you?
explain yourself, tell us what you base your moral judgement on in the
first place, so that we don't get into pointless discussions.  If it is
on a certain book, then how do you know this book is right?  
(this is all net.religion stuff it seems. so what is it doing in net.motss?
yeah it seems that once again net.motss is turning into a place where
homosexuals have to defend their preferences)

But, you see, psychology will NEVER be science, and ""mental illness"" isn't
quantifiable the way the wavelength of light is.  It is not a ""thing"", it
is simply a classification of behavior, here the most broad category that
one could imagine, one that separates behavior into ""good"" and ""bad"".  
The APA wasn't operating in a vacuum when it voted to strike homosexuality
from this classification.  It was forming an opinion based on the emerging
mainstream view of sexual orientation and what constitutes mental illness.  
It is valid to ask the question: ""If an individual is well-adjusted,
emotionally mature, behaves properly, is well-integrated into his/her
environment, and this person happens to be gay, is it USEFUL to describe
that person as ""mentally ill?""  You can see how the APA answered this
question.

though there are many points which deserve a response.  But it seems to me
that this one is the crux of the matter, and the stumbling block for many
people who label themselves Christian.  I am taking up this response,
not because I feel the need to justify myself before anyone, but because
I really am trying to understand what is at the basis of what I view as
extremely irrational, unfounded behavior.
	>The way I see it homosexual practice is largely a moral issue.
I really do not understand this.  Really not.  In fact it sounds just a bit
bizarre to me.  Sort of like ""eating oysters is largely a moral issue.""
Human relations (of any sort) are grounded in the moral arena, but what is
so special about homosexual acts in and of themselves which entitles them
to being singled out for moral notice?  It seems to me that there is only
one reason for this attitude, namely, the misinterpretation of the Genesis
and Levitical texts and some of the Pauline letters adopted over the last
700 years by the Christian Church.  At least one knows where such people
are coming from: it's just a variant of ""the Bible says so, so it's true.""
Now, such people don't cotton well to being told about the subtleties of
the texts, and the contexts in which they appear, nor do they bother to
carry forth other Scriptural proscriptions against certain behaviors. I
always liked the one about it being easier for a camel to pass through an
eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  Oh--you
mean that wasn't REALLY what was being said.  You mean I need to understand
the CONTEXT of Christ's teachings.  Uh-huh.
Anyway, I want to know whether those Christians who feel, as Paul Dubuc does,
that homosexuality is a ""moral"" issue, feel that the moral argument lies
entirely upon what you perceive Scripture to be saying.  That is, because
you read the Bible as condemning such actions, homosexuality there, and
there alone, takes upon itself a moral dimension.  In that case, how do
you deal with a pluralistic, secular society which is not Bible-based?
What right do you have to enforce your conceptions of morality upon those
members of society who do not share your reading of Scripture?
And if you feel that there is more to morality and homosexuality than
simply the meagre, disputable allusions in the Bible, then by all means
state it!  I have never once heard an argument ""against"" homosexuality
that did not collapse under scrutiny, and which was not ultimately
founded upon misinformation about gay people or questionable assumptions.
As many of the readers will undoubtedly point out, this discussion is
not really necessary, since gay people will continue to exist quite happily
whether or not they receive the approbation of the Fundamentalist
religionists.  I am doing this more as a favor to them, so that they
can get their opinions stated clearly once and for all here.  It should
go without saying that this is not an invitation to inappropriate behavior
in this newsgroup, and also, the other readers should feel free to speak up
if they think that this discussion isn't worth pursuing here.  It's obviously
interesting enough to me here, right now.

First, throw out the word psychology; Webst. 7th, defines psychology as ""the
science of mind and behavior.""  Let's stick with mental illness.  It's unclear
that mental illness can never be quantified.  Epilepsy has made steady
progress from being a mis-understood, demonically orchestrated bizarreness
to being a medically treatable illness.  It seems reasonable to assume that
medical progress will continue.

I'll agree that the APA was not operating in a vacuum and may very well be the
most qualified organization to make such a determination, I think the evidence
on either side is very poor.  We know very little about how the mind works, let 
alone how it interacts with society.  Whether it's mainstream is certainly
arguable, especially as the country rides this back to the basics wavefront.

I'm not sure that's okay.  I'm also not sure it's not.  If you want to reject
all absolutes that's fine.  It's like that line about being judged by a jury
of your ""peers"".  Where are they gonna find 12 people for Chuckles Manson?
You're saying that my mental health is solely dependent on what society I 
am currently hanging out in.  And, I have to figure that someone who is gay now
passed through a *serious* period of mental illness a few years back.  I don't
like soft answers.  The only real advantage I can see to that argument is that
the stop-capital-punishment people really lose... no one is ever insane, just
not in step with society.

Of course homosexuality is a moral issue!  Once you plow through the 
AIDS problems, fight past the ""they're ruining our children"", and heave
a sigh of relief as the last ""unnatural"" proselyte is forced to view
a pair of bulls in a field...  that's all that's left, kids.  Because,
like it or not, there are a whole bunch of people out there that are 
perfectly willing to say ""That's wrong"".  Without justification of any 
kind.  (I use justification in a specific physical value sense here, folks.
Biblical justification is in a different category; admittedly, the Judeo-
Christian text is anti-homosexual.  So are a couple of other religious 
texts, if only that they don't acknowledge its existence.)  And, as soon
as someone rears up on their hind legs and says ""That's wrong."" even if
it's ""Eating oysters is wrong."", it's a moral issue.  (Besides, eating
oysters is cruel, I mean, they're *alive*, being dissolved by your stomach
acids... yeeeech!)  Quite frankly, Steve, I think you're being paid quite
a compliment here.  Your arguments are being acknowledged... the issue
is being placed on moral grounds.  I suspect that you have (at least in
contemporary American society) a much better chance of getting, ""well,
whatever they want to do is okay as long as they really want to do it""
once the AIDS myth gets debunked.

This may have already been asked...it seems like it might have been, from
the various back-references to a book by Boswell and comments made in
relation to it - but since I missed the initial articles about the book,
I will ask anyway...
What *is* the position of the homosexual community on the Scriptural
view of homosexuality?  I suppose the relevant references would be
Lev 18:22, 20:13, Deut 23:17, II Kings 23:7, I Cor 6:9, I Tim 1:10.

What Gary was (and is) saying is that such meetings deserve some special

Christianity, that's different, eh?  Again, your goal was to claim that
this was ""discrimination"", the fact that Christians were treated just like

Ah, but science leads to conclusions like evolution, and the skepticism
that leads to agnosticism or atheism (after enough examination).  These

Except when the conclusions they reach contradict the holy word of god as

They are part of what the religionists seek to abolish.  After all, how

Well, I don't believe that the Christians would take this advice.  Even they
know the value of math and science, even when they disagree with the
conclusions.  It wasn't a serious prediction for that reason.  (See below.)

I meant to type ""anti-humanist"", and what's more I think you're fully
aware of that, since it's a pretty simple typo.  But, come to think of
it, such people, when they proclaim that that word of god (as they see it)

That was light.  A light that needs to be cast on the real reasons behind

Indeed.  And Samuelson thinks faith must be right.  It is not a faith

Exactly.  And Samuelson chooses faith, not because it is demonstrably

I would think it belonged to neither.  Does Samuelson think the world

Better referred to as ""wishful thinking"", to be sure.  When you base your
judgments of the way you perceive the world to be on ""what you hope for"",
you are deliberating failing to be objective, and clouding your conclusions.
Which is OK (or not) depending on your goals.  If you're not looking for
truth or reality, it's fine.

As seen in Samuelson's summart of his own original article, the only ""fair""
hearing in his view would be one that holds Christianity up as the absolute
truth.  After all, any other ""hearing"" would show flaws in it, and he certainly
doesn't want THAT.

I said maybe.  The above was a speculation.  Yes, I defined religionist

And with good reason:  they have taught them a biased and bogus set of
beliefs contrary to real reality.  Not just *different* from ""norms"" (as
with customs of ethnic groups), contrary to reality.  Indeed, I ""revel"" (maybe
too strong a word, perhaps ""be pleased to see"") in religion dying out
from disuse.  I have repeatedly said that it is not my wish to forcefully
eradicate religion.  To do so would make us no better than they are.
To let it drop dead of its own weight as more and more people are
informed, would certainly prove better.  Of course, it is possible
that dispensing of such information through education may be seen as
an attempt at eradication by some.

""The state""?  Parents should and do have a say in what their children
are taught.  It's a shame that parents who want to teach their children
a set of beliefs regardless of their relationship to reality exercise this
right all too much, producing non-thinking children (and later adults)
as a result.

It's even less surprising that a philosophy that assumes the existence of
god in a particular form leads to conclusions about the existence of god
that match those assumptions.  But of course, Gary is not assuming, he
knows the truth about the existence of god.  I will let him do so in the
reply article that is sure not to follow because he will never respond
to a Rich Rosen article again.

I said that the methods of education described above would ""effectively
wipe out religion"".  As I've said many times before, eradicating religion
by force is not a goal nor a desire of mine, though Samuelson would like
you to think because it aids him in his perpetually manipulative style
of rhetoric and argument.

Yes, Gary, we're all heinous fascists for wanting to encourage teaching of
""thinking before believing"" ideas.  Once we've ""forcibly"" stoppoed people
from wishful thinking about gods, we'll turn our evil hands towards other
wishful thinking beliefs like ...   Only a true scholar of fascistic
manipulation would go out of his way to twist words to imply that those
who support teaching rational thinking in schools are out to forcibly
crush other ideas like the purveyors of Nazi genocide.  If your ideas
are sound, Gary, after some rigorous examination, they will hold up.  If not,
they won't.  That's the ""force"" with which ""I"" (??) will ""wipe out""
fallacious thinking.  The stronger force of all.

I am an atheist and I want to have it both ways.  Moreover, I sinsirely
believe that I am rigth.  What those two ways are?
1.  I want the principle of tolerating religion to be extended 
    to tolerating lack of religion.
2.  I want to keep certain ideas in school.
Explanation of point 1.  
   Whatever the judges explenations in the quoted cases are, the core of 
the issue is:  should it be legal to make atheists second class citizens?  
Frankly, I am not interested in the letter of constitution or ""the intention 
of the founding fathers"" but in my legal rights.  I know relativism and I 
know that one can read the constitution in diffferent ways, all of them 
honest.  Still, I prefer such an interpretation which preserves my rights.
   The precedent quoted by Paul is very serious one.  If a notary public
must believe in God, that probably means that the oath of a person who
does not believe in God is not valid.  That would pave way to other laws:
the testimony of an atheist could be regarded as less valid, also an
atheist could be legally barred from taking jobs requiring an oath.
E.g. I needed to signed an oath to accept my university contract.
   I read an intervue with sen. Jesse Helms.  He claims that while the
constitution bars establishment of a religion, it allows, and even implies
the principle of believing in God (""one nation under the God"").  Thus when
I am afraid that someone wants to make me a second class citizen, I afraid 
of polititians which at this very moment may enact laws in many states.
   The quoted legal opinion really worries me.  It seems that judges 
agreed that someone may be required to have a religion to hold a public
position,  they merely disallowed that one may be required to believe in 
God.  Happily, I do not see any polititian proposing such a funny law.
Explanation of point 2.  
   I want to keep certain ideas in school in spite of the fact that they
are deemed to by holy by a sect of ""secular humanists"".  The reason is
that I regard those as useful and practical part of education.
   Any piece of school program may become a tenet of faith for some
group.  Shall we stop teaching geography if somebody makes an idol
of a globe?  Similarly, if somebody believes religiously in evolution
it does not mean that teaching geology should be forbidden.
   What foes of ""secular humanism"" are against?  I heard and read some
of them.  They are against the idea that the norms of good and bad are
created by humans.  Their classical example of ""brainwashing in the
spirit of secular humanism"" is the following.  The teacher asks the
students to write on the blackboard different moral principles, then
invents a situations of conflict between those principles and asks
students to decide what they would do.  The conclusion is that the
school trains students in moral relativism.  
   In short, the idea which is to be purged from school by Orrin Hatch's
ammendment is: honest people may have different moral choices.  
According to fundamentalists, this is false: if you cannot figure from
the Scripture what you should do, your preacher can.  If you listen
to Phillys Schaffly, Jesse Helms, Jerry Farwell etc. then it is clear
what is the worst part of the abominable secular humanism.  
Not evolution, but the tolerance.  If there would be any activity in
the school that teaches respect to other views or other lifestyles,
you should at best remove this activity, and at least be able to
forbid your children to participate.
   The New Right is well organized, has plenty of funds and promotes
a clear, logical vision.   What is not good, is bad.  No hesitation.
Children are our future, purity of their souls is the largest asset.
Thus we should never confront our children with an idea that an atheist
or homosexual may be a worthy human being.  Remove school activities
that may suggest that!  Remove books from libraries that may suggest
that!  Remove teachers that may suggest that!  (A law on the book in
Arkansas, I guess, forbids teachers to accept homosexualism in privite
conversations with students.)

 Wrong! Thats not what secular humanism teaches. It teaches little children
 how to think about suicide. It teaches them that some people's lives are
 worth less than others. It teaches them that homosexuality and premarital
 sex are choices for them to consider. It also teaches them to ignore any
 values they may be learning in the home and that values are purely subjective
 and how to make their own values. (if any!)
 Come on! No more BS! Secular humanism is designed to eliminate God from
 our society and its central target is the YOUNG!
 And its working just fine! Because most parents don't have the slightest
 idea what is going on in the public school systems.

My suggestion is for someone to get the exact wording of the legislation,
which I believe is on the D of Educ. authorization.  I was in Washington in
1984, and the bit about secular humanism was added by Orrin Hatch to
the D of Educ.'s 1985 authorization, but was not applicable to all schools.  
In that authorization, which I know passed the Senate but don't know what
happened in conference, federal funding was being used to set up magnate
schools or some such thing.  These would be regional ""super"" schools where
bright kids would be educated on math, science, literature, etc. making them
better engineers, scientist, leaders of the future.  This was being pushed
because of data on the number of these types being educated in USSR, Japan, 
China, etc.  
Anyway, Hatch added this stuff about no money going to secular humanism type
courses in these magnate schools.  Hatch may have gotten away with more in
the 1986 authorization and extended it to all schools with federal funds, 
almost all schools now both public and private.  I wouldn't be suprised.  But
before you go bananas over the loss of evolutionary biology, etc, take a 
look at the legislation.
Write to your Congressman requesting the Do educ.'s 1985 authorization and
budget, and the 1986 draft legislation for the authorization and budget.  I 
doubt that it has been passed into law yet.  For 1986, you should request
both the House and Senate versions.  (I would do this myself, but I am leaving
the net for at least three weeks and possibly permanently.  Moving to another
network...)

Well, lookie here.  ""Secular humanism teaches little children how
to think about suicide"".  Of course, with no explaination of why
or how.  Just a bald, manipulitive, misleading, emotional, co-opting
statment that is clearly intended to make peoples' knees jerk.
Suicide clearly exists.   Who commits suicide?  Lots of people.
Of course, they're all kids corrupted by secular humanism.  They're not
people affected by overpopulation, starvation, economic hardship,
LOSS of faith, and things like that.
And then:
> worth less than others. It teaches them that homosexuality and premarital
This isn't net.abortion.  What, let us see, does the ""Moral Majority""
teach us?  Well, one thing it teaches us is that black people are
worth less than whites, at least in South Africa.  I guess that means
that the ""Moral Majority"" is secular humanism too?  Yeah, sure  :-(
> sex are choices for them to consider. It also teaches them to ignore any
""Homosexuality and premarital sex""  Of course, lump two things,
clearly unrelated, together for the emotional kick it provides.
The first ""homosexuality"" is supposed to cause a knee-jerk 
fear reaction.  Of course, since Dan lumps them together, the second
""Premarital Sex"" must be the same.  Well, Dan, one of the points
of secular humanism is that different people have different
opinions, and that's all there is to it.  You seem to say that
I HAVE to hold your opinion.  Hell, you presume that I hold your
opinions. I don't.
> values they may be learning in the home and that values are purely subjective
> and how to make their own values. (if any!)
Sure, and since that's what you hear, that's what they teach.  Never
mind that they point out that many ""Christian"" ethics are necessary
for the functioning of society and the self-interest of the 
individual.  Never mind that secular humanism tries to establish
a NON-deistic ethos that provides each person a place.
(And that justifies being nice to others, etc, in a completely
non-superstitious way)
You don't.  You don't have any place for a 'secular humanist""
and you make that clear.  You consider, from the tone of your
article, ""secular humanists"" to be worth less than others.
Does that make YOU a secular humanist?  Or do you just have
the same ethos you're accusing them of?

I have a good idea.  You're trying to prevent my children from

cosmology (among other things) and replace them with a
set of supernatural beliefs.

I think this merits a translation from the opinions of a fanatical Christian
into words approaching a more objective version of what secular humanism is
and what people like Boskovich say about it that it is not.
If it teaches them to think about suicide, about why people might feel
like committing suicide in this world (rather than covering up or ignoring
the fact), great!  If it teaches them to make their own choices about sex
based on positive real information and not edicts, great!  If it teaches
them that some people's lives are worth less than others, it's probably
a religious institution we're talking about and not a school teaching
the dreaded secular humanism (note how such religious schooling did and
still does teach about the inferiority of, not only non-Christian groups,
but even other Christian groups in many cases).  If it teaches them to
think for themselves and not blindly accept the values of their parents
and clergy, given them the faculties and tools to do so, GREAT!!!!!!!!
I can only hope for more of this in the future.
> Come on! No more BS! Secular humanism is designed to eliminate God from

Thank God for that!  :-)  This is the raving of a paranoid desperately
believing in some plot to ""eliminate god"".  If god is ""eliminated"" from
people's thoughts because they are taught a little bit of reasoning
ability to help them reach new conclusions, what are you going to do
about it?  Call teaching of such things ""secular humanism"" and try to
ban it?  That's exactly what you are doing with your vile disgusting lies
designed to smear the teaching to children of how to think for themselves
independent of you and your precious so-called values.
> And its working just fine! Because most parents don't have the slightest

Especially you, Mr. Boskovich.  It is most apparent that you are making
up stories about what ""the teaching of secular humanism in our schools""
is all about, to further your own sick ends.  Hopefully some day your
children may be able to write a set of essays about objective proof for
something (as you did) in which they actually provide objective proof,
having learned what it means and how to acquire it.  Why do you want to
stop this from happening?  Because you value your values more than the
good of your own children?

Anybody who would trust the word of Phyllis Schafly, a woman whose writing
uses as much substantiatory material as yours, Dan, I would question.
Dan, if you are such a ""good Christian"", why do feel the need to make up
lies about the ""evil secular humanism"" in order to preserve your values
at the expense of teaching your children about reasoning, science, and
independent thought?  Are you a Communist?  It sounds like a Communist plot
to squelch the minds of our children and make them willing slaves when
the Commies take over?  I don't believe this, of course, but reassure me
please:  are the fundamentalist Christians really Communists out to destroy
the foundation of American thinking?

I don't wish to get into the issue of premarital sex except to mention
that there it is not currently a method for some people to engage in
marriage under this American legal system, same sex couples for example.
HOWEVER, homosexuality is not a choice to consider, because it is a given.
That is to say that there are homosexuals, and those of us who are such
did not necessarily ""choose"" to be so.  It is true that some of us chose to
happily engage in homosexual activities rather than remaining in unhappy
little closets called acting hetro or remaining celibate.  And all schools
should teach that for homosexual children, there definately is that option.

Them's strong words, Dan, and I expect you to document them or say that you
are wrong.  By document I mean show me where in a ""secular humanist""
document that is identifiable as such the above are proffered.  I do not
mean in a book *about* ""secular humanism"" by some yo-ho like Phyllis
Shafley or Jimmy Swaggart.  I mean in a manifesto *by* so-called ""secular
humanists"" identifying themselves as such.  I suspect you will find these
charges are harder to prove than the popularists would tell you.

I can't imagine what you're talking about, what secular humanism
""teaches"" regarding suicide.  But I do know that I have yet to meet
anybody, religious or not, who hasn't at one time or another considered
suicide.  Why shouldn't we recognize that most Americans face thoughts
of suicide, and teach them what it *really* is - a permanent escape, not
only from the real but temporary pain they may be feeling at the time,
but also from the richness and joy that life has to offer them as they
travel through various experiences?  And teach them that *before* they
get into that pain, 'cause once they're desperate enough to consider
suicide, it's too little too late.

Huh? Who's lives are worth less than who's [whom's?]? How does it teach that?

You mean they aren't choices?  All those people I know (including myself)
who have chosen one or the other or both have done the impossible?  Gosh.
Or are you saying that they *are* choices, but that the lives of homo-
sexuals and people who choose to have premarital sex are worth less than
other people's lives?

It teaches them to make their own values?!  You mean it teaches them to
think for themselves, to evaluate options and make informed choices for
themselves?!  Gasp!  What is this country coming to when we have people
who think for themselves and don't just follow blindly when someone tells
them ""this is The Truth""?  It's a far cry from Nazi Germany that we have
here, and I for one am appalled.  You're right, we better get The Truth
indoctrinated early...just in case it can't stand up under close
scrutinization.

You should have control over what they learn, this is exactly why I'm against
Planned Parenthood counseling.  I find it ironic that people are more against
puplic institutions teaching religion than against private institutions secretlycounseling kids on sex and secretely giving out birth control pills, and secret-ly performing abortions.  As you said, ""after all they ARE my kids.""

I think you'll find that the systematic exclusion of religious values
(and even religious practices) from the public schools to be fairly recent.
One thing that has always been considered part of the ""minimum necessary""
for the survival in society and society itself are certain standards of
moral conduct.  Are these unrelated to religious values?
As I see it, the problem with the public school's exclusion of religion
stems not from the fact that religious practice (e.g. public prayer
and religious services) and doctrine are excluded or not taught.  I'll
agree that the public schools are no place for this.  On the other hand,
the schools are *public*, tax supported, and compulsory.  When something
that is being taught in the public schools contradicts certain values
held by those who must send their children to these schools and support
them, those people ought to be allowed to have a say in what's going on.
Who decides what is the minimum necessary content of an education?  Is
the teaching of evolutionary theory absolutely necessary?  I think not.
One can teach biology, chemistry, and physics (the understanding of
how things work) quite apart from any speculations about their ultimate
origins.  These can be reserved for future studies in the school of
the students own choosing.
There are areas of conflict in what the public schools teach and what
many people believe.  As I see it these conflicts are most pronounced
in the areas of personal morality (e.g. the moral content of some sex
education programs and ""values clarification"") and origins (have we
evolved or were we created).  In these areas, I would think that there
should be a minimum of exposure to the various points of view.  Some
have said that this will only confuse students.  Maybe it will.  I
don't think we can say for certain, however, that it would be wrong.  Many
things in life are confusing.  With such things I think it is better to
be a little confused than to be decieved or infused with bias.  Confusion,
if it really is part of the subject, should not be avoided by giving neat
answers consonant with only one view.  By the time students are old enough
to grapple with the subjects themselves, they ought to also be exposed to
some of the diversity of opinion that exists in society on those issues.
To argue that some points of view ought to be excluded to avoid confusion
seems silly in principle.  I think this is clearer when we apply that
same principle to other areas.  Could we justify not teaching that some
countries don't value democracy or an open economy to avoid confusion?
What about differing views on war and peace?  Should students be exposed
to only one view of the Vietnam War to avoid confusion?  There is probably
a place for avoiding too much confusion, but we ought not to use it as
a pretext for giving one point of view a monopoly in public education.
To do so helps insure that students will close their minds to further
inquiry or persue such inquiry along a predetermined path.
If the public schools are public, then the public ought to have some
say where there are real points of conflict.  (Dredging up imagined or
remote ones along with them, as some have done, does little but muddy the
waters).  One solution, might be to cut back on the control the state
has over education and remove some of the financial and administrative
barriers to private education in competition with public.  This solution
seems to have some merit, but I haven't thought out all the implications
very thoroughly.  (Maybe someone else can expand on the possibilities).
Too much control in this area opens the door to tyranny equally well whether
the controlers are religious or secular.
>Religion is NOT necessary to survive 
>in our society.  I've survived quite nicely without, thank you.
You have survived in a society that is full of religion and which is
infused with many religious values.  It's part of the air you breathe.
Why do we routinely go to great expense and inconvenience to save
individual human lives?  Why must hundreds of people pull their cars
to the side of the road to let emergency vehicles through?  I think
it's greatly due to the fact that traditional religious values have
placed great value on the worth of the individual.  There are a lot
of things we take for granted that have religious roots.  Many hospitals
and major universities (consider Harvard and Yale; read their original
charters) were founded by the church.  Our present emphasis on education,
and advances in medicine has definite religious roots.
If you personally get along fine without religion, good for you.  But
your own perception can't be extended to say that society itself (in
which you've survived quite nicely) gets along fine without it.  That
would be a fatuous claim indeed.  One which many seem to take for granted,
however, in justifying the exclusion of certain values from public domain
(e.g. the public schools and government).

>			Scott J. Berry
If certain information is barred from the education process, the extent of
which it can be said that any subsequent choice is informed is questionable.
Teaching the ability to gather and analyze *all knowledge* is hindered when
knowledge from certain sources and points of view are systematically
excluded.  For the most part I agree with this paragraph, however.  But
I'm wondering how your sentiments apply to the cumpulsory exclusion of
religious values from public space.

I would object to that.  Parents should not have full control over education
of their children.  I would not like you to forbid your child to learn
arithmetic.  I presume that Planned Parenthood doesnot councel how to make
69, but advises on the most fundamental question of biology.
Of course, kids should be smart enough to buy whatever supplies they need
in a drugstore.  But that requires some information.  Many of the people
raise their children in such a way that they are ashamed to ask for
condoms in a drugstore (even as adults).
Teaching about sex and providing services for planning parenthood is not
propagating promiscuism.  It merely faces the problem.  I think that it 
may be much easier for parents to explain aspects of sexuality to children, 
when they may assume that the children know the basic facts.  You may explain 
to your daughter why it is not good to engage in sex, even if she may do it.  
But if you just say that kissing is a sin, do not expect that she will heed
your advise.

And if parents would teach their kids about sex and birth control, instead
of having such outrageous puritan hangups about such topics, there wouldn't 
be a need for them to go to Planned Parenthood to learn.
If you're so worried about your children having knowledge, YOU censor them.
Let ME worry about MINE.  People are more concerned about public institutions
(i.e. schools) because they're mandatory.  Planned Parenthood is a resource,
not a requirement.

One of the stong points of our society is that there is as much homogeneity
as there is now.  I'm not in favor of reducing it by segregating children
into idiologically pure institutions.  There's a great deal of value to be
learned by exposure to the variety within our culture: that is one of the
important homogenizing factors, that which makes us a melting pot.
The number of ""objectionable"" things taught in public schools is extremely
small.  There are already two established routes for those with objections:
private schools, and ""sunday"" schools.  My RC parish provided free schooling
on saturdays in RC beliefs for those students who didn't pay to go to their
regular school.
Finally, I view public standards for schools (including private schools)
as an important check on the power of parents in favor of the rights of
their children.  Frankly, I consider some of the indoctrination and
practices at some private schools as illegitimate as sexually abusing
your own children.  For this reason, I'm not enthusiastic about encouraging
private schooling.  I'd much rather see tools for enforcement of quality
in public education (such as successful suits against school districts
that provide poor education overall, just as suits have been successful
for segregation.)

Does humanism teach little children to think about suicide?  I always thought
they learned that from television.
Does humanism teach people that premarital sex is a choice to consider?  I 
thought it was nature.

Children are people and not robots.  Their individuality and their minds must
be respected, not programmed.  Parents can try to ""shelter"" children all they
want, but in the end the young adult will make ones own decisions.  I
personally would want my children exposed to all philosophies, since in life 
they will encounter all philophies.  I would like them to know something
about several religions - why hide the fact that some people are religious
and that the various religions have different practices?  You can't hide
reality from people forever.  Now actually, the child of an anti-abortion
activist will probably learn about abortion much earlier than a child of
a pro-choice family.  I have heard so much discussion at home and after
church in my friends' fundamentalist home that their children must
*certainly* have some curiosity....  now in a pro-choice home the
discussion may never come up at all in front of four year olds, even
though it's always on the radio and TV - or do you make sure that the news
never reaches the ear of your children?  So parents can act like little
dictators and oppose Pravda while using it's techniques on sons and
daughters...
If a parents' moral and religious values are very strong, then they
should be able to withstand the presence of conflicting values.
Trying to shelter and suppress a child will only lead the child to
rebel and seek out all the information later.
Now with Planned Parenthood, this organization has *never* to my
knowledge recommended or advocated sexuality, but it does allow
the teenager to come into contact with medical information.  If
the parent creates a climate of empathy and discussion, then the
child can confide in the parents and there will be no need for
""secret"" counseling.  
Remember, unless you intend to raise your child under house arrest,
there is nothing you can do to physically stop your child from
having pre-marital sex.  So instead of being arbitrary and negative,
it is best to communicate with the teenager, and to voice, most
of all, that the son or daughter not get involved with someone
who doesn't treat him/her right.  The concern should be that
your son or daughter is not hurt or used.  
Again, parents can attempt to program their kids' minds, in which
the offspring may very well end up in the local mental institution
(or sleeping on Telegraph Avenue) or parents let the children learn
to cope with and deal with reality as it is.","Ya5JKxekTQAJ",1,1985-09-12,-3,1

Is it better to indoctrinate children according to some mythical, public
standard?  Believe it or not, parents have a right to determine what type
of education is best for their children.  Numerous state and federal courts
have upheld that right (including the Supreme Court).  Indoctrination is
the very reason why we chose to remove our son from public school and are
now educating him at home.  We didn't like the way he was being
indocrinated in the public school.  It's not just a matter of what
materials are being used in the classrooms.  It involves the whole ""I don't
care"" attitude of the public school mentality.  Mediocrity is only a symptom
of a much deeper problem.  The problem is the egalitarian mindset of public
educators.  Equality is an excuse for laziness.  If a teacher has thirty
students in his or her classroom, the easiest way to get through the day is
to assume they are all on the same academic, social, and physical level, rather
than trying to treat each child as an individual. They don't understand that 
each child is special and unique in some way.  In public schools we have the
worst form of segregation; academic segregation.  Put the fast learners
with other fast learners so they can relate.  Group the slower children
together so they can all limp along at their own pace, never being
challenged to become better, just survivors.  They're almost treated as if 
they were born that way and there is nothing the poor teacher can do about it.
""Let's just make do with what we have and get through the school year.""  That 
seems to be the moto of most school systems.  (I hope those caring teachers 
will forgive me for my sweeping generalizations.)
I don't want that for my children.  It want them to be challenged with the
idea that they can do anything.  They're not some number; some name on an
attendance sheet.  They are unique persons and my wife and I will do all that we
can to insure they get the very best education available.  For us it means
providing the education ourselves.  ""Homeschooling: it's not just a job, it's
an adventure!""

Sorry, Frank, kids are their *own* selves, not ``yours.''  The fact
that a kid has gotten herself pregnant shows that ``you'' aren't in
control.  So you're going to force her to carry the pregnancy to term,
huh?  Quite a tyrant, aren't you!  Thank God for Planned Parenthood!  
And you're also going to ``control what they learn'' in this open
society of ours.  *Good luck*!  I suppose that *public libraries*
are on your list of ``private institutions secretly counseling''?  
(Oh, that's right, *public libraries* are public!  Worse yet!)  
(Sorry if this seems a bit inFLAMEtory, but it gets my gander up
when people talk about restricting the free flow of information!)

Thelemites here) to Crowley's defense, but it's appreciated.  I posted
Crowley's ""The Message of the Master Therion"" as sent to me by Josh Gordon,
when I was sending the New Age mailing list digests to net.religion a few
months ago (before fundamentalist flak convinced me that it was a bad idea).
This explained ""Will"" in fairly clear terms.  Now I'll post part two of my
""Introduction to Thelema"", still in production, which deals explicitly with
""Will"" as a basis for a moral system.  Or, as Bruce Smith would say, ""Would
you like some Thelemic literature?  Would you like to buy a flower?""
Thelemic Morality
=================
The fundamental tenet of Thelema is that the supreme moral principle is
""Do what thou wilt.""  First, look at what this is not.  Governments and
monotheistic religions adopt a uniform approach to morality, that of a list
of taboos.  Although the Mosaic Law is rather different in content from the
U.S. Penal Code, it is identical in approach.  A subset of all possible
actions is set down in writing and forbidden.  The worthlessness of this
approach should be clear: no such list can exhaust the possibilities of
immorality, and any attempt to make it do so creates an impenetrable
document.  The common man will never be able to do more than scratch its
surface; only a few scholars or lawyers will be able to apprehend its
entirety.  Thus the list of taboos forms no real moral guide.  It is to
virtually everyone just an ambiguous source of possible punishment, an
unknowable and impersonal force demanding fear and respect.
On the surface of it, ""Do what thou wilt"" is just as bad, or worse.  It
would seem to mean that one should do whatever one pleases, without regard
for morality.  However, the Book says more than ""There is no law beyond
Do what thou wilt.""  Allow me to quote briefly:
""The Word of Sin is Restriction....  thou hast no right but to do thy will.
Do that, and no other shall say nay.  For pure will, unassuaged of purpose,
delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.""
Clearly this ""will"" is rather different from the animal will, or that which
is normally called ""force of will"" or ""will-power"".  It is a divine, a
transcendent, Will which is referred to.  All ""Sin"", all ""wrong"", is but
the Restriction of that divine Will.  The relation to Taoistic concepts in
the latter sentence is apparent.
So now consider a society in which all keep to ""Do what thou wilt"".  None
imposes an obstacle to the Will of another; each seeks to know and do
her or his own Will to the fullest.  No one is content to sit all day,
rotting the mind with passive stimuli, kissing ass at work and squelching
any individual thoughts that may arise by mischance.  (We have all seen the
ostracism that afflicts those who dare disagree with their neighbors, and
would never dare incur that or abstain from its infliction, would we?  Such
is the cry of the middle classes.)  No one lives by deceiving others or
by violating their will to own property; no one kills, rapes, or commits
other crimes which restrict the Will of another.  In short, the
completeness of morality, both all aspiration to Godhead and all worthwhile
taboo, is expressed in that one phrase, ""Do what thou wilt"".
Of course, such a society will never exist, but morality is inherently
quixotic.  (Why will it never exist?  Because institutions devoted to the
lists of taboos exist, and under ""Do what thou wilt"" it would be immoral to
destroy them by force, provided they do not directly attack our freedoms.)
Society can never reach perfection; interpersonal morality consists largely
of determining what that impossible perfection would be like, and conforming
one's own behavior to it as much as possible.
There is a real psychological difference between the Law of ""Do what thou
wilt"", and the list of taboos.  To verify this, try to explain ""Do what thou
wilt"" to a fundamentalist Christian, an Orthodox Jew, or some other who is
emotionally or dogmatically attached to one of the lists of taboos.  The
person will prove simply incapable of understanding non-taboo-based morality
in most cases.  The difference is what Crowley liked to call the
Sin-Complex.  The taboo-monger cries ""Not my will but thine be done!""  He
sees himself as a cringing worm, bereft of all virtue and capable of good
only when under the control (or at the least guidance) of some force outside
himself.  This attitude is useful to religious and political leaders, and
thus its predominance.  Who understands and follows the Law knows that,
though subject to a myriad ignoble attractions and repulsions, she or he
contains the divine spark that redeems all the rest, awaiting only the Work
to bring it to light.  The psychological benefits of realizing that one's
core is good, not evil, are immense; in fact, there is a school of
psychoanalysis, the Rogerian, which deals with nothing else.
Thelema is the foe of all sexism.  The third verse of the first chapter (a
rather prominent position!) is ""Every man and every woman is a star"", thus
explicitly denying all sexist ideas.  Furthermore, the cosmological model
involves the uniting of the goddess Nuit with the god Hadit to form the
hermaphroditic Ra-Hoor-Khuit, rather than a male god spurting out the
Universe in an act of masturbatory genesis, or a female goddess who
parthenogenetically birthed all life.  The Universe is the dynamic union of
male and female, not the creation of either alone.  Numerous parallels from
Hinduism and Buddhism will no doubt occur to the East-inclined reader.
The only ""evil"" is not direct restriction of the Will.  The release from
restriction can create an unbalanced response which is not in conformity
with the Will.  Rather than returning to the Will, one may swing to the
opposite extreme from the former restriction.  For instance, a slave who
seeks to enslave his or her former masters rather than seek equality for
all, or a person who reacts against religion dominated by a single gender by
forming a religion dominated by the other gender rather than a sexually
egalitarian religion, or someone who reacts against hypocritical standards
of ""good"" by identifying himself with ""evil"".  These are extreme cases; the
unbalance involved in reaction against Restriction can be far more subtle.
One predominant feature of morality is the carrot and stick aspect.  Why
should you follow an inconvenient moral code?  In the list of taboos
approach, the answer is simple: you will be punished if you transgress, and
rewarded if you keep to the straight and narrow.  The Hindu idea of karma
and its variants such as the Law of Three are similar.  There is no
""official"" Thelemic position.  It seems evident that seeking to know and do
the Will will lead to a less painful and restricted life.  Crowley himself
believed in karma in the literal reincarnatory sense; I don't believe in the
afterlife, but I do feel that acts of deceit and such carry their own
psychological penalty which is immediate and self-inflicted.  I don't mean
guilt, which fails to effect many people; I mean paranoia in its overt and
subtle manifestations.  Most people are insufficiently introspective to see
that their enjoyment of life is dwindling when they increase their use of
deceit, but the negative effects are no less real for that.  The crooked
businessman, the liar, the thief, the murderer: all are always on the run,
always looking over their shoulder to see who's either trying to do to them
what they have done to others or found out about their misdeeds.  The
attitude of these people is always that the world is ""dog eat dog""; they can
never reach any real contentment or rest.
Recently, an attempt has been made to improve upon ""Do what thou wilt"" by
prepending ""An it harm none"".  I ask that anyone devoted to this formula
realize that I am only speaking what seems to me the truth, the result of
sincere analysis.  I formerly accepted this formulation, but came to see
that it was seriously flawed.
The ""Wiccan Rede"", as the modified version of the Law is usually called,
misses the point of ""Do what thou wilt"" from both the negative and positive
perspectives.  Negatively, the Law is non-interference, not non-harm.  The
will to harm is valid in unusual cases.  For instance, an Allied soldier in
the Second World War should not be called ""immoral"" for removing Axis
soldiers from incarnation: the Nazis were deliberately engaged in an
enterprise whose goal was to thwart the wills of all Jews, and any others
who disagreed with the Nazi party line.  Yet under the Rede that Allied
soldier could not have pulled his trigger, because it is harming someone to
injure or kill him.  It is no use to object that under the Rede the Nazi
would be likewise restrained, because such situations do arise in the real
world and must be dealt with.  Under the Law it is clear: the Nazi is not
acting in accord with his will because he acts to block the wills of others,
and therefore it is not a violation of his divine will to force him to stop
this interference.
Certainly causing harm is something any sane person seeks to avoid whenever
possible, and most obstacles can be gone around instead of destroyed.  But
to elevate non-harm to a primary position in one's morality is to ignore the
reality, that harming is not only justifiable but necessary in some cases.
At the turn of the century, many occultists and theosophists staggered under
the burdens of the right wing, such as anti-Semitism and fascism; as the
next century approaches, many occultists and witches stagger under the
burdens of the left, such as pacifism.  Both must be transcended.
It is also possible to interfere with another's Will without doing any
""harm"" as far as the person interfering is aware.  To pick another extremely
clear-cut example, Soviet psychiatrists honestly believe that to oppose the
state is a mental illness.  They are thus, as far as they know, not harming
someone by removing such opposition.  All ""harm"" short of the infliction of
physical injury is a subjective judgment, so the actions of the brainwashers
are in accord with the Rede.  Under the Law, however, no such fallacy is
possible:  that this is interference with the person is an undeniable,
objective fact.  A closer-to-home example of ""harmless"" interference, and of
how it is permitted by the Rede, is provided by the president of Covenant of
the Goddess who told me she would like to see violent sports made illegal.
Of course, it is possible to define harm in terms of interference, but then
why not just use the original version?  Still, I can't see anything wrong
with the Rede under that interpretation, except that it is still only the
negative, the forbidding, half of morality.
The positive perspective on the Law is that one is to learn and do the
divine Will.  This is wholly lacking in the modified version.  The Rede can
be paraphrased as ""Do whatever you feel like so long as it doesn't hurt
anyone.""  The mere human will is the only thing mentioned: at least, I have
never seen any Wiccan commentator take the Rede in any other light.  Where
is the aspiration in this?  Where is the moral obligation to realize one's
fullest potential?  Morality is not simply to refrain from evil, but to do
good; but you would never know that from the Rede.
I have spent so much time on this because pacifism is a serious fallacy, a
Restriction of the Will of the same order as a taboo against premarital sex.
In fact, if one examines the beliefs of the leading original exponents of
pacifism in this century, such as Gandhi, their sexual priggishness is
obvious.  This is not a coincidence.  Remember always that to strike is as
blessed as to stroke, provided only that it is the true Will to do so.

Ray, it's about time you STARTED thinking, and presenting facts.  I have yet

any to offer?  I think dispensing data about making sex safe and describing

Ahem!
It seems I am going to have to clarify my position on/definition
of porn. (Look out netters, Ellen's going to talk like a
castrating bitch again...)
I find it harmful to me when ""Playboy"" presents a view of women
which, while lacking the physical whips and chains, is severely
limited in scope.  I don't like the image of women in ""Playboy""
any more than that of women in ""Screw"";  the ""Playboy"" women, gazing
wetly at the camera in soft focus, seem to me to be the reason
behind men's rationalization of ""You know you really want it.""
How can any man NOT get that impression when all the images he is
exposed to have that message?  ""Playboy""'s misogynism, while far
subtler than that of ""Hustler"", is nonetheless far more widespread
and is accepted by most of liberal America as all right.  This I
find upsetting, because it presents a subtler and more
insidious encouragement of violence against women: the violence
of date rape or forced seduction.  With ""Playboy""'s message that
all women want sex all the time goes the idea that it is all
right to give it to her.  When a woman DOES NOT want sex, a man
who reads ""Playboy"" regularly and intensively will probably get
angry and confused and accuse her of being a tease.
While images like the infamous ""Penthouse"" spread of last
Thanksgiving which featured an Asian woman trussed up like a
turkey fill me with outrage and fury, the ""Playboy"" images make
me internally nervous.  I don't want to be mis-seen as a
""Playboy"" nymphomaniac any more than I want to be mis-seen as a
willing victim of sadomasochistic violence.  It seems to me that
the attitude that ""Violence is uncool, but 'Playboy' isn't
violence and is therefore justifiable entertainment"" misses a
great deal of the subtlety behind this form of pornography.
Last year a woman was raped at Reed, and the subsequent Reed
rape discussion group included a lot of men who indicated that
they felt that it was necessary to strongly encourage (read that
as you will) their dates to sleep with them because they really
did want to give in but needed to feel that they were being
overcome by a stronger force and therefore were not ""at fault.""
At Reed, and in most places in this day and age (I hope), that's
patently ridiculous.  
At the risk of getting off track, I want to quote a (male)
friend: ""If she says 'no,' you should stop.  She'll let you know
if she didn't mean it before you get to the door.""
Pornography never presents an image of a woman saying 'no' and
meaning it.  Thus the idea that women never do mean 'no' is
encouraged.
Hope this clears up my position.

I don't think you talked like a ""castrating bitch"" at all. I do
have a lot of reservations about what you did say, however, and I
hope no one minds if I break up your article into little pieces to
vioce them.

I'm sure men have used this rationalization for thousands of years,
while ""Playboy"" has only existed for 30. So I very much doubt it.

Well, for one, by being mature enough to realize that what the

Maybe that's because the misogynism is in the eye of the beholder in this case.

I'm sorry that it upsets you, but I think you're being upset by a bogey.
For me, its encouragement of violence against women is so subtle
and insidious as to be non-existent. I can't believe I'm so unusual
in that respect.

So it is, if she wants it, right?

Oh come now. You must think men are awfully simple-minded. 
And anyway, we can get confused enough without reading ""Playboy"".

Well, I'm glad that ""Playboy"" only makes you nervous and not furious.
However, it seems to me that a common reaction to someone saying
""I can't see such-and-such"" is ""well, it's just too subtle for you"".
Maybe so. But this argument can also hide a host of prejudices and
misunderstandings. It would seem to me safer, and more effective, to
concentrate on correcting the obvious before worrying about the subtle.

Now, it sure looks as if it's *ideas* that she's objecting to.  To
be fair, I don't recall Ellen explicitly saying that she wants the
government to step on Playboy magazine, but since she said these in
an article about censorship, it's a strong likelihood.

I must admit that I don't read '""Playboy"" regularly' but I've read a
few over the years and I must say that I have *never* received this

I believe that this is a view that has been around far longer than
Playboy.  I think that *some* men have probably subscribed to this

You are certainly entitled to this as *your* definition of pornography
but, as has been said many times before, you are, in no way, entitled
to insist that that definition be applied to *me* or to *anyone else*.

Are we really going to go through the whole pornography/censorship
debate again, with people saying that we must eliminate all
pornography.  And others saying they are against any form of
censorship.  And others saying they are not suggesting censorship but
that all pornography must be forbidden...
I take my constitutionally guaranteed rights *very* serioulsly; *all*
of them.
Lets quit worrying about the symptoms and see if we can cure the disease.

newsgroup last year, and I didn't put in my $.02 worth then.
After all I'm just another male who reads net.women and 
who is opposed to censorship, believes consenting adults
can do whatever they please, and so forth.  
     After reading Ellen Eades' recent postings I'd like 
to point out something that hasn't been mentioned here.
That is, how the preoccupation with censorship that has
arisen in the women's rights movement in the last few
years has influenced the public's view of feminism.  It
has influenced my view, and fairly negatively, and here's 
why.
     I'm a liberal person, and I have always viewed 
feminism as a liberal cause, which I have always supported
except for the radical fringe.  Censorship of pornography
is pretty much a right-wing, moral-majority type
of thing.  True, there have long been feminist writers
that wrote of the evils of pornography.  But until
faily recently it seemed to be thought of more as a
symptom of society's prejudices, rather than a problem
in itself that should be attacked, and the discussion
against it was pretty much intellectual.  It's one
thing to object to pornography, quite another to
advocate banning it.
     Ellen feels offended by all forms of pornography,
including fairly mild examples such as Playboy.  This
is her right.  This attitude seems to be more prevalent
these days than in the past.  What Ellen and many others
are really objecting to is the explicit portrayal of
women as being sexually available, presumably to men.
What Ellen may not realize is that she objects to people
whose sexual preferences are different from her own.
She realizes that there are people who are sexually 
entertained by something she finds offensive and disgusting,
and this upsets her.  The mentality here is the same as
that of people who object to homosexuals, on the basis
that homosexuality is inherently disgusting.  This is
narrow mindedness, pure and simple.  
     It's probably part of human nature that any given
individual is unlikely to accept, at a personal level,
all forms of sexual expression.  But it takes a heluva
lot of nerve to claim that your preferred form of sexuality
should be protected by law, and somebody else's should be 
banned.
     I believe that this sexual intolerance is the real
motivation behind the pro-censorship movement.  The
other justifications -- linkage to criminal violence,
association with illegal activities such as child
pornography, and so on -- are pretty much rationalizations.
     So my advice, to those who are considering jumping
on the anti-pornography bandwagon, is to think twice
about what you are doing.  By attacking one of society's
basic freedoms you are helping to discredit the entire
women's rights movement.  And the movement is not doing as
well as it was a few years ago.  I am not alone in my
opinions, so I think this is something to consider.

 [ and several more paragraphs that reinforce the same idea ]
Ellen, I agree with your comments that the image presented in Playboy
is ridiculously unrealistic, and I think I can see your real concern
that men will believe it.  But not all men do, any more than they believe
what they see on television or in films.
An important question is: given that Playboy's sort of pornography is
misleading, what should be done to correct the problem?  Should we ban it,
or should we try to educate people?  And if banning it is the correct
solution, should we not also immediately ban most TV commercials on the
same grounds?  Or maybe most TV programs too.
Should I not ask that all John Wayne movies be permanently
banned, on the grounds that they present an unrealistic and even dangerous
image of what a man should be like?  Aren't Clint Eastwood movies even better
candidates for banning?
I agree that there is a problem.  I don't think that censorship is the
answer in this case.  Do you?  If so, how is this case different from
the other examples I mention?","fwIgOdBNqDoJ",19,1985-09-07,-19,1

It is a shame, but the ""public"" can be very easily manipulated
to believe almost anything.  The ""media"" (another strange entity)
seems to have made up its mind recently to prematurely bury
feminism by defamation and assertions that it has passed away.
Anyone who really wants to learn something about a certain
school of thought should really not rely on reader's digest
condensations of it but should instead go directly to the sources,
i.e in this case, feminist writings.  Having read a lot of feminist
material myself, I have found basically that there is not one
single issue on which all feminists agree (or did I miss it?).
I have seen all sorts of very good feminist analyses exploring all
kinds of important issues reaching very different conclusions.  This
does not mean that feminism is a philosophy that cannot make up its
mind, but simply that it is a philosophy that acknowledges the
complexity of life.
Anyway the reason for this preamble was to point out that there is not
ONE feminist position on censorship of pornography.  Of all the
issues I have seen discussed in feminist forums, censorship is probably
*the* issue where there is the most disagreement, and rightly so,
because it is such a thorny one.  Therefore, even though Andrea Dworkin
would really like to do so, she does *not* speak for all feminists.

While I cannot agree with some frothing at the mouth that I have
seen coming from some anti-pornographers (?), I think that it is
too easy to dismiss the idea of censorship of pornography as you
did by calling it a ""right-wing, moral majority type of thing"".
A responsible society should be able to censor itself when not
doing so endangers the life of some of its members.  Pornography
does pause a real threat to women, and the solution to this threat
might just include some amount of censorship.

And I think the above is a cheap shot.  Who are you to decide
exactly what is in Ellen's mind?  It is one thing to object
to things one might consider disgusting even though it poses
no threat to oneself (such as homosexuality). It is another
to object to things that one considers pauses a personal threat.
I object to pornography for this reason.  It scares the hell out
of me to know that some person might read some of that crap and
decide to act out his fantasies on me against my will.  That
has NOTHING to do with what other people do in the privacy of their
own bedroom, it has to do with MY safety.

Oh give us a break!  we all know that.  Nobody's objecting to

And I believe that your article is pretty much a rationalisation
to support the fact that you have a lifetime suscription to
Playboy, Penthouse and all sorts of other magazines showing little
children and women being cut up into little pieces while enjoying 
it all, and YOU enjoy it all and you don't want anybody to spoil
your fun.  So there!
See, anybody can psychoanalyse anybody else if they want to and
dismiss their arguments without listening to them.  You are not
immune to it.  So if you don't want to be subject to this kind of
abuse why don't you practice what you preach and be a little
more tolerant of those you dismiss as intoleranty simply because
you don't want to bother listening to what they are saying.

Gee, and I thought the right to physical safety was one of our

be balanced out against others in some cases, eh? (<- I'm from Canada)

Of course you are not alone in your opinion.  It certainly is
not an original one as I've pointed out above.  Ah, yes, how much
you care about the ""movement""..  reminds me of Ken Arndt and how
much he ""cares"" about homosexuals.  With friends like that.....

I agree.
I believe that Ellen Eades etc. are improperly concluding that porn dehumanizes
and degrades women.  They seem to be concluding that because a man sees
some pictures of some women being sexy, the man will assume that all women
all of the time will want sex with him.  I think concluding that is wrong.
I think that readers of pornography (normal stuff like Playboy/girl) 
>fantasize<, not ""think"" that some women some time will want sex with him.
I think most people know the difference between pictures and the actual
things pictured; they build a >fantasy< partner in their mind, >based< on the
sexual characteristics of the person in the picture.
Besides, magazines such as Playboy, in their interview questions and
biographies give info (such as hobbies, favourite literature, career
and school goals, favourite foods, moral and social values)
which have nothing to do with sex at all, and imply that the women
being pictured are real human people.  (BTW, they also talk about husbands,
boyfriends, children, etc. implying that the real people behind the
photographs are not only real humans, but unavailable :-)
(and on a tangent...)
Ellen Eades etc. seem to equate
""being >photographed< to satisfy others' sexual desires"" with
""being thought of as >existing< >only< for sexual desires"".
The purpose of pornography is to satisfy sexual interest.
It would be nifty if it were possible to photograph ""a sex"" without, in
the process, photographing women (or men, children, animals, or whatever).
However, sex implies/requires (pictures of) women.  This does not mean
the inverse (women imply sex), which certain people are wrongly concluding.
If someone saw a knitting magazine (for example) which pictured women knitting
things, should they then conclude that all women knit, and that women only
exist for knitting?  (I hope not :-)  But Ellen Eades seems to be
claiming that readers of Playboy are stupid enough to make a similar
conclusion.
That is where I think Ellen Eades is wrong.
> > Pornography never presents an image of a woman saying 'no' and

If it did present such an image, it would be defeating the purpose!
The above conclusion does not follow.  And anyway, if that kind of
thinking were applied to other realms, we would have to ban all
fiction (and any communications dealing with only one aspect of a topic)
because someone reading it might make horrible overgeneralizations.

A responsible society should be able to censor itself? 
As for pornography posing a real threat to women, I don't
buy it.  Rather, it is society's prudish, moralizing attitudes
towards sex that pose a threat to women.  
    As others on this net have pointed out, violence against
women is highest in countries (such as the Soviet Union)
with the strictest censorship.  Countries such as Sweden with
little or no censorship have the lowest rates
of violence againstr women.  If viewing pornography might
cause a marginally stable individual to go out and commit 
a sex crime (and this hasn't been demonstrated) it is probably
tracable to his moralistic upbringing and conflicts related
thereto.  But arguing these issues was not the point of 
my posting.

Clearly you don't regard reading pornography as a valid
form of entertainment, as oppposed to whatever it is 
you do for sexual pleasure.  You feel that pornography
is a personal threat.  I'm sure Jerry Falwell feels that
he is personally threatened by the mere existence of
homosexuals, and that their existence is degrading to 
all men.  I stand by my analogy, I think it is a good one
and explains a lot about the attitudes of people like you.

It's designed to entertain horny men, nothing more.

Maybe that explains something.  Lousy as the public school

I don't know of the reference to Ken Arndt.  
    The point of my posting, really, was to say, ""Nobody's
raised the issue on the net yet that this right-wing
pro-censorship stuff is eroding feminism's liberal
base of support.""  
    I believe Sophie is underscoring this point for me.
She probably wouldn't write off an otherwise loyal
feminist just because they were against censorship,
but because I'm male, and tried to dig a little deeper
into the background of the pro-censorship movement,
she writes me off instantly.  Wonderful.

	Haven't you skipped the step where you show that pornography endangers

	Sorry, but you don't get the right to outlaw something just because it
scares you; you have to demonstrate the danger. The distinction you make
between your fear of pornography and someone else's fear of homosexuals is no
doubt clear to you, but it isn't to me. Don't you think homophobes consider
gays a threat to society and their families? Many of them will say things
like, ""I don't care what they do to each other in their bedrooms, but don't
let 'em near my kids!"" There is a considerable body of mythology about the
threat to children presented by gays, and homophobes are as anxious to
convince us that gays are a ""real threat"", as you are to convince us of the
threat of pornography. But, what is your evidence?

	Proscription of things not known to be harmful is an intolerant act.
Whether or not Mr. Pope is right in his conclusions about the motives of those
who want to ban porn, he has reason to be suspicious. There is no more
evidence of porn causing attacks on women or children than there is of
homosexuality being harmful to society. If it's not the evidence that has
convinced the anti-porn lobbies of the evil of porn, we have every right to
suspect some hidden agenda.

A man is such a simple machine.  If you put pornography in one end and turn
the crank a little, rape will come out the other end.
Pornography is not like yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater.  In the latter
case, there is a direct cause and effect relationship between speech and
people getting hurt, so that type of speech must be restricted.  That is, it is
obviously nearly impossible that this behavior would not lead to people rushing
out of the theater in a panic.  In the former case, all you can say is that
someone *might* read some pornography and then try out some of his fantasies
on you.  I say that if a man rapes, he has made a concious decision to do so
(barring mental illness), and that the pornography is neither necessary nor
sufficient to produce the effect.
which *might* lead to rape or other forms of violence.

If anyone has any solid evidence that the availability of pornography is
related to violence against women (or men, for that matter), please show
it. The last several times this argument has come up, the only evidence
has been anecdotal or descriptions of poorly designed studies which only
prove conclusively that teenage boys are willing to say that they would
like to commit rape. On the other hand, I've heard several times that
when restrictions on porn are relaxed the rates of most sex crimes goes
down, and no one has contradicted these claims. If anyone has any real
evidence linking porn with violence, please show it to us.

Excuse me, but even if a very strong statistical, as opposed
to causal, link between pornography and violence existed, you still 
would have no kick coming.
There are laws against people raping you, attacking you, detaining
you.  or even threatening you.  These laws are just and worthwhile.
There are NO laws against people fantasizing about doing these things,
no laws against deciding to do them, but there are laws against doing
them.  Why?  Because it only harms you when these things are done, not
when they are considered.
Eliminating pornography because there might be (my understanding is that
it is hardly beyond argument) a statistical link between porn and violence
ignores the point: violence is already illegal.  If you could show that
some people react involuntarily with violence when confronted with porn, you
could perhaps legitimately make it a crime to show THOSE people pornographic
things.
As it is, I don't know of any such identifiable class of people, and the
violence you fear is already against the law.  To object that making
porn illegal would result in fewer rapes per year is silly.  Segregating
men and women might accomplish the same objective, as might castrating
all men.  The fact is that our society is free enough to recognize 
(most times) that it is the CRIME that is the thing to be made illegal,
not the circumstances which MIGHT lead to crime.

That's EXACTLY right.  The danger of censorship  (which carries with
it the rationale that the state may PREVENT certain non-violent,
non-intrusive behavior because non-identifiable folks MIGHT react in
dangerous ways) must be balanced against an unproven implicit claim:
that you would be safer in a society where pornographers operate
outside the law.  (Remember, making pornography illegal merely makes
it illegal -- it doesn't stop it).","Kw28L9IIJKQJ",20,1985-09-24,-29,1

Two reasons why I am against ALL censorship:
1. In the 1950s, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita was not allowed into
   the U.S.A. for some time because it was considered ""pornographic.""
   Many people believe today that Lolita is one of the masterpieces of
   post-WW2 literature (myself included). James Joyce's Ulysses, also
   an influential and many say important piece of art, was similarly 
   banned (there was a famous court trial over Ulysses, as I recall).
2. I grew up in the Corn Belt, and our next-door neighbor was a farm
   woman from Minnesota. One day she called my mother and complained
   that the local high school had her son reading pornography. My
   mother asked her what she meant, and the neighbor said he had been
   assigned a book to read that dealt with extramarital sex and
   illegitimacy as its major themes. She wanted my mother to join her
   in a 'crusade' to rid the high school of such filth and thereby
   preserve the minds of our youth. The book was, of course, Hawthorne's
   The Scarlet Letter.
Who is to say what is pornography and what is not? Like it or not, we
live in a pluralistic society. I will NOT tolerate anyone: fundamentalist 
Christian, black activist, feminist, Republican, Democrat, telling me 
what I can or cannot read. First, the obvious targets go: hard porn
that most would agree has no redeeming social value. Then, someone
will claim that books like Ulysses and Lolita are pornography, since
""filth"" like this obviously can't be art. Unless you live under a rock
you surely realize that there's a hell of a lot of people out there
who won't want to stop once the adult book stores are closed down.
I find the agenda of radical feminists like Dworkin as threatening to
my freedom as the agenda of certain radical fundamentalists of the
right. Stay OUT of my bedroom and keep your hands OFF my bookshelf!

The point I was making (clearly I thought) was that there is not ONE
feminist position on censorship of pornography.  What I've noticed
from reading feminist litterature is that this issue is creating a
split in the feminist community.  The next point I was making is that
""the media"" has been ignoring the voices of anti-censorship feminists.
(I did say both of these things.  I don't know how much clearer I can
make my point).  Therefore, all I was trying to say is that you shouldn't
rely on the popular media to get a deep understanding on feminist ideas,
just like you shouldn't rely on the popular media to get an understanding
of what hackers are.  If you believe that media, all of us hackers are
criminals and feminists are all pro-censorship.

Yes, and it doesn't and that is very unfortunate because we do not have
a responsible society.  Whether the *state* should enforce censorship is
another issue.  The point I was trying to make (awkwardly - my fault)
is that some rights have to be weighed out against others, and I do not
find it inconceivable that in a ""perfect"" society, pornography would not
exist because people would realise that its benefits are not worth the pain
that it creates.  How we achieve such a society, I don't know.

It wasn't the point of my posting either.  The reason I posted was that I
was incensed by the atmosphere of insensitivity that surrounds this whole
issue.  I do not believe in censorship either, but I cannot respect people
who will refuse to acknowledge the negative feelings that some pronography
causes some people.  All pornography is not equal, some of it is harmless
and even stupid, some of it is fun, but there is also some of it which is
very depressing.  All I would like is for anti-censorship people to say:
""yes we realise that pornography hurts, but we really don't think that
censorship is going to solve the problem"" instead of ""if pornography hurts
you, it's because you are sexually repressed and you simply want to impose
your prudishness on other people"".  All I would like is some more compassion,
and I don't see much of it (except from Sherry, who of course was attacked
for it).

I don't care about whether pornography is a valid form of entertainment
or not.  (Actually, I have bought some pornography (gay) and got some good
giggles out of it, so I guess it was entertaining).  But yes, I do feel
threatened by some pornography, and some of it makes me very depressed.

Well some people see it as ""hate litterature"" and that's why they want it
banned, not because they don't agree with the form of sexual expression.
You see, you are doing it again: you are refusing to listen to other people's
opinions on pornography.  Some pornography is obviously hateful of women.  Why
are you refusing to admit this?  Admitting this does not entail that you have
to be pro-censorship.

Yeah, but do they explain why?  Is this ""respect"" based on actual caring for
the welfare of society and its members or is it just one of those wonderful
slogans that makes one feel proud to be free to be proud to live in the
greatest (and freeest and proudest) country in the world?

I think this is a very good point.  I just wish you hadn't surrounded it
with all the other garbage and personnal attacks against pro-censorship
feminists.  Yes, I worry about this too, but as I explained a few times
I see this more as an outside misrepresentation of feminism than anything
else because I really don't see feminist being united in this issue at all.
One would hope that people who care about these issues would care enough
to distrust the media's portrayal of (anything in general, but more
particularly) the feminist community's opinion on the matter.  That is
probably very wishful thinking however.

(well, actually, I think you did a pretty good job of underscoring it
for yourself.  <-:)

I hope not, I'd have to write myself off.  Until very recently, I was very
annoyed by this issue and refused to have a position on it because a/ I believe
that there were more important feminist topics to worry about and b/ I didn't
like any of the arguments I had heard from either the feminist pro-censorship
side or the liberal anti-censorship side (and of course not the right-wing-
protect-our-women's-purity side either).  However, I have recently been exposed
to some feminist anti-censorship positions which do not attempt to excuse
pornography, and do not dismiss the problem and pain as imaginary, but who
simply and reasonnably adress the issue of whether censorship is an appropriate
reaction to this problem (and come out concluding that it isn't).  I am 
convinced.
>but because I'm male, and tried to dig a little deeper
>into the background of the pro-censorship movement,
>she writes me off instantly.  Wonderful.
I don't think you dug deep enough.  All you did was slander, and that's what
I objected to.  My opinion is that a pro-censorship attitude is a very
understandable reaction to the feeling of threat that pornography causes,
but that one must move beyond that position and realise that censorship would
create more problems than it would solve, because it would almost certainly
be used against the exact people it was supposedly meant to protect.
Actually some men have already said this on the net.  I didn't object.

Well, then you seem to *freely* believe what the media has told you. 
Feminists are divided on this issue: even though Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon are pro-censorship, Robin Morgan, Erica Jong, and
Carol Vance (the ones I can remember for sure) are against it.  An organisation
called FACT ( Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force ) fought the Minneapolis
ordinance.  Many feminists (or at least those who express themselves by
writing) have had the opportunity to see the effect of censorship laws
on themselves and are thus very aware of the dangers of such laws.  For
a good collection of articles on the matter, I recommend the book ""Women
against Censorship"" edited by Varda Burstein.  You might be interested in
the april 1985 issue of Ms ""Is one woman's sexuality another woman's
pornography"" and the September 1978 issue of Ms: ""How to run the
pornographers out of town and preserve the first amendment"" by Robin Morgan.

You have not given your own definition of pornography. What exact depictions
do you hold to be a threat: kiddie porn (already illegal as child abuse and
rape)? Sado-Masochism, imposed (in which case it becomes assault, battery,
rape...) or consensual? Homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual intercourse?
How do all these pose a threst and cause pain?

If ""some of it"" is ""fun"" or ""stupid"" or ""harmless,"" how come [all of] 
""pornography hurts?"" 
The context of this discussion is the desirability of banning pornography.
I have strenuously pointed out that pornography must first be legally
defined. Then its negative effect on the social order must be demonstrated.
Only then can a discussion of the putative benefits of a ban begin. 
The above paragraph asks the net to agree that porn is bad and implies that
those who will not do so are just insensitive clods. Come on now, you
know better than that.
Someone on the net wrote to the effect that her goal concerning pornography
is to make it less ""socially acceptable."" That is a pefectly valid way of
expressing oneself. If you feel that pornography hurts you, take whatever
action is necessary: attend town, county or borough government meetings where
zoning laws, building permits, retailer's licenses and the like are debated
or issued. State your objections. Lobby your elected representatives. In other
words, follow the path to political change provided by a democracy. However,
if your position is not enacted, do not complain of a male conspiracy, and
do not demand compassion for a cause that has been democratically lost. If
you or organizations representing you are unwilling to do the necessary
legwork, why are you complaining?

Yes you stated these points clearly.  My own (limited by your 
standards) exposure to feminist writing on pornography hasn't
given me the impression that there is much PUBLISHED by
feminists who take the position that censorship is a far worse
evil than pornography.  Perhaps such views are expressed in
private forums.  If so it's time to give them more press.

I happen to not believe that pornography hurts.  I allow that there
is a small fraction of society who feels harmed by it.  
My compassion extends to most such people, but I find some of
the pro-censorship attitudes repulsive, whatever their cause.

I'll retract the statement in question since it does come off as
a personal attack.  I maintain however that my analogy between
homophobes and pro-censors does APPEAR to explain certain 
pro-censor attitudes.
    And damn right I feel threatened.  I see the pendulum
swinging further and further to the right.  I don't like it,
and, and after a brief and polite interval of initial patience,
I'm not likely to have much compassion for anyone defending the
actions of the extreme right-wing.

I suggest that if you delinieated what you find ""obviously
hateful"" about some pornography, I would find that 99 percent
of what you describe results from your personal objection to depiction
of certain sexual practices.  This assumes your objections
are along the lines of those of Gloria Steinham, Susan
Griffin and others.

I tend to think that I am entitled to my opinions even if I have
no knowledge of whether the opposition is a vocal one percent of
self-described feminists or the entire population of the country.
     Seriously, perhaps I am not totally familiar with the various
feminist positions on pornography.  Perhaps you, Sophie, are
not totally familiar with the history and practice of censorship
in the U.S.  Feminist writings you no doubt
would never advocate censoring would indeed be censored if the
situation reverted to that of the early twentieth century.
Why help turn back the clock?  ANY form of censorship requires
empowering someone to decide what should be banned.  Nobody
should be given that power.

I'm not sure how normal people reading pornography poses a threat to
women.  Rapists tend to be abnormal and with or without pornography,
they will vent sexual frustrations in abnormal ways.  The only threat
I see at the moment is the male who attempts to coerce his partner
into fulfilling pornographic fantasies.  Normally, this would be
a problem for married or cohabitating couples.
Perhaps the real issue, rather than the availibilty and content of
pornography, is the rights of a woman.  In Colorado the successful
conviction of a husband for raping his wife was big news.  Should
a husband be able to force his wife to fulfill fantisies picked up
from pornography?  Should a wife have the right to fulfilment of
her fantisies?  Shouldn't both be aware of each others preferrences
BEFORE they get married?
Sexual preferrences (for men, I don't know about women) seem to be formed
at a very early age, usually around 2 or 3 when the child is out of
diapers and can stimulate themselves.  At that point, anything may be
considered pornography.  By age 5, the sexual preferrences are fairly
well refined.  Even a sears catalog (ladies or mens wear) can be
erotica to a person deprived of all other sources.  Fetishists,
transvestites, and dominants/submissives frequently start this way.
They are also less likely to discuss their preferrences because of
the repression which caused these peculiar tastes in the first place.

There are feminists who actually maintain the superiority of women and
promote female domination of men in porn publications run by women.
In fact, the arguments of such authors is quite convincing.  Of course,
the objective of most feminists is equal opportunity isn't it?  Can
you outlaw female submissives without outlawing female dominants?
opinions are not those of CCI and are subject to change.

Seems to me this argument can cut both ways.  My SO could just as well lose
out  on  a  job  because they're a WASP and the company has a quota to meet
with a limited number of job openings.
AA doesn't live in a vacuum either.

My wife just graduated from law school, and is looking for work after
being denied a position at a law firm where she worked over the summer.
Because she's not working yet, we're still living in a small apartment
and indeed cannot afford the home of our choice.  Our childrearing plans
are also uncertain.  Whether she did not get a job offer because
of her sex we will never know, but neither my wife nor I would even

*ANY* way the hiring practices of a prospective employer.
The implication from the above posting is that we'd support AA if we

I've already voiced my thoughts several times on this issue-- I
think the problem should be vigorously attacked on an educational
basis.
I have no quarrel with AA, but rather with the implementation currently
in wide use, which focuses a lot on the workplace.  I feel that when
this approach is logically extended, some form of quota system is
unavoidable.  How else are you to measure progress?
I am not even against quotas or goals per se: for example, I would
be much more receptive to the idea that every school in an area
(eventually the entire country) would have to reach a certain
level of competency as demonstrated by test scores (granted, not a
terrific yardstick, but perhaps the best we have at this point?).
Schools doing considerably better than the norm would be studied so
that their methods could be applied at schools doing less well, and
perhaps even teachers could be moved around-- trying to ensure that
all schools give their students an equal education.
This still avoids perhaps the most important part of the problem-- 
individual attitudes.  How these are to be changed (alas-- I can't
agree to brainwashing the whole population) I am really not sure--
it will have to be a grass roots sort of change-- since the change
involves the attitudes of individuals, individuals are going to
have to stand up and fight for their beliefs.
That's about it.

I agree it is unfair that teachers and nurses make less money than plumbers
and truck drivers, but I don't agree that the problem is inherently sexist in
nature.  It is simply a matter of demand and supply.  If we should really 
implement a ""comparable worth"" payscale based on level of skill and training
required, than all Bachelors, and all Masters and PhDs who could find a job
in his/her field should earn the same amount of money.  That implys that 
chemist and biologist in their respective research labs should get a pay raise,
or computer scientist and electrical engineers take a pay cut (no way! :-))
Furthermore, by artificially maintaining a fixed pay scale that doesn't
reflect supply and demand (assuming there is a fair way of doing so), the
victims (women or people who choose to major in low paying fields) will see 
no need to get (previously) higher paying jobs.  The result would be more
job segregation and more pressure on the woman NOT to enter traditionally
male job, which, aside from higher pay, usually has more power.
If the environment is free of artificial barriers (like discrimination, peer
pressure, or social attitude), then people should gravitate toward the best
paying, most interesting/rewarding/powerful job he/she is qualified for.
Today's wage descrepency on male/female is not that the JOBs are not fairly
paid, but that some groups are pushed into the job that is not the highest
paying, most intersting ... for that person's worth.  To remedy that problem
by inflating the job's worth and not the person's self-worth/qualification
is not a good solution.  (I am not saying that teachers and nurses has lower
self worth or qualification than truck driver, but if the teacher and nurse
want to be PAID as much as the truck driver, than BE one!  Hence, the remedy
we should work on is to strike down those BARRIERS that prevent the potential
teacher and nurse to make the choice to be a higher paying truck driver.)

A better question might be ""why aren't feminists raising more hell over
the way boys are brought up to be qualified and interested in, 
only ""men's work""?  
Paul, you tell mothers and fathers across this nation how to raise 
their children, and see what kind of response you get.   
You can't legislate the way people raise their children--you can't
even make suggestions to some parents without risking having your
teeth pulled out of your head and pushed into your eyesockets. 
It's been my experience that people raise their girls to be ""sugar
and spice"" for three reasons.  The least thoughtful ones do it because
they think that that's the way it should be.  The more thoughtful
ones know that women are discriminated against in ""men's jobs"" and
don't want their girls to be disappointed by trying for one.  By
eliminating discrimination, citizens feel more free to raise their
daughters to take on a man's work.  During the oil crisis, I knew
several women in college whos parents were strongly encouraging 
them to go into geology, petroleum engineering and land management
(lot of good that does now, during the oil glut).  I honestly 
don't think that these parents would have encouraged their daughters
to major in such ""dirty, dangerous"" topics had there been no anti-
discrimatory or affirmative action laws passed.  People raise their
children to be successful.  If employers make it so the only way
a woman is going to ""make it"" is by starving in a bad job or marrying,
then people will raise their daughters to marry, and to have ""something
to fall back on if the marriage fails.""  Oh, and the third reason 
people raise their daughters to be ""sugar and spice"" is that it's 
easier--you don't have to help her with her math homework, or drive
her to little league practice, and what's more, you get extra help
around the house!  How nice!  And she'll stay at or near home,
maybe even go to that nice community college down the block!  Help
keep the extended family together after the boys are grown and 
gone away!  Me, I'd rather have my teeth pulled out of my head and
pushed into my eyesockets.  
I agree that equality should start at home.  But the home is the first
place of training for the outside world.  And if the outside world dictates
inequality, then parents will raise their kids to be successful in an 
unjust world.  The only way to get parents to raise their daughters
to be successful in ""man's jobs"" is to make it clear to those parents
that their daughters won't be denied those jobs on the basis of sex
once they're out of college (an increasingly costly investment in any
child).  
Paul, for these reasons, I believe that your suggestion that feminists
go around telling other people how to raise their children would be 
ineffective and counterproductive.  What if they all agreed only to
find that their daughters were chronically unemployed because of discriminatory
hiring practices?  Or that the companies involved created special 
jobs for women with advanced techical & scientific training, so as to
get the work out of them while paying less?  (This I have seen with my
own two eyes.)  This is exactly what companies did when a lot of women
were suddenly qualified for clerical work (they'd learned how to read &
write, and add columns of numbers).  The position of Secretary was 
made into ""women's work"" -- it had previously been a man's job, and a
steppingstone to higher management.  
Fair-minded people across the nation advocate comparable worth legislation.
Too bad you're not one of them.

You just got thru explaining that the reason women aren't ""making it""
is because of the influence of family and the surrounding culture.
Now you say it's the employers who are causing women to 
marry instead of pursue careers.  Which factor is it or which is dominant?

Fine, so let the secretary and waitress form unions and bargain for a 
reasonable wage.  But why should the government get into the act (ie., by
enforcing the same wage for ""comparably worth"" jobs)?  Would you like the 
government to say how much YOU and I are supposed to make in the future?

 ^^^^
Everybody is controlled, in a sense, by one's boss and to a lesser degree,
by society (i.e. everybody else).  In our society, those who have money
have a greater control over their lives and everybody else (in some other
society, one's political viewpoint, born status/race/sex, etc has more power).
Anyway, SOME class of people would have more say in any given society (we may
be created equal, but we may not have the same goal/achievement.)  What you
are proposing is to either give more power to the ""service class"" (I read 
""oppressed class"") so that they have the same influence or even control the 
""patrician class"" (the ""oppressor"").  Presumably, you would achieve this by 
paying the service class more (given that money is our measurement of power 
for this discussion).  But there is a catch, by raising some class of people's
wages, you automatically lower the wage for everybody else (in a sense).  Now
that we have to pay $10/hr for a waiter, an average dinner out would cost
everybody $40.  All supermarket goods would get more expansive because the
secretary upstairs, the cashier and the bagger all wants ""comparable worth""
(after all, a baggar requires no less skill than a ditch digger).  Do you
think the ""oppressor class"" people would just sit tight and suffer, NO, they
would demand higher wages and so does EVERYBODY ELSE.  So, who is the loser?
Really, comparable worth is such a quick and dirty fix that I am sure our
infinitely wise government (i.e., ourselves) would rush to embrace it (:-)
Witness comparable scheme such as farm and diary subsidy, city-transit subsidy,
and even minimum wage.  Minimum wage is justifiable (to me) because I accept 
the notion that we are entitled to some dignity if we work 8 hrs a day, 5 days
a week.  But just throwing money at something (be it our tax dollars or our

I get the strong impression that many on the net (not necessarily Ed)
would *now* like to put ""some *very* large pressures on women"" to take
the alternate course, ie a ""career"".  I get the same impression from
other areas as well as the net.

It appears to be very easy to forget that this ""societal predisposition""
is the direct result (and not the cause) of biology and evolution.
This is not a criticism of what Ed is saying but a gentle reminder to
other posters, many of whom seem to blame *men* for what was done by
*mother* nature.  [Sorry, I couldn't resist.]

[I really wanted to shorten that passage but it all seems relevant.]
It seems to me that *both* made sacrifices for what *they* wanted.
First, the husband sacrificed a career in neuro-biology, a field in
which, one must assume, he had more than a passing interest if he had
progressed all the way to post-doc work.  She found it ""very hard to
go back [to work] because her desire to do so was less than his.  I
know you are just trying to illustrate your point that ""society""
brainwashes women but it seems to me that she wasn't very well
brainwashed if she was a ""trained carpenter"" with a ""Bachelor's degree
from Radcliffe.""  It seems to me that a woman who has been able to fly
in the face of societal pressure to this extent and then *chose* *not* 
to return to work after their child was born did so precisely because
that is what *she* wanted from life.
Before you turn on the flame throwers, allow me to say that I am *not*
arguing against the reduction of societal pressures that cause women
not to choose nontraditional careers.  I do think, however, that we
had best think long and hard before we replace one form of
brainwashing with another.  The problem is, it seems to me, that of
societal pressure for *all* of us to fit into the same mold (actually,
there are two molds, I know) and the effort should be to reduce the
pressure to fit people to the respective mold rather than to merely to
reverse the direction of the pressure.  Again this is not directed so
much at Ed as prompted by his article.  Many seem intent on applying
as much pressure on women to have careers and ""productive lives"" as
has been applied in the other direction in the past, another
manifestation of the two wrongs make a right philosophy.
A matter of practical concern:  Several have suggested that after a
woman has interrupted her career to have a child, she should return to
work and the husband should now interrupt his career to care for the
child for a while.  This sounds good on the surface and in a utopian
world, it probably would be.  Certainly it would be fair but would it
be practical?  In this competitive world of ever rising cost of
living, does it make sense to interrupt *both* careers?  Think about
it before you start flaming at my ""male arrogance"" and remember that
neither I nor any other male designed the ""plumbing"" of either sex.

bedroom.  She's a dear.  Turned ""old"" (65) last fall.  She's been
working for her present employer for over 15 years now.  So after
working she insisted that I sit down and have a piece of pie (blueberry;
she's a fantastic cook, always was as far back as I can remember) and
talk for a bit.
Seems she had her annual review yesterday.  ""He [the supervisor] told me
I should be more aggressive,"" she said and that ""we can always do
better.""
""Sounds like he wants you to act ""uppity"" so he can fire you,"" I joked.
To my surprise, she answered seriously: ""That's what I figured, so I
just kept quiet.""
I'm relating this conversation to let you know that the hypothetical
discussions you've been having on this net are only as far away as
someone you know.  Or maybe you don't really know.  (I figure Ronald
Reagan doesn't personally know anyone black or poor.  You could probably
add quite a few other less-than-mainstream American types to that list.)
The fact is that after a dedicated career effort at one company, my
mother earns less than what most engineers will get the day they walk
out of college.  And she is accorded less professional respect than the
average white male high-school graduate (or, in some cases, dropout).
Sheryl and some of the other women who have been writing may be bitter
either because of their own experiences or those they have witnessed or
heard offrom others or both.  We men should be aware of the current of
thought that runs in the background of social and business life.  That
current consists of a whole bag of ""common knowledge"" about women's
motives and capabilities.  For example who was it (I ask rhetorically)
that first said that it was bad for women to get dirty, risk injury, or
do strenuous physical labor.  The U. S. armed forces still clings to
that philosophy, mind, in its insistence that women not perform combat
tasks.  The ""women and children first"" attitude, while attempting to
protect what men hold dear, denies equality.  For women who want their
fair chance to achieve and contribute in the broader society (not only
within the home and in the nurturing and raising of offspring) the
implicit inequality of such popularly held attitudes is insufferable.
So too, is the impression that a woman's absence from the work force
during the time she does raise her child(ren) is justification for lower
pay scales.  In my mother's case, by the time she returned to
work-for-pay status, the jobs for which she had been qualified no longer
existed.  She was willing to start a new career in an entry-level wage.
After fifteen years in which she learned quickly, maintained the highest
standards of quality in her work, and was refused advancement to most of
the positions she sought on the basis of any petty excuse, she is now
being told that she is ""too qualified"".  What the hell does that mean?
It means that they should have promoted her as her experience and
intelligence warranted.  Instead, she was held back because of sexual
(and age and racial) biases that exist in her company and at the
majority of firms in this country.
For those who have never knowingly experienced discrimination, I guess
it's hard to understand and believe.  For those of us who have
experienced it, you learn to recognize the sensation.  You know that if
you confront the party or parties directly on the issue, you will get a
denial or evasive response.  Would you or anyone you know answer ""yes""
if asked if the applicant for a position (or contributor of an idea or
whatever) were turned down because of sex or race?  In the workplace,
it's difficult to gather such evidence.  There are rarely written
records of the decision-making process or transcriptions of ""evaluation""
meetings.
I agree that some women as well as many men, over a rather lengthy
history, are responsible for the prevalent attitudes about women in the
workplace.  There are, for example, Phyllis Schlaffley and her ilk that
want to perpetuate women's second-class dependency as a demi-art form.
There are also, however, some enlightened men's groups -- not
particularly well known -- that are trying their best to make men more
aware of the learned attitudes that drive so much of their actions.  The
highly macho images dominating male-oriented advertising and the slinky,
clinging or surrendering females in the backgrounds are a vivid
testament to prevailing social values.
Some women might welcome, given the economic freedom to do so, the
opportunity to spend a majority of time encouraging the development of
children.  I contend that a (smaller) number of men (count me in) would
similarly welcome that kind of opportunity.  Nevertheless, the
prevailing economic conditions in America rule that option out for most
middle-income families in or near urban centers.  What that means is
that most women, like most men, seek jobs out of an economic necessity.
They expect the same career opportunities and remuneration.  They expect
that if they apply for a difficult job they will be considered on
qualifications and receive the same encouragement and support as a male
employee.
That's not what happened in my mother's case.  I suspect that her case
is similar to experiences of a great many women in the American work
force.  It has made her working days more tedious and far less rewarding
than they could have been.  Bias has promoted less qualified candidates,
at her expense, because they were of the ""correct"" gender or were
""buddies"" with the appropriate senior.  It has reduced her potential
earnings and, correspondingly, her available income at retirement.  And
perhaps what is saddest, it has denied her company and the national
economy the benefit of her intelligence, experience, and expertise.","V53humwx-fIJ",15,1985-07-10,24,1

Some of us do not believe that racism is morally defensible.  You obviously
do if it supports a cause you believe in.  Racism is a very loaded word,
and has all sorts of negative connotations.  AA is a more 'acceptable' term.
I consider them two faces of the same thing.  Since I do, I feel that if one
is wrong, so is the other.  You draw a distinction between them that I
feel is non-existant, and can therefore say one is good (i.e., you agree
with it) and one is bad (i.e., you don't agree with it).
>Supposing that affirmative action is ""racism""
>according to your favorite definition of the term, how does that
>prove that AA is wrong?
It doesn't, of course.  It shows the parallel between them.  You cannot
'prove' anything is 'right' or 'wrong' unless you agree on the postulates.
The universe is neither good nor bad -- it just IS.  You consider
discrimination based on sex/race/etc to be acceptable if it supports a
cause you believe in.  I am afraid my views are not so flexible.  And
I very strongly oppose government-mandated discrimination because that
institutionalizes (with my money) something I feel is wrong.  Also, if you
don't like a company, you can always leave.  There are a lot (millions)
of companies out there and one may be to your liking.  The choices available
if you don't like what the government does are much more restricted.
>(When the US fought Nazi violence in WW2

Yes, we did.  I still think so.  When the ends are sufficiently bad, they
do justify the means.  Judging where this point is is easy, of course
(just beyond wherever (generic you) want it to be).   And that is why the
argument is dangerous, because it can so easily give a rationalization to do
just about anything -- because YOU (generic) decide the ends are worth the
means (regardless of what those directly affected have to say).  In this
case, you (Richard) say that discrimating against people because they are
white males is justified because of discrimination which OTHER white males
inflicted on minorities.  Unfortunately, this punishes the innocent on the
basis of his color.  I do not consider that the ends justifies the means
in this case.

To look for a rational argument here is the point of this whole thing,

Disagreement is not an 'attack'.  As discussed above, any time you
wish to take actions which are harmful to someone, there has to be
a judgement as to whether the ends you expect to gain justify the
harm.  While I agree with your ends (to a certain extent -- I oppose
discrimination) I do not feel they justify the discrimination against
innocent (at least of discrimination in the marketplace) men.

No matter how it's defined?  You miss the point of my question.  Let
me put it this way:
Various people have stated, as an argument against affirmative
action, that it constitutes racism (and by implication sexism).  Now
either I don't understand this argument or it is completely bogus.
In order to clarify, please restate this argument without using the
terms ""racism"" or ""racist.""  Just substitute the definitions of those
terms for the words themselves, and let's see what the argument looks
like.  But I suspect that the word ""racism"" has been brought in
purely for its name-calling value, just as an opponent of surgery
might say that ""surgery is violence"" or a cop-hater might say that
""cops are killers"" (they do kill people).

OK.  From the article on ""Racism"" in the *Encyclopedia of Philosophy*
(an interesting article, BTW -- I recommend it to anyone with an
interest in the subject):
	RACISM is the doctrine that one group of men is morally or 
	mentally superior to another and that this superiority arises
	out of inherited biological differences.
From *A Dictionary of the Social Sciences*, ed. J. Gould & W.L. Kolb,
p. 571:
	Racism is the doctrine that there is a connection between
	racial and cultural traits, and that some races are
	inherently superior to others....
	The disagreement among scholars as to the word ""race"" does
	not extend to its derivative ""racism""; there is virtual
	agreement that it refers to a doctrine of racial supremacy.
	[Ruth] Benedict has defined ""racism"" as ""the dogma that one
	ethnic group is condemned by Nature to hereditary inferiority
	and another group is destined to hereditary superiority""
	(*Race, Science and Politics*).  Racism is more than race 
	prejudice.  It is a formal doctrine whose contemporary
	intellectual notions are derived from A. de Gobineau's *Essai
	sur l'inegalite' des races humaines*, published in 1853....
	Racism fuses national, ethnic, religious, and racial groups
	into an amalgam, the alleged inferiorities of which are 
	spuriously attributed to race alone.  J. Comas writes, ""Racism
	is quite different from a mere acceptance or scientific and
	objective study of the fact of race and the fact of the
	present inequality of human groups.  Racism involves the 
	assertion that inequality is absolute and unconditional, i.e.,
	that a race is inherently and by its very nature superior or
	inferior to others quite independently of the physical 
	conditions of its habitat and of social factors"" (""Racial
	Myths,"" in *The Race Question in Modern Science*).
From *Webster's 3rd International Dictionary*:
 Racism: 1.  The assumption that psychocultural traits and capacities
	are determined by biological race and that races differ
	decisively from one another, which is usually coupled with
	a belief in the inherent superiority of a particular race and
	its right to domination over others.
	2a.  A doctrine or political program based on the assumption
	of racism and designed to execute its principles.
	2b.  A political or social system founded on racism.
From the *Concise Oxford Dict.*:
 Racialism:  belief in superiority of a particular race; antagonism
	between different races.
 Racism:  1. = racialism.
       	  2.  theory that human abilities etc. are determined by race.
From the *American Heritage Dict.*:
 Racism:  1.  The notion that one's own ethnic stock is superior.
          2.  Discrimination or prejudice based on racism.
From *The Encyclopaedia Britannica*, 15th ed.:
 Racism:  the belief that some races are inherently superior to or
	different from others, based on the idea that inherited
	physical traits are accompanied by certain traits of
	personality, intellect, or culture.
(The word is too recent a coinage to appear in the OED.)  I'm not
going to risk a definition of affirmative action, but nothing that I
understand by the term satisfies a single one of the definitions
listed above.  So could we please stop saying that AA is racism, and
leave this kind of rhetoric to *National Review* and the like.

I believe the main argument of the proponents of AA is that it is
necessary in order to ensure that minorities are proportionately
represented in societies institutions, the lack of which proportionate
representation is essentially due to past discrimination.  They argue,
I believe that this end is important enough so that the governement
may discriminate on racial, sexist, etc. grounds in order to achieve
it.  (Correct me if I'm wrong)

Very few people are naive enough to believe that passing laws will eliminate

I've never had trouble getting a job, either (although I know women who had
good reason to believe that they didn't get jobs on the basis of gender --
usually in a corporate environment).  I have, however, had the experience
of being treated differently on the job, once I had it.  I'm fortunate enough
to be in a position now where I feel I'm being treated fairly indeed by my
employer, but I find that users seem to prefer talking to male staff.
Discrimination is *real*, Mr. Plamandon.  What do you suggest we do about
it -- have bigots read books explaining why racism/sexism isn't nice?

But clamping down on an employer because the ethnic makeup of his
employees doen't match the ""approved"" profile has only a vague
relation to actual acts of racism.  AA only effects members of
governmentally-approved minorities, anyway.  An employer with a
violent hatred of redheads, Californians, or bachelors will probably
be able to indulge his bigotries with the government's blessing, as
will women who despise men.
The other level is for victims to sue the people who discriminated
against them.  This isn't as popular as it might be, since you have
to have to be able to actually PROVE discrimination.  It's so much easier
to hang the innocent along with the guilty.

I suggest the government do NOTHING about it, since its competence,
sincerity, and immunity to the influence of the people it ""regulates""
are all suspect.
I suggest that individuals can have a strong effect without invoking
the government -- refuse to work for bigots.  Refuse to buy from
bigots.  Don't associate with them.
If you can't seem to find any non-bigots, you're probably living in
the wrong place.  Pull up stakes and move to a more enlightened
neigborhood.
Every time a talented individual refuses to work for a bigoted
employer, the employer's business suffers.  Ditto for when customers
stop buying from him.  Most industries are competitive enought that
it doesn't take a whole lot to tip the bozos into oblivion.
Don't wait for the government to come up with a magic wand to make
everything better.  They'll never find one.  All they have is
bureaucracy and taxpayers' money.  People have to live their own
lives as best they can, in a world that will always be screwed up,
one way or another.

As Richard Carnes has pointed out, ""racism"" implies a doctrine of

Colin, I think you got a problem here.  First off, my response to alice!jj
has been interpreted by you as ""we aren't talking. . ."".  Frankly, I
didn't know you spoke for alice!jj. Granted that ""we"" post to the net so
that other's might read our opinions, don't you feel you are taking it a
little far interpreting what jj meant?
Not that I should be surprised, since you evidently feel qualified to further
determine what I mean to talk about (in your last line above).  I've been
very busy lately, true, and haven't been caught up on reading, let alone
posting, but please grant me the right to speak for myself.  You really don't
need to waste your time trying to do it for me.
Thirdly, I'm not sure that your definition of AA is correct.  It is seen as
a means of stopping discrimination.  Whether or not anyone considers AA
""fair"" probably requires some kind of poll.  Is a flat tax rate more ""fair""
than a graduated rate?  Govt. isn't interested in ""fair"" so much as in
""effective"" (which, in the case of AA is also arguable).  What AA _has_
done is offer grounds for suit, and lawsuits have done a good deal toward
evening things up -- and they certainly are not ""fair"".
I do have a certain sense of the inevitability of equality (don't you???)
simply because the marketplace has changed so drastically.  The economy
won't be able to support such disparities in incomes given our tax methods
and transfer payments.  However, that doesn't mean I'm complacent -- after
all, I work _right now_.  I'd be a lot happier if the distinction between
classes and sexes ceased to exist simply because it would make things
easier.  I consider AA worthy of support because it is accomplishing some
of these goals and is better than nothing.  So far, ""nothing"" is what has
been suggested by the opponents of AA.
I'd be happy to entertain other ideas, if they were presented.

You have just pointed out the necessity of AA. The law mandates equal
opportunity. Discriminatory employers refuse to implement the law fairly.
(Just saying ""you can't discriminate"" DOES NOT WORK, historically)
So now what. Should Government, which theoretically also represents
those discriminated agains, just say ""too bad, we tried, but those evil
employers just won't stop"" ? Racist and sexist people will continue to be
so. However, they should, they MUST not be allowed to impose their
prejudices on others.

If an individual or a group takes away your property without your permission,
I presume you consider that immoral.  Why then is it not immoral for the
government to do so?  On what moral basis can the government be said to have
such priveliges.

You equate ""illegal"" with ""immoral"", rather the way Moral Majority believes
that anything ""immoral"" should be ""illegal"".  The law is powerful force
for good and evil (but mostly evil).  I would think it wise to avoid
trying to make everything illegal on the spur of the moment.

Is your argument: ""I can't stop paying taxes to support an immoral war
machine, so I'm going to use the coercive instrument to make even more
people have to do something immoral.""  Wouldn't it make more sense to stop
*forcing* everyone to pay for the government, and allow it to be funded
voluntarily?  Why not extend this idea of voluntarism and peace to allow
voluntary peaceful action concerning discrmination, and keep the government
and its coercion out of it?

If the government started to round up innocent people and kill them,

The current form of affirmative action isn't law; it is administrative

""Poorly"" here is a matter of judgement.
In order for quotas not to cause those who are less than the best available
applicants to be hired over such the best qualified ones, the ratio of
minority to non-minority applicants in the pool would have to be exactly
as those in the quotas, for all jobs that quotas are applied to.  The odds

Yes, and one of the imperfections is that they force employers to

All employers are forced to do so, regardless of whether or not they
discriminated in the past.

You have not given the end of the story. I assume that the MCAD, after
looking at your father's files, went away satisfied that no discrimination
had occurred (they could also look at whether or not your father had made some
effort at advertising his firm as open to black employees, something
I also assume he had done) Given that, I'd say the system worked.
Your father made good faith efforts to integrate his work force, sexually
and racially, which is all that is required of him under the law.
No government can and should hold the lack of applicants against him
*in a good faith recruiting effort* environment.
As for the employees of MCAD being stupid. Maybe you're right. Maybe there
is too few of them for an effective policing job. However, the company
you mention, which I'll again assume (lots of assuming; that'll get me
in trouble...) was all white on purpose, is reason for the existence
of such a government body, wouldn't you say?

I wouldn't argue that women and children's jobs weren't at one time
very dangerous and very dirty; I might argue that men's jobs were riskier,
but I'm not sure that it is easy to measure.  Certainly in recent history,
women's jobs have been, overall, less dangerous.  (Note, my original
comments were observing *why* the notion of ""men's work"" and ""women's work""
came about, without any notion of ""right"" or ""wrong"" being associated.)

Men have no special claim to dirty and dangerous work *until the middle
of this century* at least in America.  I think this issue is worth
considering; I don't claim that no discrimination based on sex has ever
existed, and I don't claim that it doesn't exist now.  I think a little
more thought about the origins of the 59 cent figure are useful.

I'm sure glad you put that word ""voluntarily"" in quotes, because the
arm twisting (threats to cut off contracts) is not *quite* the same as
a truly voluntary situation.  In the case of colleges, though, the
government requires colleges to abide by EEO and AA rules, even if the
college has no control over receiving federal funds (e.g. students
receiving federal grants which go directly the student).  While I would
agree that usually the problem is an employer who is engaged in 
discriminatory practices, it is unfair to those employers who are not
discriminating, and just happen to have a low percentage of the
""right"" groups.

There is no other way.  In fact, the method you have proposed, i.e.,
""some percentage standard,"" cannot accomplish this either, because
percentage standards necessarily discriminate against people on the
basis of their race, sex, etc., and are, therefore, rascist, sexist,
etc. by definition.

the attitudes are significantly dissimilar.  I believe Cramer was saying that
these two attitudes are similar in that they both treat people as members

But they *don't* have their fair share of opportunity.  That's the
problem.  Without job hiring practises being based upon ""best suited
for the job"" ""fair share of opportunity"" is impossible in specific
cases (and that's all a specific person cares about).  Particularly
if a group of applicants for a job (or classification) are not evenly 
distributed (same ratios as society) as to race, sex or whatever.
For most people in a position to hire people (at least in the computer
industry) I believe that the primary criteria for hiring people is that
they find the best person for the job.  I don't think racial/sexual
biases are particularly prevalent anymore especially in highly technical 
areas (though handicapped *might* be).  Having to pass over more highly
qualified people to fill out a blanket quota will only serve to create
more racism/sexism.  Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that
a particular minority is less or more suited for a particular position -
but abstracting from the population as a whole down to individual
cases and professions result in truncation errors.
I recognize that much of the reason for disproportionate groups of
applicants for particular positions is frequently due to a bias-caused
lack of education/experience on the part of some minorities.  But,
past prejudice doesn't alleviate the fact of someone not being
best-of-the-applicants qualified for a particular job *now*.
Considering the long way society has come since the '30s and '40s it
would be far better to let things alone and the problem of discrimination
will disappear as it has been doing - things have been happening
without anybody really noticing.  Racial/sexual/whatever quotas 
will bring back the prejudices and hatred of the 40's - only worse
because the object of this hatred is mixed into the workplace.  Then
everybody will be involved in it.  You can see this happening up
here due to long-standing hiring policies of the Canadian Govt.
w.r.t. French speaking employees.
It is getting very near the point where employers are not allowed
to discriminate against incompetence.

What's that supposed to mean?  Federal employees who are not French
monolinguals hate those who are?  Bilingual employees are hated by
monolinguals because people HAVE to be bilingual in senior positions
in this bilingual country?  Come off it!  I don't know where the machine
""mnetor"" is, but it doesn't seem to be in Ottawa, and if it is a Federal
Government machine in Toronto, there is almost NO language requirement
other than English for any but the most senior positions.
I haven't heard from francophone bilinguals working in the Federal Government
that they feel hated, or that they hate anglophones (bilingual or
otherwise).  The only places I have come across anti-French ""hatred""
are in newspaper reports out of rural districts of Manitoba and westward,
where they object to bilingual cereal boxes as ""pushing French down our
throats.""  In Manitoba, there was a great fuss about giving the substantial
French-speaking population equal legal rights with the English speakers,
but that was hardly affirmative action in the workplace; it was simple
bigotry of people afraid that allowing others equal rights might in
some way jeopardize their own position.  I guess a lot of this antipathy
to affirmative action, ERA and so forth comes from this same fear (but not
all; there have been some rational arguments as well).

Melinda, I'm sure that this entirely unsupportable conclusion works well
to inspire emotional militancy among the liberal sectors.  It is both
sophistic and highly unfair to brand anyone who opposes affirmative action
as a white male supremacist, as you have above.  It is just as incorrect
to claim ""all persons holding this position on the issue"" are racist/sexist
as it is to say that ""all women (blacks, hispanics, Irish, left-handed,
whatever)"" are inherently inferior in some way.  In both cases, large
aggregates of human beings are summarily lumped together and blamed
with something that varies from individual to individual.
Extreme positions such as yours unfortunately serve best those on the
other side of your argument, by undermining the more sober, realistic
and logical arguments those on your side might make.
Any way you slice it, to allow a person's sex, race, religion, etc.
to enter into the decision to hire, grant credit, or any other opportunity
is de facto discrimination, and is unfair to those who lose out as a
result.  It makes no difference whether the favored criterion supports
or opposes historical modes of prejudice.
When those who compete for employment or other considerations are
considered *entirely as if* the person making the ultimate decision
in each case were totally unaware of the applican't sex, race, or
any other characteristic unrelated to the nature of the consideration,
then and only then will the vestiges of old prejudices die out.
I hope I see the day, but your position, Melinda, unfortunately is
doing nothing to speed its arrival - perhaps quite the opposite.
The following posting (which I have trimmed) speaks very well on the
matter:

Where women and minorities lose out is generally in experience, a lot of
them are only now getting the chance to break into exclusively white male
fields. From these opportunities they WILL get the chance to progress, that
is why there is legislation in force. In time the percentages of women,etc
in all levels will rise, dramatically over the next decade, and then at a
more gradual pace after that (my opinion only).
The human race generally evolves at it's own pace, if left alone, now if anyone

Let's make several assumptions for the sake of argument:
	1. you are running a company of some sort.
	2. you are in an area that is 51% female and 11% black.
	3. three quarters of your job applicants are black.
	4. you are actively hiring.
	5. job applicants' qualifications are independent of color.
	6. you are required to keep your workforce 11% black.
You now have two choices: either allow your workforce to become more
than 11% black, or hire whites who are less qualified than blacks.
If you do the latter, you are compromising your business.
Is it OK to hire more than 11% blacks in these circumstances?
If so, is it OK to hire less than 11% blacks if 99% of the applicants
are white?","-Sf5HRXgYbUJ",10,1985-05-30,7,1

The war was a special case - the male workforce was so tied up with
being part of the war that females HAD to be employed to manufacture
goods.  There was no less sexual discrimination - males would still
have been hired preferentially but there weren't enough to fill all the
jobs nor were women treated fairly for promotion.  As soon as the war
ended most women were kicked out of the workforce immediately.  Though
a case can be made that there was less discrimination afterwards
because exposure and experience to women in the workforce made it more
acceptable to many the overall level of discrimination didn't really
change much during or after.  There was a movie that we saw recently 
with Sally Field (I forget the title) which demonstrated this pretty well.
Discrimination is obvious when there aren't enough jobs around to
employ everybody.  If there are jobs to employ everybody, it doesn't
necessarily follow that there is no discrimination.  Discrimination
during levels of low-unemployment merely is more subtle (and possibly
more damaging because of ""but we do hire lots of minorities"" - sort
of like ""some of my best friends are <choose your favorite minority>"")
There aren't any affirmative action policies in Canada yet (except
for the bilingualism program).  Didn't you see the stuff in the papers
recently about the report on employment integration and proposed
affirmative action?  (Sorry, I can't quite remember the name of the woman
who wrote the report, nor the title)   That would have been just about 
the first instance of official affirmative action in this country.
I know that (I don't have statistics, but it is *obvious* from society)
that most of the lessening of discrimination in the workplace 
started long before official affirmative action policies became common.  The
minorities are very much better represented in the workforce in Canada now
than they were in the 00's-mid 60's in spite of the fact that very 
few places in Canadian society have affirmative action policies even now.  
One primary example: until the late fifties IBM (at least in one of the
sites here) consisted almost solely of crew-cut WASP males with white shirts
and unmarried women in menial jobs (females were fired when they got 
married - that *was* official policy!).  Currently, the place I worked in 
IBM actually has considerably more women and other minorities than strict 
population percentages would dictate.  Mind you, some is due to carry-over 
of U.S. affirmative action policies into Canada.  But I do believe that 
most of this is a result of attitude changes before there were 
affirmative action policies.  Actually, strict affirmative action 
adherence would probably *decrease* minority representation in the 
area I was in at IBM.  (That would be a great mistake too!)
My comments were primarily directed against official ""affirmative 
action"" policies.  I have no quibble with ""equal rights/access"" 
provisions in our constitution or other legislation.  I should 
have made that clear in my original posting.

What does the machine or whom I'm working for have to do with it?  Just
because I live in Toronto doesn't mean that I cannot know Federal
employees in Ottawa - I know quite a few - some that work in the
same place that you do!  I used to work in Ottawa and I once worked
for the Ontario Govt. too.  I know people who work for the Federal Govt.  
(some in relatively high places I'm afraid to say) that are *extremely*
biased against the bilingual requirements (and imagined monolingual
French privileges) and those who are hired/promoted because of it 
(or imagined to).  One of them would give Hitler a run for the money in 
""most vituperative/racist thinking sweepstakes"" (and he *isn't* a 
friend of mine either!  The reason he is not being promoted is because
he's a jerk not because he's not French or bilingual).  The Ontario 
Govt. isn't free of these attitudes either in spite of the fact 
that Ontario isn't officially bilingual (yet) and has very few (if 
any) bilingual hiring policies.
Nor, as you contend, are the Federal bilingual policies directed *only* at
high level employess.  The bilingual policy is directed at almost
every level of Federal employment where contact with the public occurs.
(and, to me it makes sense too!)
The hatred that I'm concerned about is not necessarily based upon a ""fact""
of discrimination but on the perception.  Affirmative action:
	1) Doesn't take into account the fact that minorities are
	   disproportionately represented (either plus or minus) in 
	   the class of people qualified *now* for a particular area of 
	   the workforce.
	2) Provides an excuse (and spawning ground for hatred) for
	   those people not hired because of affirmative action either
	   in truth or in fiction:
		a) An unqualified applicant takes the easy way out
		   and blames non-hiring/promotion upon discrimnatory 
		   policies (and those horrible people taking
		   *his* job) rather than his own inadequacies.
		b) A better-qualified applicant (who has mouths to 
		   feed too!) being turned down simply because he was 
		   the wrong minority.
We have to face the fact that affirmative action is *not* fair to the
individual - particularly the one who has to pay for past injustices by
other people.  Consider the following situation: Women have justifiable
complaint about their representation in the workforce.  What happens
if the hiring (or promotion) group already has filled their quota
on women, but has to fill quota with another minority.  A women turned
down under those circumstances is *still* being discriminated against
because she's a women.  And, she will probably still come to the same
conclusion that she has been discriminated against.  People usually
don't really care *why* the discrimination exists, only the fact
that *they* *were* discriminated against.  If we don't have affirmative 
action, but still have ""equal access on ability"" policies, then it is 
*both* fair to everyone *and* will correct the existing injustice in 
the long term.  
Things have been changing a lot faster without official affirmative action 
policies than you think!  Just look around, there's *far* more minority 
involvement at all levels than there used to be.  As a few examples, 
ten years ago there weren't *any* female newscasters, newspaper publishers 
or VP-upwards executives.  People tend to forget what things were like 
even only five years ago.
Official affirmative action creates and/or perpetuates division between 
groups - it doesn't do anything to eliminate it.

Pure crap!  What have you been reading or not reading for that matter?
Are you sure that you live in the same country?  I assume that you are, 
because D.C.I.E.M. is less than 10 miles from where I live and work, but
you certainly don't seem to know what's going on.
If you think that anti-French sentiment is restricted to the west of
Canada, you are sadly mistaken.  It exists in Ontario, parts of Quebec
(they aren't all French!) and in the Maritimes - it is quite possibly
highest in Ottawa!  Where, for example, do you think that Ottawans
figure that the criminals who perpetuate the highest bank-robbery
rates outside of Quebec come from anyways?  Hull! (just across the
Ottawa river which is the Ontario/Quebec border for you people not 
knowing the geography).  They're probably right, but drawing the 
distinction is what matters.  Nor does it matter whether the object 
of the sentiment (French Mono/Bi lingual) know it or not.  It's a lot 
better than it was (say than during WW II) but it still exists.
It's unpleasant but true.  Fortunately, all the companies I have
worked for don't discriminate (much...).
The Manitoba (and you forgot New Brunswick) situation doesn't really
have much to do with access to employment per-se.  Most of it is an
irrational fear of becoming unequally represented in law, taxation,
education, and Govt. services.  Even I get extremely uncomfortable when
Quebec wants to have the ability to veto any legislation that effects
them in any way.  No other province would have that much power.
Somehow that seems to mean that the rest of the country has less than
equal control over their destiny.

In the workplace today, there are certain occupations where the
overwhelming majority of workers and prospective workers are women
or men, due to societal pressures, ""tradition"", or whatever. Things may
be changing, but in some occupations this is still fact.
What the above definition of affirmative action does is impose
quotas on a business.  About 51% of your employees must be women,
about 49% must be men, (the rest I guess could be anything), and
similarly for a racial distribution.  I am assuming that these
quotas are based on national figures, as the racial makeup of
different areas of the country can be quite disparate.
These quotas are inherently unfair, in my view, because one of the
primary determinations of an applicant's fitness for a job would be
whether or not the applicant was of the proper race and sex.
In a job occupation such as nursing, male nurses would benefit
unfairly because of their sex, not because their ability.  Now it's
true that we seem to be talking about quotas based on a company-wide
basis, so nursing might apply to a hospital, where there are other
professions working as well.  But there would still have to be
juggling among all of the personnel to get the quotas for the whole
hospital to come out right. [We need x male janitors to counter the
y female nurses we hired...etc., etc.,]  And thus we have people
being hired as much because of their race or sex as because of their
ability.
You could also turn the whole example around using a technical firm
that hires a lot of engineers.  In this case, the quotas would be
more than fair to females and minorities because a primary
consideration in their hiring would be their race and/or sex.
It would be conceivable under such a system that I couldn't hire
people I wanted to hire because they weren't of the proper sex or
race.  To me, that's not fair.
What is fair?  Well, my company's affirmative action policy as I
understand it comes pretty close I think.  First and foremost in
consideration is the applicant's ability, along with experience,
personability, would the applicant get along well with others, etc.
Then, and only then, would affirmative action considerations come
into play.  Essentially, the policy is to use affirmative action
considerations to break a tie that can't reasonably be broken in any
other way.  But along with this are workshops held here to let
current employees gain an understanding of the problems faced by
minorities and women and to explain the affirmative action policy, plus
presentations at schools and other places encouraging minorities and
women to consider applying.
Job discrimination is a problem.  But it is a problem that isn't
going to be solved by simply changing which groups are the target of
such discrimination.  I, for one, will fight against such quotas 
until they put the last nail in my coffin.

Under this argument we might as well go back to separate facilities for
blacks and whites.  We may as well return to the days when bus companies
(often publicly owned and operated) decided that one of their ""rights""
was to make black people ride in the back of the bus for no other reason
than being a different color.  We might as well return to the days
when people had to pay to vote - after all their voting may interfere
with ""employer's property rights"".
 
This same argument could be used to justify wholesale firing of Jews:
after all, employers can do anything they want, including discriminate
against a whole group of people.
 
Employers have every right to hold racist and sexist attitudes.
That does *not* give them the right to blatantly discriminate against
people because they don't like the color of their skin.
The rule of law in a democracy calls for *equal treatment under the law*.
 
Again, I will point out that the point of affirmative action programs is
*not* to promote unequal treatment - it is to promote equal treatment for
women and minorities who have been and are currently being discriminated
against.
When the exact same resume yields the male name an interview and not
the female name, then this seems to me to be strong evidence of
unconscious prejudice on the part of employers.  It is this prejudice
that affirmative action programs are designed to compensate for.
 
I am appalled at the acceptance of rascism implied by Mr. Sykora's
argument.
I hope that he will retract it.

A study just released by a group at Stanford shows that women in technical
fields make less than men, and hold fewer management positions, by *more*
than the natinal average.  In other words, discrimination in the high-tech
world is worse.  My own observations seem to yield the same conclusions

Things have been happening - maybe without people noticing, but if
so only because they're happening too slowly - only because people
continue to *do* things about it.  If we stop actively striving for
equality, then we'll surely degenerate back to where we were - maybe
as far back as the early 19th century and beyond.  Remember those times
from your history lessons (you *did* study basic history in school,
didn't you) when people were actually *bought and sold*?  I sure don't

I'm curious about something here.  While I agree with the first comment
(AA is MORE THAN a fair shot), I wonder if the stats quoted by JB are
(1) accurate and (2) represent proportions of the WORKING population.
Is AA truly an attempt to enforce equity, or is it a drawn-out guilt
trip?  Why shouldn't employers/recruiters be free to hire on the basis
of qualifications?
Maybe I'm naive in this, but it seems to me that while the population
may be 51% female, the working population is not.  I live in a nice
suburban area (called Silicon Valley :-)) and find that there are many
women who not only are not part of the working population, but do not
wish to be.  How does that fit in?  In general, I resent any RULE which
restricts my freedom to hire.  Is it rational to be able to discriminate
on the basis of tobacco smoking but not on criminal record or sexual
preference?  Don't misunderstand - I am opposed to discrimination on the
basis of anything other than qualifications.  But either the whole thing
has to hold together or it should be canned.

This is *not true*.  Affirmative Action does *not* mean that any employer
*must* hire 51% women , 11% blacks, and x% other minorities.  It means
that employers should strive to attain these goals and make progress
towards attaining them.

Again, this is simply *not* true. Nobody is saying that any black high school
dropout can apply for a job as a programmer and any other kind of job and
get hired simply because she is black. The *primary* determinants of any
hiring decision are qualifications to do the job.  The fact is that in
many fields there are actually many more people qualified to do the job
than there are job openings.  The other fact is that discrimination has been
entrenched in many places and exists today.  Right now there is not a single
black dancer in the Rockettes of Radio City Music Hall. Not one.  In fact
there have been over 5000 Rockettes since they were founded-and in over 40 years
not a single one of them has been black, red or anything but lily-white.
Is this because there are no qualified black female dancers? Certainly not.
It is because of an entrenched policy of white only dancers.
The same thing occurs on a smaller scale throughout this country sad to say.

If somebody is unequivocally the best-qualified applicant then 
there is nothing to stop that person being hired so long as s/he
is a U.S. citizen.  However if ""I want to hire fellow white good ole
boys"" *because they are ""white good ole boys"" then that is unfair.  
In fact that is what often happens.
Affirmative Action programs attempt to counter that inherent bias.

Your company's affirmative action policy, Mark, is *precisely* what
affirmative action programs are! They are not ""mandated quotas"" they are
not meant to make hiring decisions based solely upon race or sex, they
are not meant to discriminate against *any* group.  They are meant to
give groups which have always been discriminated against an even break.
The Rockettes are simply one among thousands of groups and organizations
which have not given discrminated groups an even break.

Affirmative action doesn't require anyone to pass judgment on you on
the basis of your race or sex.  It makes your race or sex one
criterion among others for the employer's decision on whether to hire
you, within the specific context defined by a particular AA program.

This is our old friend the argument from name-calling.  It generates
heat rather than light, so could we please refrain from using it on
the net?  
In my everyday encounters with people, I treat women and blacks
somewhat differently from white males, that is, my knowledge of a
person's race or sex can and usually does affect my actions in some
way.  Part of the reason for this difference is my knowledge that
both groups suffer from deep-rooted and tenacious prejudices in our
society, and that this is an important factor in the life of each
individual woman or black.  This does not mean that I have judged the
individual to be better or worse merely because he or she is black or
female, and I don't see how it makes me a racist or sexist.

the employer is making a judgement; he/she is judging your ability to fill

---------------------------------------------------------
First, I find that many white males are promoted for reasons other 
than education, experience, competency, etc. and that even
when those reasons are a factor, other factors also come into
play. People are promoted or hired or not fired because they go to church
with the person making the decision (or someone known to the
person making the decision), because they belong to the same
fraternity, because they lived in the same town or because they 
went to the same school. People who have these kinds of close
personal contacts with those in power are more likely to get
breaks than those who don't. Because of America's habits &
history, blacks are less likely to live in the same
towns/neighborhoods with whites, less likely to attend the
same schools or belong to the same fraternities, social clubs
or churches. Women are also less likely to have professional
or quasi-professional contacts with the males in power.
Therefore, AA policies help to make up for the difference in
access to opportunities that currently exists.
Second, I think one thing AA tries to do is question what
really constitutes valid ""experience."" Let's consider the case
of medical school admissions. I would suggest that the
experience of being discriminated against (which IS the case
for most blacks and women) has made them, in general, less arrogant than
white males. I would also suggest that the arrogance of the
white male medical establishment is one reason for the
skyrocketing malpractice insurance & higher medical costs.
Shouldn't the experience of not thinking you were born god of
the universe be considered as a valid criterion in evaluating
medical school admissions? Being the child of a doctor is
considered a valid criterion--how many blacks have had that
opportunity denied to them? And wouldn't someone who grew up
in a ghetto be more willing to practice there AND better at it
than some rich WASP from the suburbs whose dad was a doctor?
I personally would rather go to a black doctor who made B's in
college & didn't think s/he knew everything in the world than
some arrogant white male who got all A's but forgot that I was
a human being. The truth of the matter is that I don't have to
make that choice--actually, most black & female medical school
graduates are MORE qualified (in terms of their grade point
averages than white males--& in my experience, generally far
more sensitive.)
Medical school is one example, but I suggest that there are
many professions and jobs in which the experiences that this
sexist and racist society forces blacks and women to undergo
gives blacks and women a qualification that
employers/admissions people/whomever need to consider in
evaluating performance.

Or perhaps you need militants pushing for revolution to force
the more conservative majority to ""evolve."" Do you really
think that if the 60s, with its militant push for civil rights

Some number of states, for example, Kentucky & Minnesota have special programs
to benefit disadvantaged citizens from particular, primarily ""white"" regions 
of their states (Appalachia & the Iron Range, respectively). I happen to know 
about these programs because I have lived in those states. These programs
do not seem to receive the national attention that AA programs do.
My point is twofold: 
1) There ARE programs in place that primarily benefit whites/men. 
2) People don't complain about them either because they are accepted as part
of the status quo (& I'm not saying that those people in Appalachia &
the Iron Range don't NEED help) or that people don't somehow consider that
discrimination.

Either life is radically different in Canada or you just haven't talked to
many of the people who've been discriminated against. 
Recruiters tend to hire people they like, & in many cases the people they like
are like themselves. If, for historical reasons, the people who hired the
recruiters are white males, the recruiters are going to take the work of
white males more seriously.
Also, discrimination is not always overt, nor does it simply start at the
job market. In my high school, girls weren't allowed in the computer club.
(This is a public high school, mind you.) Recent studies have shown that
even when girls allowed to use the computers that teachers still tend to 
let the boys use them more often. Girls are less likely to be encouraged
to stay in advanced math classes.

I don't think the prejudice is ""past.""
And have you *never* worked with an incompetent white male? I hear all
of these complaints about AA discriminating against these postively
brilliant white males who are incredibly overqualified & I look around
me, & when I look at the people who are incompetent, whom do I see in amazingly
disproportionate numbers? Despite the alleged ""reverse discrimination"" of
AA? White males.
If the ""best-of-the-applicants"" were all that were/are considered without
AA then how did all this white male dead weight get to where it is?

Before there were quotas, there was EEO, which stipulated
that people/companies shouldn't discriminate. People continued
discriminating. Companies, ignoring the call of the allegedly
""free"" marketplace (which would presumably encourage them to
hire the ""best qualified"" candidate regardless of race, sex,
etc.), continued to discriminate. 
The government then set up guidelines for ideal minority/female employment. 
These guidelines were not 51% for women and 11%, but much
lower & tailored to job type/regions. For instance, if 10% of all
graduating B.E.E. people were women for a given year, the
government guidelines suggested that 10% of the new hires in
EE-related fields be women. Regardless of the fact that women's 
GPA's tend to be somewhat higher than men's (which would lead one to 
believe that in a ""free"" market, the best jobs would be more likely to
go to women & fewer women would be without jobs), companies
still failed to meet the guidelines. Many companies failed to
even come *near* the guidelines.
Depending on how miserably & flagrantly the companies thumbed
their noses at the government's guidelines, the government
retaliated with quotas.
You and I both work for AT&T. In the 60-70s, AT&T suffered a few 
class action suits & basically instituted the AA policy that you suggested
was fair. AT&T did not do so, as I understand the company's
history, because it particularly cared about women or blacks
but because it had enough other kinds of lawsuits pending
(from within & without the government) wanted to avoid ones
about discrimination. So it came up with a voluntary policy &
even attempts to enforce the policy so that it doesn't have to worry
about government-imposed quotas.
Other companies were less distracted, less foresighted, sleazier
& more bigoted. The government then imposed quotas on them.
I think you underestimate what a fundamentally decent company
we work for--what do you do with companies that defy the law?
AA is a tool in implementing the goals of the 1965 Civil
Rights Act. It is a tool that was used by the Justice
Department until 1981, & was applied differently to different
situations. There is NO law anywhere that says in all
occupations everywhere, the nation must have 51% female
employment & 11% black employment. It is only a tool that is
used to enforce the law. The Reagan Administration chooses not
to use it, but has not substituted any other tool to replace
it. One reason I am so interested in defending AA is that I
have yet to see a better tool (& yes this is a flawed one, but
what IS the alternative--the only real one I've heard
suggested is to wait for society to ""evolve."" It's a funny
concept of law & justice to say that my best hope is to work
so that my greatgranddaughter gets the justice I am denied). 
In discarding this tool, it seems as if the Reagan Administration 
has given up enforcing the law altogether (RR WAS against the 1965 
Civil Rights Act when it came out, you know). I find that idea 
far more repugnant than quotas imposed on lawbreakers. 
Why are AA quotas seen as more offensive than forcing
companies to comply with the Clean Air Act? In 1965, the government
said it's illegal to discriminate, just as the government said
that it is illegal to pollute. In the late 60s, the government
saw that many industries polluted & many discriminated.
To rectify this problem, suggested guidelines were drawn up in
both instances. Those companies which complied, like AT&T,
were left alone (on that issue :-}). Those which did not were 
regulated more carefully.
How would you like to see the government enforce the law?
Are you suggesting that the government should not enforce the
law? Isn't it a violation of RR's oath of office not to
enforce the law?
When companies violate the 1965 Civil Rights Act, what would
YOU have the government do to force them to comply?

A conclusion as to whether or not there is more discrimination in the

Does anyone have statistics to show that AA results in a significant
number of less qualified or unqualified persons being hired?  So far
all I have heard is anecdotal evidence, but storytelling is suspect
when the issue is ideologically charged, as with AA.  Also, it's
often possible to bring a less well qualified person up to standard
by training.

Again, I'd like to see some hard evidence that AA fosters racist
attitudes among the white working class, many of whom are already
sufficiently racist.  Even assuming it does, is that a good reason to
oppose it?  Desegregation and the civil rights activism of the 60's
generated a white backlash that aided George Wallace.  I'm not sure
that this means that the sit-ins and marches were a bad idea.  
I'd also like to hear some constructive suggestions from the
opponents of AA as to how to end the caste-like division of our
society in which some groups are perceived as innately inferior, a
division which perpetuates itself over the generations.  Racial and
sexual prejudice and discrimination are alive and well in 1985.
Saying that economic rationality will solve the problem doesn't cut
it:  it just assumes away the problem.  Prejudice and the resulting
discrimination are by definition irrational; the fact that economic
rationality often conflicts with this irrationality isn't sufficient
to show that rationality will win out.  I've seen lots of crocodile
tears (especially from the Reagan Admin.) about discrimination and
not much in the way of workable suggestions for ending it.  Nothing
is more powerful than an idea whose time has come because it serves
the self-interest of powerful people; and nothing mobilizes stronger
ideological opposition than an idea that threatens the privileged
position of the powerful, such as the well-off white males whose
interests the Reagan Administration looks after.

You're right that my rhetoric was getting out of hand in that
article; but let me point out that you and others have referred to
affirmative action as ""government-promoted racism.""  It's both absurd
and insulting to its supporters to call a program ""racist"" whose
whole purpose is to attack racial, ethnic, and sexual prejudice and
their effects.  It's mere name-calling as a substitute for rational

Life must be different in Canada - most of the places (IBM, AES and
BNR - all pretty big companies) that I have worked at have been balanced 
pretty well - some disproportionately well.  I've had lots of opportunity 
to talk to people who were in the groups that are supposed to be 
discriminated against.

Recruiters hiring people that they know (somehow, via Church, clubs,
social groups etc.) or indirectly know of because of what area they
are in the social group isn't necessarily discrimination.  Many times
it makes perfect sense because the recruiter already knows what they
are like.  It's a lot safer to hire a known person than someone that
you know from nothing more than an half an hour interview.
Yes, maybe the inclusion of certain minorities in certain groups
(eg: particular religious denominations) isn't proportionate.
Sometimes that may be discrimination (and usually past discrimination)
That can be a problem.  However, would you like to impose a requirement
that 10% of all Catholics in the U.S. must be black?
Then again, most of the recruiters that I have dealt with have been
female anyways.

What!  Holy smokes, you'd never get away with that in most cities in
Canada.  Amateur hockey is even becoming co-ed (tho slowly).

Most of it is.  I have had conversations with a lot of people (in
various minorities) that have said the same thing.

Of course - lots of times.  But, at one place where I worked (one of the
companies has AA carryover from the States) almost all of the people
in my dept. were incompetent, and almost all from minorities.

It's been my experience that incompetence is pretty well distributed
amongst various groups, except for a possible increase among white
or near-white (but not WASP) males AND females.

Prior prejudice.  Even if there was currently a lot of prejudice, most
of the ""white male dead weight"" would have gotten there during prior
times (they didn't all get hired last week!) during the obviously higher
levels of discrimination.

JJ-->  I've been talking about education from EARLY CHILDHOOD everytime
the subject has EVER come up in net.politics, in fact, I've been
talking about it on nutnews from before the time that there WAS
a nut.politics.
I'll repeat it once more.
You CANNOT keep a person who's been educated and who has learned
to EXPECT, as a matter of courtesy, equal behavior down given the
current Civil Rights laws, discrimination of literate, well
educated people is just simply more effort than even most of
the worst bigots are willing to put out.   The malicious bigots
will allways exist, of course. <And can be firmly dealt with
given current (and some changes in the future, one would hope,
to include women and white males, in fact, ALL people) laws.>
I hardly claim that the world is perfect, but destroying people's
self respect via AA(and via discrimination, sexism, and 
other forms of sheer stupidity)  and expecting them to convey a good sense of
self to their offspring is a ridiculous position.
There are many psychological studies of the results of Hopelessness
and Helplessness, where the person learns that their situation and
environment are independant of their behavior.  Ghettos,
racial crime <from minorities toward the ""authority""> and many other
things are clearly indicated as the results of hopelessness.
In order to emiminate these things, one must remove the CAUSE.
It is ESSENTIAL that people be shown that there is hope, and that
they can make changes in their life VIA THEIR OWN <constructive> ACTIONS!!!, 
and that this lesson be conveyed to the offspring.   Current
AA methods don't do this very well, although it is entirely likely
that they're better than nothing as far as as the subject is concerned.
The problem with current AA methods is that they further discrimination
in the job/marketplace because (among other things) they give the
bigots an EXCUSE to continue discriminating.  <They also create
dangerous situations for people, crime, assault, and a lot of
other bad things, but it's not clear that the amount created
is less than the amount prevented.>
The message?  TEACH, and hold people responsible for their
own actions.  If it is shown that race or sex is an issue
in a given situation, punish the person/persons directly responsible,
not the current employees.
Above all, DON'T GIVE THE PREVIOUS ""PRIVLEDGED"" CLASS A SENSE
OF HOPELESSNESS.    To do so only creates hate, and a new class
of unhappy people (who, given the power that they DO hold,
will ensure that nobody winds up happy.)
Remember.  If you kick someone who doesn't deserve it, they will
become your enemy.  If you work with that person to a solution
satisfactory to both, you have gained an ally.  (If you kick
a person who has deliberately hurt you, that's another story.)
Any system that PRESUMES guilt (as AA does, in practice)
is kicking those who don't deserve it along with those
who do.  Who needs more enemies?

>Brad Templeton, Looking Glass Software Ltd. - Waterloo, Ontario 
519/884-7473
Allow me to suggest at least one reason why there are more qualified men 
than women in engineering (if not other 'technical' fields):
At the University of Waterloo (where I spent my undergraduate years in
computer science and \not/ engineering), there were a number of things
which filtered out to the rest of the campus from the Engineering wing
of things:
 1) The Engineering Society (EngSoc) sponsored a ""humour"" paper for
    engineers (the ""EngiNews""). It was apparently quite crude, rude,
    and sexist in its ""humour"".  In other university papers, there was
    a steady barrage of complaints about the sexism of the ""EngiNews"",
    as well as a steady stream of replies saying that those complaining
    weren't engineers and shouldn't be reading the paper anyways.  A few
    years ago, a woman who worked for the company which printed the paper
    refused to work on printing an issue which she found particularly
    offensive. (Note:  She was fired because of this.)
 2) About 2 years ago, the engineers had a Lady Godiva day.  (Lady
    Godiva is the ""mascot"" of engineers.)  An officially sponsored
    (by EngSoc) event was a Lady Godiva march - a stripper was hired
    to parade with several hundred engineers all over the campus, wearing
    nothing but an overcoat.  At various stops, she would ""tittilate"" people
    by opening her overcoat.  At one point, the march invaded an exam room
    disturbing an exam in progress.  When the parade was condemned by many,
    EngSoc made a back-handed apology in a student newspaper (i.e. - We're
    sorry if we offended anyone, but we feel we had the right to.)  Other
    than a small handslap from the university (a statement condemning the
    march), there was no visible action taken.
 3) There was a game called ""Cobra"", I believe, which required a female
    engineer. It was played at any time there was a group of male engineers
    and a female engineer.  One (male) engineer would cry out ""Cobra!"",
    and then all the (male) engineers would quickly try to bite the back-side
    of the female engineer.
 4) EngSoc sponsored events tended to be Bus Pushes, Arm Wrestling
    competitions, etc;  events which tend to require ""physical prowess""
    (read ""male-oriented"". Men seem to need to show off their strength;
    women don't.)
These blatant examples of sexism are in one technical discipline at one
university, but rest assured that sexism is not limited to just there --
it's just more obvious.  Rest assured, also, that the images portrayed
by technical fields such as engineering are extremely unappealing to women.
(Would you want to be on the receiving end in a game of ""Cobra""?)
Until these technical fields get rid of their male-engendered,
unappealing-to-women images, and the inherent sexism is gotten rid of,
it's ridiculous to speculate that something such as genetics is responsible
for the imbalance in the ratio of men to women in said technical fields.

Government, and its publicly owned subsidiaries, because they are 
intrinsically monopolies, have no right to discriminate, since everyone
ends up paying taxes, in one form or another, to support the government.
In addition, the monopoly nature of government means that if they are
discriminating foolishly, there is no alternate business to patronize
and make rich.  Private companies that discriminate (unless a *substantial*
part of the population agrees with them) with be uncompetitive with
non-discriminatory companies; this is why governments around the world
have usually *required* discrimination of private employers --- South
Africa being a good example.
If an employer doesn't have the right to make decisions as to who
will be hired, why do you have to right to discriminate in who you
have sex with?  Isn't it ""unfair"" that you aren't an equal opportunity
sexual partner?  Why should homosexuals (especially S&M types) be
treated so badly by you?  What makes sexual relations any more private
than business relations?  In both cases, you are deciding who you are
going to associate with in a transaction that involves both of you.
If you want to argue that business transactions affect our whole
society: congratulations, that's what people who support anti-homosexuality
laws argue.  They claim the effects of what consenting adults do in
private (which is what employment is) lower the moral tone and character
of the society as a whole.  Why don't you accept that there are some
things that the government has no right to interfere with?  If you
don't, you are making it easier for the people that would put a 
camera in every bedroom.

Come on now Beth!!
The reason that the majority of players on the pro Basketball teams are
black is probably that during tryouts, they were better than the other
players. Chances are good that some other race guys tried out for the
team also. They just weren't good enough.
Now you are willing to have less exciting games, with less qualified
people for the sake of AA!!!  Let me guess: you'd rather go to a less
qualified doctor or lawyer or computer programmer that really isn't
up to snuff, but is the right <sex , race>???

Perhaps you are using ""rascism"" to mean something different than Clayton
is.  The point is not that AA is ""rascist,"" but that it is wrong for
the government to promote the interests of a particular racial group
(whether or not you choose to call such promotion ""rascism"").

And AA promotes it.
	(yeah, cheap shot, but I couldn't resist)

	Again, the 'well-off white males' make up a *very* small part
of the population (well, it depends how you define 'well-off';  I assume
you mean wealthy).

	I disagree strongly with your last point.  If you kill murderers,
it is still murder.  If you rape rapists, it is still rape.  If you pursue
racist policies against racists, it is still racism.  'The ends justifies
the means' is the argument that such things are justified, and has justified
some of the most atrocious things.  What state of mind could 'generate that
kind of rhetoric'?  A contemplative state of mind that examines what is
being said.

My own observations have shown the opposite.  Besides, it takes time
for people to move up the corporate ladder.  This by itself can explain
why there are fewer women in higher levels of business.  After all,
for example, til about 15 years ago (or was it 25?) IBM fired women
when they got married.
Even if discrimination COMPLETELY disappeared tomorrow morning, it doesn't
mean that 51% of all management would be women by the evening, or next week,
or next year, or even next decade.  Such movement does NOT happen overnight.
But, it IS getting better here.

I don't think it is ""too slowly"".  Equal access provisions (which I support)
and individual/group striving are fine and ARE working.  Pretty quickly
too when you consider how long major social restructuring usually takes.  
AA goes beyond this and tries to impose changes unrealistically fast.  
Yes, I know about slavery.  It IS something that can be eliminated quickly.
But stuffing management with the same proportions as the population,
where many of the groups do NOT have appropriate qualifications (yet) just
ends up destroying the viability of many companies, and inciting
hostility with those people who are qualified but passed over.
Sure there are lots of studies that show some group is not yet proportionally
represented in some sector of the workplace.  We just had a study done
on women in the media that showed that they aren't close to full
representation.  But, 20 years ago there weren't ANY women in the media.
20 years from now it will probably be really close to fair representation
(without AA).  Trying to force ""fair"" representation this instant, when
the group does not have a ""tradition"" in a particular sector (so
that proportionate numbers of the group are choosing to enter the sector)
is unfair to those who have.  Besides, would you want to force quotas
on areas that are disproportionate by nature?  (eg: modelling men's 
underwear, hockey or football teams).  Equal access provides the protection
that people are not discriminated against with non-job-related factors.
That's sufficient AND fair to everybody.

	How does one measure ""striving""?  How does the government determine
if XYZ Corp. is ""striving"" enough, and in the right directions? 
	This perception is specious.  Law must be explicit, objective, and
measurable.  Otherwise, there is no way that the citizenry can ever be
sure it is complying, nor can enforcement and judiciary ever determine
compliance.  Laws that require ""striving"" are unmeasurable and unenforceable.
	Therfore, regardless of the intent or wording of Affirmative Action
statutes, compliance is still measured by head counts - and that means
counting race and sex as compliance criteria - de facto racism/sexism.

Judging from this description, Waterloo sounds, er, ""unusual"".
Bus pushing contests don't sounds like the sort of thing a ""typical""
engineer would be interested in.  Most engineers' talents lie in the
brain, not in the biceps.
The ""Lady Godiva Day"" sounds like standard college foolishness.
If you don't want to be around college foolishness, don't go
to college.
The ""humour"" paper sounds like the sort of garbage lower life forms
tend to enjoy.  I'm not sure what Canada's position is on ""freedom
of the press"", but this sort of paper would be rather hard to
outlaw in the US without lots of people yelling about the first
admendment.  We may not like it, but we seem to be stuck with it,
least we give the book-burners a free reign.  :-(
The ""cobra"" game sounds like something which needs to be stomped
on, hard.  This sort of thing is inexcusable.
Yes, it sounds like the Waterloo engineering dept is full of low-life,
sexist slimeballs.  Don't assume that this applies to engineers in
general.

OOOOHHHHH!  Pass the gas!  Matches!
First, the bus push is a fund raising effort for charity.  Sort of a walkathon
for people with a difference.
Secondly,  the Waterloo engineering department (faculty and staff) are
definately not in favour of some of the &))(&&*() stunts the so called

Lastly,  I seem to recall some incidents that some Purdue students pulled a

    ANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WHATSOEVER that is aimed at helping our

    in the form of subsidies to black entrepreneurs, economic aid for women
    students, or free milk programs native american elementary school

It's offensive to most netters when someone attributes to them
beliefs and attitudes that they didn't express.  Cramer's response is
just mud-slinging, like his repeated statements that affirmative
action is ""racism.""  To patronize means to treat with a manner or air
of condescending notice.  What I stated above was that my knowledge
of a person's race or sex can influence my actions toward them.  (The
same is true of everyone reading this:  I doubt that many netters are
sex-blind in their dating and sex life.)  Nothing in this implies
condescension or a superior attitude.  Is it condescending to be
aware, as most of us are, that any woman or black in the US, merely
because he or she is black or female, is the object of some deeply
rooted prejudices and discriminatory practices, and that this is a
significant fact in the lives of most of them?  Cramer seems to say
that if we let this awareness influence our actions IN ANY WAY, we
are guilty of patronizing and taking an attitude of superiority to
blacks and females.  Perhaps the safest thing to do, on this view, is
simply to forget that blacks and women suffer from racism and sexism
-- otherwise we are on a slippery slope that leads through
condescension to the horrors of ""reverse discrimination.""
What does Cramer mean by the phrase ""treat everyone as an
individual""?  Or is this just a question we're not supposed to ask?
I've been going around today trying to mend my ways and ""treat
everyone as an individual,"" but I'm damned if I know what to do.

Congratulations!  You ARE the perfect person.  Now, us mere mortals
who are honest enough to admit it realize that we are all prejudiced.
We may rationalize our biases (as a racist does), pretend our biases
don't exist (the ""who, me?"" bigot), or try to correct or surpress
them.  Pretending they don't exist makes them more potent.
Now maybe you do treat EVERYONE as an individual ALL the time; for me
(and those such as Carnes who are honest enough to understand their own
feelings), justness is something that must be striven for.  Frankly,
those who err and atone are far more credible than those who claim
never to have erred at all.
Now if you only would treat Carnes as an individual and stop rushing
to apply a label to him so you can treat him as part of some group...

""Patronizing"" may not be the appropriate term, but what you said implies
that you treat women differently because they have been oppressed.  I
suspect there are other reasons you treat women differently, as you say:
""I doubt that many netters are sex-blind in their dating and sex life.""
It is clear that this is not what Clayton was talking about.

I believe he means that people should be treated according to their

Mr. Carnes, you assume that every black or woman in the US has been

you a lesson in sociology and anthropology.  But I have been reading the
net discussion about the affirmative action issue and feel that I should
give you some insight.
	I am a light-skinned, Hispanic-sur-named black.  I grew up in
Massachusetts communities that were predominantly (more than 98%)
non-colored.  They had, because it was important to my parents, good
school systems.  I received a good education, attended the state
university, graduated and served as an officer in the Navy.  After some
years in graduate school, I entered the civilian working world.
	During my school and service years, I had encountered some adverse
racial discrimination but it was rarely blatant enough to stir me to
react.  I tended to consider it ignorance and let it pass.  At the time
that civil rights leaders (and other voices) were looking for an
affirmative action law or laws, I felt that equal access guarantees were
sufficient.  I no longer believe this.  Here is why.
	Sex- and race-biased imbalances in the workplace are not accidental
nor unconscious.  They are, in fact, the result of very deliberate
selective hiring practices (you could call it ""the principle of hiring
for similarity"").  It is a set of practices grounded in a kind of
thinking which most of us, at one time or another, have been guilty.
The thinking I speak of is the rationalization that there will be
greater harmony (and therefore productivity, I assume) in the workplace
if the members share similar backgrounds and culture.  For centuries,
this type of hiring was practiced without question.
	In American society, we are faced by facts that compel a different
approach.  There are some factors that, by the old standards, would
perpetually exclude some members of society from most workplaces (if
only on the basis of tradition).  The two most notable -- although
certainly not most important -- are a person's sex or race.  Like the
protagonist in Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"", women, blacks, Hispanics
and other visually recognizable minorities were considered blanketly
incapable of doing the functions of the white male business majority.
In fact, a survey of Massachusetts corporate boards recently seemed to
indicate that this attitude is far from dead.
	I have been a victim of such attitudes, treated like an ""invisible""
person, and my career opportunity has been narrow.  I am different.  But
the differences that have made my professional life more difficult than
normal have not been differences of qualifications or aptitude.  There
are differences of style, presentation, and of relationship.  They are
the kinds of differences which, if accepted and utilized in the American
workplace over the last decades, would have resulted in a much different
picture in the comparative successes in the international marketplaces.
They are the differences that simply request that individuals not assume
that their place in the world is their right due to their maleness,
whiteness, or American-ness.  What I am saying is that many people, some
probably without even realizing it, sincerely believe that they have
been born with some kind of superiority.
	The courts and lawmakers of the past two decades agreed broadly
that the kind of exclusory discrimination described above had occurred
and that it should be halted and corrected as soon as possible.  Their
conclusion was that active adjustments should be encouraged and, where
possible, directed.  They saw then, as I do now, that the problem was a
deep seated one, and that passive approaches would have little effect on
making actual changes in hiring and promotion practice.  They fully
understood that change required actually having minorities working in
positions from which ""tradition"" had perennially barred them.  Further,
they knew that from the point of strictest ""fairness,"" affirmative
action would for a time create its own form of discrimination.  However,
in the long term a policy actively pursuing true employment equality
could accomplish in fact a long denied constitutional principle.
	It was to this end that today's affirmative action laws and programs
were created.   The intent (and effect, in most cases) of the laws is to
create a dynamic process that actively begins a change.  Without such
laws, it would be too easy for an employer so disposed to shrug off a
minority job candidate by saying ""Not qualified"" or ""No _____s or ____n
applied.""  Affirmative action applies the pressure to find and promote
persons who, in the past, had no recourse is cases of job or promotional
rejection.  As minority workers increase their presence in the
workplace, as they are accepted as fully contributing members of th
professions, are promoted and themselves assume the power of hiring, the
need to actively enforce minority hiring should diminish.
	Consider that it has been one hundred and twenty years since the
freeing of the majority of American blacks and sixty-odd years since
women won the right to vote.  If the issue of workplace equality were to
follow its course simply by ""equal opportunity"" policy, can anyone
predict at what time in the future minorities could widely claim a
reasonable share the workplace pie.  It is, to me, unfortunate that laws
must be passed to compel people to do what seems just, fair, and
beneficial (to say nothing of being common sense).  That is the reality
of American society, however, and our own law -- the Constitution --
says that equality of human kind is a basic tenet of our national
beliefs.  People talk about morality a lot these days.  The Constitution
is our stated moral guide, it seems to me, and if we are not up to
taking action to bring such dreams to pass what are our *real* goals for
democracy?","1H-ndcLWresJ",18,1985-06-18,12,1

I frankly admit to being instinctually prejudiced (prejudice does NOT
neceassarily imply racism or any other ism; see below).  I am aware of
this, and endeavor to firmly surpress it.
W. H. Auden once said something to the effect that all Christians 
possessed anti-Semitic feelings, but the tragedy was that so few of them
were ashamed of it.  It is my firm belief that ALL of us tend to
prejudge those who are ""like"" us in a better manner than those who are
""unlike"", and I am shamed by my frailty.  However, knowledge must
precede shame.

If Carnes is a racist or sexist, than we all are.  There is a grave
leap from acknowledged prejudice (what Carnes is guilty of) to the
adoption of the intellectual belief in the inferiority of another race
or sex.  Your haste to blur that distinction appears to me an attempt
to prejudge Carnes.  If you were to acknowledge your own human 
tendency to prejudge, you might have first determined Carnes's motives
and his reaction to his own prejudice before you began attempting
application of scarlet letters.

Absolutely true.  Let me give an example from my real-world experience:
Back in the early '70s I was working for the Los Angeles  County  Engineer,
Aviation  Division.  At  that  time, _all_ airport attendants were male, by
Division policy.  Then the  Board  of  Supervisors  handed  down  an  edict
prohibiting sexual discrimination in hiring practices ...
You wouldn't have believed the  confusion.  Two  division  chiefs  and  six
airport  managers  were  running around for weeks trying to figure a way to
legally _not_ comply with the edict.  They asked _everyone_,  including  me
and some of the (female) secretaries(!), to dream up excuses for them.
Typical excuse:  ""There aren't any women's showers at the airports.""
Pretty lame, right?  Well, they used it.
Note that we're not talking  about  a  highly  skilled  position  here.  An
airport  attendant  was  a  not-very-glorified gas pump jockey.  In between
fueling planes, they'd weed the median  strips  and  perform  miscellaneous
janitorial  tasks.  Not what you'd call Doctorate level stuff.  Nor did the
job call for great physical strength.
If this goes on in the Civil  Service,  imagine  what  happens  in  private
business.

May I just interject a word into this interesting discussion of my
psychology.  No one said anything about kid gloves.  The point is
that ethnic group or sex is a significant datum about an individual.
Ask a woman or black or Hispanic whether they ever think about being
female or black or Hispanic.  Does it ever cross their minds, do you
suppose?  If so, why should it not cross our minds, and even
influence our actions?
While I'm at it I would like to object once more to the use of the
terms racism and sexism to mean simply prejudice or ""thinking of
people as groups"" or whatever is the favorite usage of the deep
thinkers at National Review or The Wall Street Journal.  Loose talk
is generally an index of loose thinking.  Many blacks in the US are
for understandable reasons prejudiced against whites -- that's why I
am not given to taking casual strolls through many areas of Chicago's
South Side.  But I have never heard of a black racist in the US,
unless there have been blacks who shared the beliefs of white
racists.  Racism is the belief, held by many honorable and sincere
men such as David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, G.W.F. Hegel, and Louis
Agassiz, that one ethnic group is ""by nature"" inferior, morally or
intellectually, to another.  This was ""respectable"" opinion among
many whites in the 19th century.  The scientific evidence for this
belief is nonexistent.

they worked to shape their environments into their image of

Today's young, professional straight couples actually have a lot in common

If the gays pioneered a yuppie lifestyle, perhaps AIDS is living
proof that gay's ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" attitude
eventually WILL lead to their destruction, just as a yuppie
lifestyle woven only of materialism (and NOT sexually transmitted
lethal diseases) leads to a society devoid of spiritual consciousness.
Another problem is differentiating between yuppies and preppies.
Not an important problem, mind net, but a problem nonetheless.
Sure, bermudas from Beans can be construed as prep, but do they
wreak of yuppie? Somehow prep is more of a socially accepted
term, and yuppie is definitely derogative.

Maybe I'm just a little slow today.  Would you care to rephrase
this argument in two or more sentences?  That way I can attempt to
follow what appears to be, in this form, a completely disjointed
morass of sanctimonious assertions.
On a different note, I'd be interested if someone could tell me
where the term ""yuppie"" originated (i.e. who first used it?  Time
Magazine or the like?)  The first time I remember hearing it was
on a Mark Russell comedy special a couple of years ago.

Now that you ask, I can't figure out what he's saying either.  But when
I first read the original article, I read perhaps the first two lines
of the paragraph before deciding that the rest probably wasn't worth

6th.  It's addressed to all voters who think they may vote for Reagan,
but especially to closet Republicans, [Ll]ibertarians, and gay people.
(The views expressed herein are my own, & not those of my employer.)
To my mind the foremost reason for not reinstating Ronnie is his
inveterate homophobia.  I wish to dissuade voters who entertain
any of the following notions:
1) Reagan is personally a Nice Guy, free of prejudice himself, but
   politically allied with conspicuous homophobes, whom he ignores
   or tries to contain;
2) Reagan's a bigot, but also a staunch defender of privacy and
   unhampered free enterprise; this, say Libertarians, makes
   civil rights laws redundant & unnecessary (& obnoxious);
3) Reagan is a nasty idiot, who can't tell an ""individual right""
   from a hole-in-the-wall, but the direction or EFFECT of his
   administration is beneficial.  No matter how dreadful specific
   Reagan policies, programs, or appointees are, a net good must
   result.
In defense of 1)-3), one could cite two actions:
-- In 1978, in his newspaper column, Reagan was the first major
   California politician to publically oppose the Briggs Initia-
   tive (which would have allowed local school boards to dismiss
   teachers ""advocating sexual lifestyle"", a phrase which was left
   undefined).  Reagan was out of office then, with no constituents
   to answer to; opposition to the Initiative didn't necessarily
   imply tolerance, but rather a desire not to undercut teachers' 
   authority & most educational and teachers' organizations had 
   already come out publically against the initiative (with an
   eye to his political future, Reagan may've wished to conciliate(?)
   California educators, whom he'd utterly alienated as governor
   by making godawful John Bircher Max Rafferty education czar).
-- It is said (this isn't more than a rather pious rumor) that Reagan
   helped to kill Roger Jepsen's bizarre Family Protection Act by in-
   action, etc.
(A third matter, Terry Dolan's giving THE ADVOCATE, a gay biweekly, 
an interview 2 years ago, for which he caught a lot of flak from 
other Reagan supporters, is in the realm of PR, a pretty shaky 
basis for a belief in Reagan's tolerance).
The truth is that appeal to antihomosexual bigotry has been a staple
of Reagan's political career from its very outset.  In 1967 he cam-
paigned for governor of California largely by obsessively charging
that the University of California at Berkeley was a ""hotbed of homo-
sexuality & communism"".  This ""queer smear"" derived entirely from a
nonviolent & rather minor campus controversy:  the editor-in-chief of
the undergraduate paper, The Daily Califorian, had published a series
of articles on homosexuals in the Bay Area.  The series was done in
an objective, social-scientific vein (the editor was a sociology major).
University regents, as timid as ever, ousted him from the editorship,
but the student senate (I think) reinstated him.  Big deal.  Apparently
Reagan thought it was, especially for his political ambitions: he won 
the election.
In 1967 no New Right existed, and the far right had virtually no power
or influence, even locally.  Reagan could not have then been the poli-
tical captive of militantly homophobic supporters.  Altho' fagbaiting
is a venerable tradition in American politics, usually employed in the
desperate final days of a losing campaign to slander opponents by innu-
endo, few politicians have made the blatant, indiscriminate, repeated,
& lengthy use of it that Ronald Reagan has.

What gives any belief system (or any group of adherents to a belief
system) the right to ""denormalize""/outlaw/prohibit any set of behaviors
that doesn't interfere with or harm other human beings?  If anybody
has that ""right"" now, it's a right worth taking away.

If the prison system had the means to truly psychologically rehabilitate
rapists/murderers/ALL those who feel they have some sort of right to
interfere in other people's lives, then ""protection"" for such
rehabilitated people would be warranted, NOT to allow them to re-engage
in their anti-human activities, but rather to live their lives in peace.
What anti-human activities are homosexuals guilty of?  (By the way, I
thought ""gay"" was used not to make things more ""palatable"" for those
like you---it hasn't and it won't---but rather as a self-descriptive term
to provide a positive self-image for gay people, as opposed to the malicious
and/or more clinical terms.)

Let's also be sure to make sure that anything else that we ""just don't
like"" is also not considered by ""society"" to be ""a normal sort of thing"".

I assume the author is referring to his own vindictive arbitrary hatred.
Disgust is in the eye of the beholder.  What give such beholders the right
to impose behavior standards on beholdees?  And, if nature is ""what happens
in the real world"", how can anything that actually happens be a perversion
of nature?  Or are only one person's specific views on what is ""natural"" the
basis for guidelines?

Yes, I do.  But that is not enough.  Some religious groups oppose
dancing, Christmas trees, drinking any alcohol, etc ....  And
I assume it is their Covenant with God to choose not to do these
things, which is their Constitiutionally protected right which I,

However, you do not have the right to keep me from dancing, setting

No, your analogy fails here.  A rapist physically violates the
security of another human being without their consent.  Homosexual
activity is done with the consent of the parties envolved (NB: if
it isn't done with consent that's rape, too, and should be punished
accordingly).
In California, the Legislature has decided that sexual acts between
consenting adults (of unspecified gender) are not illegal.  I suspect
other states have passed similar laws.

No argument from me here.  (Homosexuals have plenty to worry about

I'm glad you will not discriminate in the workplace on this issue.
But you aren't asked to consider this sort of thing as normal.  You
aren't even asked to like it.  The only thing reasonably expected
from you is to live in harmony with others, and to be tolerant of
those who are different from you, that's all.  I'm sure you'd
want the same treatment, no?

OK, let's say it is.  Let's say that picking my nose is a disgusting
act of perversion of nature.  Whatever.  That's your choice to see it
that way.  You don't have to like that, either.  But at least allow
other people to be different from you.
If you can show me how you feel that homosexuality hurts you personally
I'd like to dicuss that, too.

	Milo, I don't follow what you're saying here.  Racism is
discrimiation against someone on the basis of his/her skin color
or national origin.  Homosexuality is not discrimination, unless
you claim that I am discriminating against a straight woman by
not going to bed with her.  :-)

	First, I would much rather do my own thinking than have
God do my thinking for me.
	Second, if people have the freedom to do what they want,
why are you so concerned about what they do?  As long as they are
not trying to force their views upon you, they should be free to
do as they wish.  As a gay male, and as a person of color, I
don't believe that because I am gay (or Black), I have a 'right'
to certain things.  However, I do believe that as an American, I
have a 'right' to freedom of association, job opportunity, etc.
	Finally, I invite you to elaborate on the 'societal
impact' of not viewing homosexuality as a sin.
	Oh yeah, almost forgot.  I plan to vote for Reagan.

        I have to disagree with your last  statement.  There
are instances where homosexual activity has been observed in
the  animal  kingdom.   There  were  some  articles  in  net
religion  about  it  last year.  I am trying to look them up
for you.  My real point, however, is that it does happen  in
animals  as  well  as people.  If that be the case, then you
cannot call it a ""perversion of nature.""

Mr. Medin would seem to be hoist upon his own petard.
On the one hand, he rants and raves about the need for
""rationality"" and hard, scientific data on various claims
that are made about the destructive capabilities of nuclear
weapons. Yet, he seems to have no inhibitions, whatsoever,
against claiming factual status for his own, unsupported 
speculations about the factors that determine sexual orientation.
Where is the scientific data, the ""numbers""  that back  up
Mr. Medin's  assertions?  Or are we to fall  back upon  
""God's laws"" for the rationale here?

Rich, I think you're a little confused here.
I'm surprised you haven't heard about the small sect of Californians
who consider being gay to be of high religious significance.
Their fight against the normalization procedure is simply to 
preserve purity of form.  The only problem that I can see with this
is that their views become so introverted that they lose the part
of their brains' that are used for spelling and grammar.

Rich, I think you've missed the point.
The point Milo makes about convicted rapists clearly and convincingly
proves that special rehabilitation centers should be established for
gays.  That is why we have begun the Discipline Center for Correct
Thought.  Our first location will be in San Francisco.  What's more,
the term gay simply came from the creators being 'a'ltered g'u'ys;
thus 'gays'.  I'm sure Milo knew this.

Who said anything about forcing anyone to hire homosexuals?  There can't

merely requires the services of an employee.

some pictures that apparently were calculated to shock the audience.
It seems a pity that people should be misled by zealots of this kind.
One of the most dramatic results of Denmark's complete legalization
of pornography was a reduction of 67% in the rate of child molestation.
(Other sex crimes were apparently reduced sharply, but perhaps not
to as large an extent, whereas rape was hardly affected at all). Some
writers have claimed that the reduction in sex crime statistics is the
result of a reduction in reporting sex crimes.  It seems unlikely that
a reduction of 2/3 in child molestation could be attributed to sudden
under-reporting.
I have sent this to net.women and net.politics because it seems to me
to be a political issue, but one that women's groups (in Canada, anyway)

against women.  Instead, the official women's groups seem to be arguing
the other way, which I have never understood.

also in the United States) are not for pornography, but rather are
against it.
The reason is quite simple.  Pornography, which is almost
exclusively directed towards men, depicts women purely and simply as
sex objects.  One glance at the ""split beaver"" shots in (say)
Hustler would convince you of this.  Moreover, much of pornography
depicts women as subservient and abused by men.  With this in mind,
is it any wonder that many women, I'm sure even Phyllis Schlafly,
oppose pornography.

where a (male, for the record) researcher showed male college
students some pornographic films, and then three days later gave
them and a control group a survey that covered additudes about women
and about violence towards women.  
The young men who saw the films were 1/3 more likely to condone
violence against women, and also, 1/3 more of them said that THEY
PERSONALLY might commit violence against women if they knew they
wouldn't be caught.  
The films showed portrayed women as enjoying violent acts against
themselves.
I wish I could find my reference.  It was reported in the Daily
Oregonian on Tuesday, Jan 30, 1984.
There was more to the article, but this is all I remember clearly
enough to paraphrase.  Other items dealt with the (as I recall,
rather large) portion of the male population of <US? Canada?> that might
commit violence aginst women if they knew they wouldn't get caught,
and the researcher's problems at being taken seriously ,initially,
by the research community.
So, there IS research showing that pornography is harmful to women,
in that it is harmful to male additudes towards women.  Also, don't
you think that it may be harmful to growing girls to see that they
are supposed to enjoy pain to be attractive?  That is, to attract
the attention of men and boys that pornographic models seem to attract.
A Definition:
Pornography is that which depicts people enjoying pain and
mistreatment.  Also, that which celebrates violence as a valid form
of sexuality.

be eliminated  by any means consistent with civil liberties restraints.
================
Logically, you are right.  But child molestation was not the only
sex-related crime to be dramatically reduced when pornography was
legalized.  It is logically possible that the simultaneous reductions
were all due to some other cause, but rationally unlikely.  The only
crime sometimes called sex-related that did not decrease much was rape,
and many people have argued that rape is not really a sex crime anyway.
The second point is about violence in pornography.  Why is it apparently
increasing in N. American pornography (but not in countries where
pornography is legal in Europe)?  I have two suspicions about this.
One is that the illegality of pornography leaves it in the hands of
criminals to whom violence is a natural way of life.  They like what
they publish, and it sells.  Second guess is that it relates to the
general US love of violence, as expressed on TV.  It sells there, too.
I'd be very happy with a campaign to reduce the level of violence in
TV, but I suspect that there would remain a generation who think the
solution to most problems is to beat someone (some nation) up.

Well, John, maybe the porn *you* read depicts women as being subservient
and abused.  Try something more respectable, like Penthouse.  And what,
I'd like to know, is wrong with appreciating the sexual attractiveness
of another human being (or, as they say at the Naperville Anti-Smut

This has a lot of merit.  How about if we define pornography as above,
and define ""smut"" to be naughty pictures.  In that case, I am violently
anti-pornography and rabidly pro-smut.

hard to swallow.  I have no argument with the assertion that much
pornography is sexually exploitative, reduces women to the status of
objects, and contains a great deal of (sometimes) barely-concealed
hatred and violence against women.  (I might add that a smaller but
significant amount of pornography is equally exploitative of men, but
since two wrongs don't make a right, that may be a moot point.)  When
it comes to arguing on the basis of the above that pornography should
be outlawed, however, I couldn't disagree more.
I have what some may consider to be a radical view on freedom of the
press, namely that the restriction of expression is ultimately much
more dangerous to society than the material which we might like to
restrict.  There is much that appears every day in the newspapers,
magazine racks, bookstores, movie theaters and airwaves which I find
unpleasant, offensive, or even dangerous; nevertheless, I would prefer
to see the crap flow freely than to see any individual or group given
the power to decide what is crap and what is not.  This applies just as
much to pornography as to anything else.  The only valid exceptions I
see to an absolute right to freedom of expression are slander, libel,
false advertising and copyright laws.
One obvious problem with the radical feminists' stance on pornography
is that one person's smut is another person's beautiful erotica or
educational work.  When I moved away from Oklahoma six years ago, they
were still jailing bookstore owners for selling ""The Joy of Sex"", and
in some parts of the country much worse things have happened since.  I
don't think that many feminists would call Alex Comfort an oppressor of
women, but what the anti-pornographers don't seem to realize is that
the power to censor, once established, will not be used according to
their criteria of what is wholesome and what is exploitative.  Today
""Hustler"" might disappear from the newsstands; tomorrow Anais Nin and
books on birth control will be banned; the next day the feminists may
wake up to find their own writings being confiscated, sexual or not.
I think that a much healthier response to the whole issue has been made
by those feminists who have refused to retreat to a neo-puritanical
stand on pornography, instead realizing that the erotic has at least as
strong a capacity for beauty as it does for violence and inhumanity.
Real progress will be made not by closing theaters and burning
magazines but by producing works of art which appeal to the sexual
impulses of women and men without pandering to hatred or turning anyone
into a faceless object.

===========
Isn't this a re-definition rather than a definition?  It is certainly not
the definition of what is sold in pornography shops where porn is legal.
The whole debate about pornography has been turned around by this emphasis
on violence.  Violence has no place in pornography, any more than bathtub
gin (prohibition-induced) belongs in a wine cellar.  Why is there so much
violence in N. American pornography that people are beginning to think
that violence is a core component of it?  Isn't it probable that Prohibition
is one cause, and the US penchant for violence in most entertainment
another cause?  It is quite wrong and misleading to use the fact that
exposure to violence desensitizes the viewers as an argument against
pornography.  It should be used as an argument against the portrayal of
violence, a fight that has been going on a long time with no apparent
result.
I suspect that the sexual nature of pornography is the reason people
really want it suppressed, and they use the intrusion of violence as
an excuse to legitimate their views.

I really not trying to make an example out of Mike Leibensperger,

I've looked at Penthouse; heck, I've *bought* Penthouse in the past.
They have good interviews, and occasionally good articles and fiction.
And lots of pictures of very nice-looking women in various uncomfortable-
looking poses, with genitals or breasts exposed.  And I once looked at these
pictures quite a bit.  Eventually they became familiar, and lost their
erotic effect.  And as the fog of desire lifted, I began to see the
person in the pictures.  (Sounds a bit corny, I know, but I think it
describes pretty much how I felt.)  The women's faces and postures began
to look fearful or submissive.  Their eyes were usually adverted, except
when their posture showed exaggerated submission.  Or the pictures seemed
purely voyeurisic, with the woman unaware of the camera.  And it began
to dawn on me that the feminist accusations against men's magazines
were *true*.  These women were presented as objects to be used, and
not as lovers/friends/people.  There is a difference between sexual
desire and wanting someone as an object for sexual use.
(I might mention that voyeurism--watching a person in a vulnerable
state without being vulnerable yourself--is a power-trip.  In a way,
it is *forcing* a person to submit to your desire to look, as they have
no control over it.  Thus, I might find *more* redeeming features in
more hard-core materials than Penthouse if there were less a sense of
intrusion and the portrayal wasn't weighted down with stereotypes or
dominance.)
If you still aren't convinced that Penthouse puts down women, just read
some of the sex fantasies in their `Forum' section.  Study the vocabulary
a bit.  Sexual intercourse is an act of force, even of pain, in a lot of
these.  And some of them are a lot more blatant; I remember one in which
a man tells of turning his wife into a sex-slave--the acts described
(which I won't go into here) were so criminal as to be worthy of a life
sentence in many states.  Yet there was no note of this fact; just a
glowing report of how nice this man's life has become with his new
`pet'.
Needless to say, I no longer buy Penthouse (or any other magazine of
its ilk).  Censorship?  I'm a civil libertarian; besides, I consider
these magazines to be a symptom, not a cause.  But I obviously won't
heasitate to tell people what I think these magazines really are.

I simply can't agree.  I don't particularly want to defend Penthouse,
since I consider it very sleazy, but I have read as many letters from
women (in the Forum) describing how they turned their men into
sex slaves as from men.  I also don't see how you can say that the
camera is spying on someone who is outside on a public beach with no
clothes on (a very common pose in Penthouse).  I think you may have
been casting some of your own feelings onto the pictures to get
the interpretations you came up with.

I'll agree that the beach pictures were usually pretty harmless, but
I don't remember many of them.  And even indoor shots had exceptions,
some of which were tasteful and even erotic without voyeurism or
debasement.  But just because something is absent on some occasions
doesn't mean it isn't there at all.
And, yes, I read some of my feelings into the images, but no more than
in looking at, say, a LIFE magazine photo.  That was the point of my
original article--as soon as I began looking at the pictures for what
they were (photographs of obviously posed individuals, with careful
attention to staging and costume), rather than whatever they pretended
to be, the *intellectual* connection was made.  Try it yourself; ask
yourself just what statement is being made about the individual in the
photograph.  Sometimes--maybe not even half the time, but certainly
often--you'll see the message I described.
Advocating slavery or abuse of either sex is hardly right, and doing
so under the guise of sexual liberation only makes it more wrong.  Of
course, the fact that the `letters' are fictional doesn't detract from
this--in fact, it changes their status from the presentation of reader
opinion into a form of advocacy.
But I'll repeat that I strongly oppose censorship, or the banning of
pornography.  And I'm no prude, either (references available upon
request :-)  ).

What Gary was (and is) saying is that such meetings deserve some special

Christianity, that's different, eh?  Again, your goal was to claim that

Ah, but science leads to conclusions like evolution, and the skepticism

They are part of what the religionists seek to abolish.  After all, how

I meant to type ""anti-humanist"", and what's more I think you're fully

it, such people, when they proclaim that that word of god (as they see it)

That was light.  A light that needs to be cast on the real reasons behind

Indeed.  And Samuelson thinks faith must be right.  It is not a faith

Better referred to as ""wishful thinking"", to be sure.  When you base your
judgments of the way you perceive the world to be on ""what you hope for"",
you are deliberating failing to be objective, and clouding your conclusions.
Which is OK (or not) depending on your goals.  If you're not looking for

As seen in Samuelson's summart of his own original article, the only ""fair""
hearing in his view would be one that holds Christianity up as the absolute
truth.  After all, any other ""hearing"" would show flaws in it, and he certainly
doesn't want THAT.

And with good reason:  they have taught them a biased and bogus set of
beliefs contrary to real reality.  Not just *different* from ""norms"" (as
with customs of ethnic groups), contrary to reality.  Indeed, I ""revel"" (maybe
too strong a word, perhaps ""be pleased to see"") in religion dying out
from disuse.  I have repeatedly said that it is not my wish to forcefully
eradicate religion.  To do so would make us no better than they are.
To let it drop dead of its own weight as more and more people are
informed, would certainly prove better.  Of course, it is possible
that dispensing of such information through education may be seen as
an attempt at eradication by some.

""The state""?  Parents should and do have a say in what their children
are taught.  It's a shame that parents who want to teach their children
a set of beliefs regardless of their relationship to reality exercise this
right all too much, producing non-thinking children (and later adults)
as a result.

It's even less surprising that a philosophy that assumes the existence of
god in a particular form leads to conclusions about the existence of god
that match those assumptions.  But of course, Gary is not assuming, he
knows the truth about the existence of god.  I will let him do so in the
reply article that is sure not to follow because he will never respond
to a Rich Rosen article again.

I said that the methods of education described above would ""effectively
wipe out religion"".  As I've said many times before, eradicating religion
by force is not a goal nor a desire of mine, though Samuelson would like
you to think because it aids him in his perpetually manipulative style
of rhetoric and argument.

Yes, Gary, we're all heinous fascists for wanting to encourage teaching of
""thinking before believing"" ideas.  Once we've ""forcibly"" stoppoed people
from wishful thinking about gods, we'll turn our evil hands towards other
wishful thinking beliefs like ...   Only a true scholar of fascistic
manipulation would go out of his way to twist words to imply that those
who support teaching rational thinking in schools are out to forcibly
crush other ideas like the purveyors of Nazi genocide.  If your ideas
are sound, Gary, after some rigorous examination, they will hold up.  If not,
they won't.  That's the ""force"" with which ""I"" (??) will ""wipe out""
fallacious thinking.  The stronger force of all.

I am an atheist and I want to have it both ways.  Moreover, I sinsirely
believe that I am rigth.  What those two ways are?
1.  I want the principle of tolerating religion to be extended 
    to tolerating lack of religion.
2.  I want to keep certain ideas in school.
Explanation of point 1.  
   Whatever the judges explenations in the quoted cases are, the core of 
the issue is:  should it be legal to make atheists second class citizens?  
Frankly, I am not interested in the letter of constitution or ""the intention 
of the founding fathers"" but in my legal rights.  I know relativism and I 
know that one can read the constitution in diffferent ways, all of them 
honest.  Still, I prefer such an interpretation which preserves my rights.
   The precedent quoted by Paul is very serious one.  If a notary public
must believe in God, that probably means that the oath of a person who
does not believe in God is not valid.  That would pave way to other laws:
the testimony of an atheist could be regarded as less valid, also an
atheist could be legally barred from taking jobs requiring an oath.
E.g. I needed to signed an oath to accept my university contract.
   I read an intervue with sen. Jesse Helms.  He claims that while the
constitution bars establishment of a religion, it allows, and even implies
the principle of believing in God (""one nation under the God"").  Thus when
I am afraid that someone wants to make me a second class citizen, I afraid 
of polititians which at this very moment may enact laws in many states.
   The quoted legal opinion really worries me.  It seems that judges 
agreed that someone may be required to have a religion to hold a public
position,  they merely disallowed that one may be required to believe in 
God.  Happily, I do not see any polititian proposing such a funny law.
Explanation of point 2.  
   I want to keep certain ideas in school in spite of the fact that they
are deemed to by holy by a sect of ""secular humanists"".  The reason is
that I regard those as useful and practical part of education.
   Any piece of school program may become a tenet of faith for some
group.  Shall we stop teaching geography if somebody makes an idol
of a globe?  Similarly, if somebody believes religiously in evolution
it does not mean that teaching geology should be forbidden.
   What foes of ""secular humanism"" are against?  I heard and read some
of them.  They are against the idea that the norms of good and bad are
created by humans.  Their classical example of ""brainwashing in the
spirit of secular humanism"" is the following.  The teacher asks the
students to write on the blackboard different moral principles, then
invents a situations of conflict between those principles and asks
students to decide what they would do.  The conclusion is that the
school trains students in moral relativism.  
   In short, the idea which is to be purged from school by Orrin Hatch's
ammendment is: honest people may have different moral choices.  
According to fundamentalists, this is false: if you cannot figure from
the Scripture what you should do, your preacher can.  If you listen
to Phillys Schaffly, Jesse Helms, Jerry Farwell etc. then it is clear
what is the worst part of the abominable secular humanism.  
Not evolution, but the tolerance.  If there would be any activity in
the school that teaches respect to other views or other lifestyles,
you should at best remove this activity, and at least be able to
forbid your children to participate.
   The New Right is well organized, has plenty of funds and promotes
a clear, logical vision.   What is not good, is bad.  No hesitation.
Children are our future, purity of their souls is the largest asset.
Thus we should never confront our children with an idea that an atheist
or homosexual may be a worthy human being.  Remove school activities
that may suggest that!  Remove books from libraries that may suggest
that!  Remove teachers that may suggest that!  (A law on the book in
Arkansas, I guess, forbids teachers to accept homosexualism in privite
conversations with students.)

 Wrong! Thats not what secular humanism teaches. It teaches little children
 how to think about suicide. It teaches them that some people's lives are
 worth less than others. It teaches them that homosexuality and premarital
 sex are choices for them to consider. It also teaches them to ignore any
 values they may be learning in the home and that values are purely subjective
 and how to make their own values. (if any!)
 Come on! No more BS! Secular humanism is designed to eliminate God from
 our society and its central target is the YOUNG!
 And its working just fine! Because most parents don't have the slightest
 idea what is going on in the public school systems.

My suggestion is for someone to get the exact wording of the legislation,
which I believe is on the D of Educ. authorization.  I was in Washington in
1984, and the bit about secular humanism was added by Orrin Hatch to
the D of Educ.'s 1985 authorization, but was not applicable to all schools.  
In that authorization, which I know passed the Senate but don't know what
happened in conference, federal funding was being used to set up magnate
schools or some such thing.  These would be regional ""super"" schools where
bright kids would be educated on math, science, literature, etc. making them
better engineers, scientist, leaders of the future.  This was being pushed
because of data on the number of these types being educated in USSR, Japan, 
China, etc.  
Anyway, Hatch added this stuff about no money going to secular humanism type
courses in these magnate schools.  Hatch may have gotten away with more in
the 1986 authorization and extended it to all schools with federal funds, 
almost all schools now both public and private.  I wouldn't be suprised.  But
before you go bananas over the loss of evolutionary biology, etc, take a 
look at the legislation.
Write to your Congressman requesting the Do educ.'s 1985 authorization and
budget, and the 1986 draft legislation for the authorization and budget.  I 
doubt that it has been passed into law yet.  For 1986, you should request
both the House and Senate versions.  (I would do this myself, but I am leaving
the net for at least three weeks and possibly permanently.  Moving to another
network...)

Well, lookie here.  ""Secular humanism teaches little children how
to think about suicide"".  Of course, with no explaination of why
or how.  Just a bald, manipulitive, misleading, emotional, co-opting
statment that is clearly intended to make peoples' knees jerk.
Suicide clearly exists.   Who commits suicide?  Lots of people.
Of course, they're all kids corrupted by secular humanism.  They're not
people affected by overpopulation, starvation, economic hardship,
LOSS of faith, and things like that.
And then:
> worth less than others. It teaches them that homosexuality and premarital
This isn't net.abortion.  What, let us see, does the ""Moral Majority""
teach us?  Well, one thing it teaches us is that black people are
worth less than whites, at least in South Africa.  I guess that means
that the ""Moral Majority"" is secular humanism too?  Yeah, sure  :-(
> sex are choices for them to consider. It also teaches them to ignore any
""Homosexuality and premarital sex""  Of course, lump two things,
clearly unrelated, together for the emotional kick it provides.
The first ""homosexuality"" is supposed to cause a knee-jerk 
fear reaction.  Of course, since Dan lumps them together, the second
""Premarital Sex"" must be the same.  Well, Dan, one of the points
of secular humanism is that different people have different
opinions, and that's all there is to it.  You seem to say that
I HAVE to hold your opinion.  Hell, you presume that I hold your
opinions. I don't.
> values they may be learning in the home and that values are purely subjective
> and how to make their own values. (if any!)
Sure, and since that's what you hear, that's what they teach.  Never
mind that they point out that many ""Christian"" ethics are necessary
for the functioning of society and the self-interest of the 
individual.  Never mind that secular humanism tries to establish
a NON-deistic ethos that provides each person a place.
(And that justifies being nice to others, etc, in a completely
non-superstitious way)
You don't.  You don't have any place for a 'secular humanist""
and you make that clear.  You consider, from the tone of your
article, ""secular humanists"" to be worth less than others.
Does that make YOU a secular humanist?  Or do you just have
the same ethos you're accusing them of?
> Come on! No more BS! Secular humanism is designed to eliminate God from

No BS?  Ok, start with yourself.  Your target is MY YOUNG.  You want
to brainwash them into believing an outdated, bankrupt set of

I have a good idea.  You're trying to prevent my children from
learning secular humanism, evolution, physics, chemistry, and
cosmology (among other things) and replace them with a
set of supernatural beliefs.

I think this merits a translation from the opinions of a fanatical Christian
into words approaching a more objective version of what secular humanism is
and what people like Boskovich say about it that it is not.
If it teaches them to think about suicide, about why people might feel
like committing suicide in this world (rather than covering up or ignoring
the fact), great!  If it teaches them to make their own choices about sex
based on positive real information and not edicts, great!  If it teaches
them that some people's lives are worth less than others, it's probably
a religious institution we're talking about and not a school teaching
the dreaded secular humanism (note how such religious schooling did and
still does teach about the inferiority of, not only non-Christian groups,
but even other Christian groups in many cases).  If it teaches them to
think for themselves and not blindly accept the values of their parents
and clergy, given them the faculties and tools to do so, GREAT!!!!!!!!
I can only hope for more of this in the future.
> Come on! No more BS! Secular humanism is designed to eliminate God from

Thank God for that!  :-)  This is the raving of a paranoid desperately
believing in some plot to ""eliminate god"".  If god is ""eliminated"" from
people's thoughts because they are taught a little bit of reasoning
ability to help them reach new conclusions, what are you going to do
about it?  Call teaching of such things ""secular humanism"" and try to
ban it?  That's exactly what you are doing with your vile disgusting lies
designed to smear the teaching to children of how to think for themselves
independent of you and your precious so-called values.
> And its working just fine! Because most parents don't have the slightest

Especially you, Mr. Boskovich.  It is most apparent that you are making
up stories about what ""the teaching of secular humanism in our schools""
is all about, to further your own sick ends.  Hopefully some day your
children may be able to write a set of essays about objective proof for
something (as you did) in which they actually provide objective proof,
having learned what it means and how to acquire it.  Why do you want to
stop this from happening?  Because you value your values more than the
good of your own children?

Anybody who would trust the word of Phyllis Schafly, a woman whose writing
uses as much substantiatory material as yours, Dan, I would question.
Dan, if you are such a ""good Christian"", why do feel the need to make up
lies about the ""evil secular humanism"" in order to preserve your values
at the expense of teaching your children about reasoning, science, and
independent thought?  Are you a Communist?  It sounds like a Communist plot
to squelch the minds of our children and make them willing slaves when
the Commies take over?  I don't believe this, of course, but reassure me
please:  are the fundamentalist Christians really Communists out to destroy
the foundation of American thinking?

I don't wish to get into the issue of premarital sex except to mention
that there it is not currently a method for some people to engage in
marriage under this American legal system, same sex couples for example.
HOWEVER, homosexuality is not a choice to consider, because it is a given.
That is to say that there are homosexuals, and those of us who are such
did not necessarily ""choose"" to be so.  It is true that some of us chose to
happily engage in homosexual activities rather than remaining in unhappy
little closets called acting hetro or remaining celibate.  And all schools
should teach that for homosexual children, there definately is that option.

Them's strong words, Dan, and I expect you to document them or say that you
are wrong.  By document I mean show me where in a ""secular humanist""
document that is identifiable as such the above are proffered.  I do not
mean in a book *about* ""secular humanism"" by some yo-ho like Phyllis
Shafley or Jimmy Swaggart.  I mean in a manifesto *by* so-called ""secular
humanists"" identifying themselves as such.  I suspect you will find these
charges are harder to prove than the popularists would tell you.

I can't imagine what you're talking about, what secular humanism
""teaches"" regarding suicide.  But I do know that I have yet to meet
anybody, religious or not, who hasn't at one time or another considered
suicide.  Why shouldn't we recognize that most Americans face thoughts
of suicide, and teach them what it *really* is - a permanent escape, not
only from the real but temporary pain they may be feeling at the time,
but also from the richness and joy that life has to offer them as they
travel through various experiences?  And teach them that *before* they
get into that pain, 'cause once they're desperate enough to consider
suicide, it's too little too late.
> It teaches them that some people's lives are

Huh? Who's lives are worth less than who's [whom's?]? How does it teach that?
> It teaches them that homosexuality and premarital

You mean they aren't choices?  All those people I know (including myself)
who have chosen one or the other or both have done the impossible?  Gosh.
Or are you saying that they *are* choices, but that the lives of homo-
sexuals and people who choose to have premarital sex are worth less than
other people's lives?
> It also teaches them to ignore any
>values they may be learning in the home and that values are purely subjective

It teaches them to make their own values?!  You mean it teaches them to
think for themselves, to evaluate options and make informed choices for
themselves?!  Gasp!  What is this country coming to when we have people
who think for themselves and don't just follow blindly when someone tells

You should have control over what they learn, this is exactly why I'm against
Planned Parenthood counseling.  I find it ironic that people are more against
puplic institutions teaching religion than against private institutions secretlycounseling kids on sex and secretely giving out birth control pills, and secret-ly performing abortions.  As you said, ""after all they ARE my kids.""

I think you'll find that the systematic exclusion of religious values
(and even religious practices) from the public schools to be fairly recent.
One thing that has always been considered part of the ""minimum necessary""
for the survival in society and society itself are certain standards of
moral conduct.  Are these unrelated to religious values?
As I see it, the problem with the public school's exclusion of religion
stems not from the fact that religious practice (e.g. public prayer
and religious services) and doctrine are excluded or not taught.  I'll
agree that the public schools are no place for this.  On the other hand,
the schools are *public*, tax supported, and compulsory.  When something
that is being taught in the public schools contradicts certain values
held by those who must send their children to these schools and support
them, those people ought to be allowed to have a say in what's going on.
Who decides what is the minimum necessary content of an education?  Is
the teaching of evolutionary theory absolutely necessary?  I think not.
One can teach biology, chemistry, and physics (the understanding of
how things work) quite apart from any speculations about their ultimate
origins.  These can be reserved for future studies in the school of
the students own choosing.
There are areas of conflict in what the public schools teach and what
many people believe.  As I see it these conflicts are most pronounced
in the areas of personal morality (e.g. the moral content of some sex
education programs and ""values clarification"") and origins (have we
evolved or were we created).  In these areas, I would think that there
should be a minimum of exposure to the various points of view.  Some
have said that this will only confuse students.  Maybe it will.  I
don't think we can say for certain, however, that it would be wrong.  Many
things in life are confusing.  With such things I think it is better to
be a little confused than to be decieved or infused with bias.  Confusion,
if it really is part of the subject, should not be avoided by giving neat
answers consonant with only one view.  By the time students are old enough
to grapple with the subjects themselves, they ought to also be exposed to
some of the diversity of opinion that exists in society on those issues.
To argue that some points of view ought to be excluded to avoid confusion
seems silly in principle.  I think this is clearer when we apply that
same principle to other areas.  Could we justify not teaching that some
countries don't value democracy or an open economy to avoid confusion?
What about differing views on war and peace?  Should students be exposed
to only one view of the Vietnam War to avoid confusion?  There is probably
a place for avoiding too much confusion, but we ought not to use it as
a pretext for giving one point of view a monopoly in public education.
To do so helps insure that students will close their minds to further
inquiry or persue such inquiry along a predetermined path.
If the public schools are public, then the public ought to have some
say where there are real points of conflict.  (Dredging up imagined or
remote ones along with them, as some have done, does little but muddy the
waters).  One solution, might be to cut back on the control the state
has over education and remove some of the financial and administrative
barriers to private education in competition with public.  This solution
seems to have some merit, but I haven't thought out all the implications
very thoroughly.  (Maybe someone else can expand on the possibilities).
Too much control in this area opens the door to tyranny equally well whether
the controlers are religious or secular.
>Religion is NOT necessary to survive 
>in our society.  I've survived quite nicely without, thank you.
You have survived in a society that is full of religion and which is
infused with many religious values.  It's part of the air you breathe.
Why do we routinely go to great expense and inconvenience to save
individual human lives?  Why must hundreds of people pull their cars
to the side of the road to let emergency vehicles through?  I think
it's greatly due to the fact that traditional religious values have
placed great value on the worth of the individual.  There are a lot
of things we take for granted that have religious roots.  Many hospitals
and major universities (consider Harvard and Yale; read their original
charters) were founded by the church.  Our present emphasis on education,
and advances in medicine has definite religious roots.
If you personally get along fine without religion, good for you.  But
your own perception can't be extended to say that society itself (in
which you've survived quite nicely) gets along fine without it.  That
would be a fatuous claim indeed.  One which many seem to take for granted,
however, in justifying the exclusion of certain values from public domain
(e.g. the public schools and government).

If certain information is barred from the education process, the extent of
which it can be said that any subsequent choice is informed is questionable.
Teaching the ability to gather and analyze *all knowledge* is hindered when
knowledge from certain sources and points of view are systematically
excluded.  For the most part I agree with this paragraph, however.  But
I'm wondering how your sentiments apply to the cumpulsory exclusion of
religious values from public space.

I would object to that.  Parents should not have full control over education
of their children.  I would not like you to forbid your child to learn
arithmetic.  I presume that Planned Parenthood doesnot councel how to make
69, but advises on the most fundamental question of biology.
Of course, kids should be smart enough to buy whatever supplies they need
in a drugstore.  But that requires some information.  Many of the people
raise their children in such a way that they are ashamed to ask for
condoms in a drugstore (even as adults).
Teaching about sex and providing services for planning parenthood is not
propagating promiscuism.  It merely faces the problem.  I think that it 
may be much easier for parents to explain aspects of sexuality to children, 
when they may assume that the children know the basic facts.  You may explain 
to your daughter why it is not good to engage in sex, even if she may do it.  
But if you just say that kissing is a sin, do not expect that she will heed
your advise.

And if parents would teach their kids about sex and birth control, instead
of having such outrageous puritan hangups about such topics, there wouldn't 
be a need for them to go to Planned Parenthood to learn.
If you're so worried about your children having knowledge, YOU censor them.
Let ME worry about MINE.  People are more concerned about public institutions
(i.e. schools) because they're mandatory.  Planned Parenthood is a resource,
not a requirement.

Does humanism teach little children to think about suicide?  I always thought

Children are people and not robots.  Their individuality and their minds must
be respected, not programmed.  Parents can try to ""shelter"" children all they
want, but in the end the young adult will make ones own decisions.  I
personally would want my children exposed to all philosophies, since in life 
they will encounter all philophies.  I would like them to know something
about several religions - why hide the fact that some people are religious
and that the various religions have different practices?  You can't hide
reality from people forever.  Now actually, the child of an anti-abortion
activist will probably learn about abortion much earlier than a child of
a pro-choice family.  I have heard so much discussion at home and after
church in my friends' fundamentalist home that their children must
*certainly* have some curiosity....  now in a pro-choice home the
discussion may never come up at all in front of four year olds, even
though it's always on the radio and TV - or do you make sure that the news
never reaches the ear of your children?  So parents can act like little
dictators and oppose Pravda while using it's techniques on sons and
daughters...
If a parents' moral and religious values are very strong, then they
should be able to withstand the presence of conflicting values.
Trying to shelter and suppress a child will only lead the child to
rebel and seek out all the information later.
Now with Planned Parenthood, this organization has *never* to my
knowledge recommended or advocated sexuality, but it does allow
the teenager to come into contact with medical information.  If
the parent creates a climate of empathy and discussion, then the
child can confide in the parents and there will be no need for
""secret"" counseling.  
Remember, unless you intend to raise your child under house arrest,
there is nothing you can do to physically stop your child from
having pre-marital sex.  So instead of being arbitrary and negative,
it is best to communicate with the teenager, and to voice, most
of all, that the son or daughter not get involved with someone
who doesn't treat him/her right.  The concern should be that
your son or daughter is not hurt or used.  
Again, parents can attempt to program their kids' minds, in which
the offspring may very well end up in the local mental institution
(or sleeping on Telegraph Avenue) or parents let the children learn
to cope with and deal with reality as it is.","Ya5JKxekTQAJ",1,1985-09-12,-3,1

Sorry, Frank, kids are their *own* selves, not ``yours.''  The fact
that a kid has gotten herself pregnant shows that ``you'' aren't in
control.  So you're going to force her to carry the pregnancy to term,
huh?  Quite a tyrant, aren't you!  Thank God for Planned Parenthood!  
And you're also going to ``control what they learn'' in this open
society of ours.  *Good luck*!  I suppose that *public libraries*
are on your list of ``private institutions secretly counseling''?  
(Oh, that's right, *public libraries* are public!  Worse yet!)  
(Sorry if this seems a bit inFLAMEtory, but it gets my gander up
when people talk about restricting the free flow of information!)

Thelemites here) to Crowley's defense, but it's appreciated.  I posted
Crowley's ""The Message of the Master Therion"" as sent to me by Josh Gordon,
when I was sending the New Age mailing list digests to net.religion a few
months ago (before fundamentalist flak convinced me that it was a bad idea).
This explained ""Will"" in fairly clear terms.  Now I'll post part two of my
""Introduction to Thelema"", still in production, which deals explicitly with
""Will"" as a basis for a moral system.  Or, as Bruce Smith would say, ""Would
you like some Thelemic literature?  Would you like to buy a flower?""
Thelemic Morality
=================
The fundamental tenet of Thelema is that the supreme moral principle is
""Do what thou wilt.""  First, look at what this is not.  Governments and
monotheistic religions adopt a uniform approach to morality, that of a list
of taboos.  Although the Mosaic Law is rather different in content from the
U.S. Penal Code, it is identical in approach.  A subset of all possible
actions is set down in writing and forbidden.  The worthlessness of this
approach should be clear: no such list can exhaust the possibilities of
immorality, and any attempt to make it do so creates an impenetrable
document.  The common man will never be able to do more than scratch its
surface; only a few scholars or lawyers will be able to apprehend its
entirety.  Thus the list of taboos forms no real moral guide.  It is to
virtually everyone just an ambiguous source of possible punishment, an
unknowable and impersonal force demanding fear and respect.
On the surface of it, ""Do what thou wilt"" is just as bad, or worse.  It
would seem to mean that one should do whatever one pleases, without regard
for morality.  However, the Book says more than ""There is no law beyond
Do what thou wilt.""  Allow me to quote briefly:
""The Word of Sin is Restriction....  thou hast no right but to do thy will.
Do that, and no other shall say nay.  For pure will, unassuaged of purpose,
delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.""
Clearly this ""will"" is rather different from the animal will, or that which
is normally called ""force of will"" or ""will-power"".  It is a divine, a
transcendent, Will which is referred to.  All ""Sin"", all ""wrong"", is but
the Restriction of that divine Will.  The relation to Taoistic concepts in
the latter sentence is apparent.
So now consider a society in which all keep to ""Do what thou wilt"".  None
imposes an obstacle to the Will of another; each seeks to know and do
her or his own Will to the fullest.  No one is content to sit all day,
rotting the mind with passive stimuli, kissing ass at work and squelching
any individual thoughts that may arise by mischance.  (We have all seen the
ostracism that afflicts those who dare disagree with their neighbors, and
would never dare incur that or abstain from its infliction, would we?  Such
is the cry of the middle classes.)  No one lives by deceiving others or
by violating their will to own property; no one kills, rapes, or commits
other crimes which restrict the Will of another.  In short, the
completeness of morality, both all aspiration to Godhead and all worthwhile
taboo, is expressed in that one phrase, ""Do what thou wilt"".
Of course, such a society will never exist, but morality is inherently
quixotic.  (Why will it never exist?  Because institutions devoted to the
lists of taboos exist, and under ""Do what thou wilt"" it would be immoral to
destroy them by force, provided they do not directly attack our freedoms.)
Society can never reach perfection; interpersonal morality consists largely
of determining what that impossible perfection would be like, and conforming
one's own behavior to it as much as possible.
There is a real psychological difference between the Law of ""Do what thou
wilt"", and the list of taboos.  To verify this, try to explain ""Do what thou
wilt"" to a fundamentalist Christian, an Orthodox Jew, or some other who is
emotionally or dogmatically attached to one of the lists of taboos.  The
person will prove simply incapable of understanding non-taboo-based morality
in most cases.  The difference is what Crowley liked to call the
Sin-Complex.  The taboo-monger cries ""Not my will but thine be done!""  He
sees himself as a cringing worm, bereft of all virtue and capable of good
only when under the control (or at the least guidance) of some force outside
himself.  This attitude is useful to religious and political leaders, and
thus its predominance.  Who understands and follows the Law knows that,
though subject to a myriad ignoble attractions and repulsions, she or he
contains the divine spark that redeems all the rest, awaiting only the Work
to bring it to light.  The psychological benefits of realizing that one's
core is good, not evil, are immense; in fact, there is a school of
psychoanalysis, the Rogerian, which deals with nothing else.
Thelema is the foe of all sexism.  The third verse of the first chapter (a
rather prominent position!) is ""Every man and every woman is a star"", thus
explicitly denying all sexist ideas.  Furthermore, the cosmological model
involves the uniting of the goddess Nuit with the god Hadit to form the
hermaphroditic Ra-Hoor-Khuit, rather than a male god spurting out the
Universe in an act of masturbatory genesis, or a female goddess who
parthenogenetically birthed all life.  The Universe is the dynamic union of
male and female, not the creation of either alone.  Numerous parallels from
Hinduism and Buddhism will no doubt occur to the East-inclined reader.
The only ""evil"" is not direct restriction of the Will.  The release from
restriction can create an unbalanced response which is not in conformity
with the Will.  Rather than returning to the Will, one may swing to the
opposite extreme from the former restriction.  For instance, a slave who
seeks to enslave his or her former masters rather than seek equality for
all, or a person who reacts against religion dominated by a single gender by
forming a religion dominated by the other gender rather than a sexually
egalitarian religion, or someone who reacts against hypocritical standards
of ""good"" by identifying himself with ""evil"".  These are extreme cases; the
unbalance involved in reaction against Restriction can be far more subtle.
One predominant feature of morality is the carrot and stick aspect.  Why
should you follow an inconvenient moral code?  In the list of taboos
approach, the answer is simple: you will be punished if you transgress, and
rewarded if you keep to the straight and narrow.  The Hindu idea of karma
and its variants such as the Law of Three are similar.  There is no
""official"" Thelemic position.  It seems evident that seeking to know and do
the Will will lead to a less painful and restricted life.  Crowley himself
believed in karma in the literal reincarnatory sense; I don't believe in the
afterlife, but I do feel that acts of deceit and such carry their own
psychological penalty which is immediate and self-inflicted.  I don't mean
guilt, which fails to effect many people; I mean paranoia in its overt and
subtle manifestations.  Most people are insufficiently introspective to see
that their enjoyment of life is dwindling when they increase their use of
deceit, but the negative effects are no less real for that.  The crooked
businessman, the liar, the thief, the murderer: all are always on the run,
always looking over their shoulder to see who's either trying to do to them
what they have done to others or found out about their misdeeds.  The
attitude of these people is always that the world is ""dog eat dog""; they can
never reach any real contentment or rest.
Recently, an attempt has been made to improve upon ""Do what thou wilt"" by
prepending ""An it harm none"".  I ask that anyone devoted to this formula
realize that I am only speaking what seems to me the truth, the result of
sincere analysis.  I formerly accepted this formulation, but came to see
that it was seriously flawed.
The ""Wiccan Rede"", as the modified version of the Law is usually called,
misses the point of ""Do what thou wilt"" from both the negative and positive
perspectives.  Negatively, the Law is non-interference, not non-harm.  The
will to harm is valid in unusual cases.  For instance, an Allied soldier in
the Second World War should not be called ""immoral"" for removing Axis
soldiers from incarnation: the Nazis were deliberately engaged in an
enterprise whose goal was to thwart the wills of all Jews, and any others
who disagreed with the Nazi party line.  Yet under the Rede that Allied
soldier could not have pulled his trigger, because it is harming someone to
injure or kill him.  It is no use to object that under the Rede the Nazi
would be likewise restrained, because such situations do arise in the real
world and must be dealt with.  Under the Law it is clear: the Nazi is not
acting in accord with his will because he acts to block the wills of others,
and therefore it is not a violation of his divine will to force him to stop
this interference.
Certainly causing harm is something any sane person seeks to avoid whenever
possible, and most obstacles can be gone around instead of destroyed.  But
to elevate non-harm to a primary position in one's morality is to ignore the
reality, that harming is not only justifiable but necessary in some cases.
At the turn of the century, many occultists and theosophists staggered under
the burdens of the right wing, such as anti-Semitism and fascism; as the
next century approaches, many occultists and witches stagger under the
burdens of the left, such as pacifism.  Both must be transcended.
It is also possible to interfere with another's Will without doing any
""harm"" as far as the person interfering is aware.  To pick another extremely
clear-cut example, Soviet psychiatrists honestly believe that to oppose the
state is a mental illness.  They are thus, as far as they know, not harming
someone by removing such opposition.  All ""harm"" short of the infliction of
physical injury is a subjective judgment, so the actions of the brainwashers
are in accord with the Rede.  Under the Law, however, no such fallacy is
possible:  that this is interference with the person is an undeniable,
objective fact.  A closer-to-home example of ""harmless"" interference, and of
how it is permitted by the Rede, is provided by the president of Covenant of
the Goddess who told me she would like to see violent sports made illegal.
Of course, it is possible to define harm in terms of interference, but then
why not just use the original version?  Still, I can't see anything wrong
with the Rede under that interpretation, except that it is still only the
negative, the forbidding, half of morality.
The positive perspective on the Law is that one is to learn and do the
divine Will.  This is wholly lacking in the modified version.  The Rede can
be paraphrased as ""Do whatever you feel like so long as it doesn't hurt
anyone.""  The mere human will is the only thing mentioned: at least, I have
never seen any Wiccan commentator take the Rede in any other light.  Where
is the aspiration in this?  Where is the moral obligation to realize one's
fullest potential?  Morality is not simply to refrain from evil, but to do
good; but you would never know that from the Rede.
I have spent so much time on this because pacifism is a serious fallacy, a
Restriction of the Will of the same order as a taboo against premarital sex.
In fact, if one examines the beliefs of the leading original exponents of
pacifism in this century, such as Gandhi, their sexual priggishness is
obvious.  This is not a coincidence.  Remember always that to strike is as
blessed as to stroke, provided only that it is the true Will to do so.

Ray, it's about time you STARTED thinking, and presenting facts.  I have yet
to see a single solitary one fact from you in all your articles.  Do you have
any to offer?  I think dispensing data about making sex safe and describing
alternatives to people IS the very purpose of an information center on sex,
and I for one am glad they do it.  Tell me, are you Ken Arndt in a new
location?  Or did Ken just give you lessons on how a rampant know-nothing

I guess then that if the teenagers of the United States wish to have
sex, then they should all risk VD, etc, even though there are means
available to educate these people!  This posting is one of the most
naive I have read in a long time, if Mr. Frank would ever crawl out
from under his prejudices and take a look at the world, perhaps he'd
learn a thing or two.
I guess these options should not be available to those who are married,
either, after all, Planned Parenthood doesn't just counsel teenage
girls!

	It's less clear in other translations. The RSV says ""And they
called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them
out to us, that we may know them.'"". And the King James also says ""know
them"" rather than ""have sex with them"". A bit more ambiguous, I would
say.
	But the really interesting part of the story comes in the following
verses. Remember, according to the Bible, Lot is a righteous man, and
he and his family are the only ones saved when Sodom is destroyed. So,
what does he do about his demanding neighbors?
		""Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after
	him, and said, 'I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
	Behold, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me bring
	them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing
	to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.'""
	[RSV, Genesis 19:6-8]
	My thanks to Robert A. Heinlein, who pointed out this interesting
example of Lot's upright ways in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.

 Thanks Kenn for helping to prove Don Black's statement. Yes, Lots
 solution was sinful. Lot should not of compromised Gods law to avoid
 trouble. Peter and John wouldn't compromise to avoid trouble and ended
 up in jail for it. Acts 4 0r 5, I believe? However, Lot's solution
 proves the point. He would of sacrificed his daughters virtue to satisfy
 the sexual desires of the people of Sodom. Also, in Gen 4 when Adam
 ""knew"" his wife, she got pregnant! Get the idea!
 Lot was a righteous man only because he was declared righteouss by God!
 Just as Mathew, a terrible publican; Saul of Tarsus, a persecutor of
 Christians; and Isaiah, a man of unclean lips.
 This illustration of Lot's sin, does not contradict the declaration of
 his righteousness, but illustrates the power of God to save sinners!
 Jesus said He came into the world to call not the righteous, but the
 sinners unto repentance. God has cleverly illustrated the flaws of all
 of the great men of the bible, to illustrate the truth of Romans 3!

So the ""Christianoids"" have retranslated the bible to agree with their

I would assume that in Scott Deerwester's New International Version (NIV)

now ""the Tree of Sex of Good and Evil"".  Since it would seem that knowing
translates directly into sex in that translation, regardless of the original

I can't translate the Hebrew on my own, but the Jewish Publication Society
translation (a fairly new, very scholarly version that's officially accepted
by Conservative Judaism) renders the passage as:
	Where are the men who came to you tonight?  Bring them out to us,
	that we may be intimate with them.

Yes, that's how I learned it.
The story of Lot's daughters is also interesting.  Immediately after
the destruction of Sodom, and Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt,
Lot probably wasn't feeling too great.  His daughters thought that
the whole world had been destroyed, and that Lot was the last man on earth.
To keep the human race going (they believed), they got him drunk and
had sex with him.  The child of the older daughter was Moab, the ancestor
of Ruth, the ancestor of King David.

Wait a minute.  Wasn't Jesus related to David in some way, through

Do erroneous statements such as these represent the typical Christian's
understanding of God's word?
First of all the hebrew verb ""to know"" used
in the text on Sodom in Genesis 19 occurs 943 times in the Old Testament.  In
only ten of these occurrences does it have the sense of carnal knowledge.  The
Greek translations use an expression equivalent to ""making the aquaintance of""
or ""becoming familiar with"" which is in marked contrast to the verbs employed
in reference to Lot's daughters which clearly refer to sexual behavior.
(I would put both Hebrew and Greek versions here but USENET is not as
powerful as my Macintosh :-) )
Jesus himself refers to Sodom implying that inhospitality was its undoing
(Matt. 10:14-15, Luke 10:10-12.)   Ezekiel not only lists the sins of Sodom
   ""pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness.. neither did
she strengthen the hand of the poor and the needy"" (16:48-49 KJV) but contends
that they are less serious than the sexual sins of Jerusalem.
Ecclesiasticus says God abhorred the Sodomites for their pride (16:8).
The bottom line here is that interpretation of the Sodom story in terms of
homosexuality is disputed by all later references in the Bible itself.  This
is only the tip of the iceberg.  For those interested (especially Christians
that claim they care about truely understanding what God's word
says) I suggest reading Chapter Four of John Boswell's ""Christianity, Social
Tolerance, and Homosexuality"" where this came from.  As far as that goes, you
can read the rest of the book to to get an idea how ""Christian"" viewpoints can
change from season to season on this and other issues.

much of my time reading these articles that it is worth trying to get rid of
the issue once and for all.  I am referring to the discussion of what the
citizens of Sodom intended to do with Lot's visitors.  The word is tranlated
""know"" in older translations.  Everyone agrees that this sometimes means to
have sexual relations with, but not everyone agrees that this is the meaning
in this passage.  Other suggestions are ""to be intimate with"", and -- well,
I'm not sure quite what the most recent message actually was suggesting.  It
objected to the sexual implication, but didn't offer an alternative.  I
think all of these alternatives fall apart if you actually think about them.
These are the guys who, when they couldn't get to Lot's guest, instead raped
his daughter.  I find it hard to believe that there original intentions were
either to come to know these people as friends, or to have an intimate, but
non-sexual relationship with them.  Given the later course of the story, I
don't think we need any other evidence to be reasonably sure that ""know"" is
being used as a euphemism.  I also don't see why anybody believes that this
passage has anything to do with homosexuality.  Sure, the actions they
originally proposed to take were homosexual.  But when they couldn't they

these guys were particularly interested in homosexuality per se.  And even
if they were, you forget that what they proposed to do was rape.  No matter
what our stand on homosexuality per se, surely we all agree that homosexual
rape is wrong, and is far more serious than homosexual acts between
consenting people.  Even ignoring the issue of the rights of guests, these
guys were turned to salt because of rape, not because of their sexual
orientation.
Before someone gives any more proposed interpretations of this passage,

Raped Lot's daughters?  I find where Lot offered his daughters, but
cannot find anything which says the citizens of Sodom took Lot up
on his offer.
You bring up a good point about rape being a capital offense.  As I
recall, rape of a married woman was, biblically, a capital offense.
But I don't remember that rape of a virgin -- a very serious offense --
was punishable by death.

 Let me clear this up once and for all!  The Hebrew word translated
 ""know"" or ""knew"" is ""yadah"", which means an ""intimate relationship"".
 True, it is only used in the context of sex a relatively few amount
 of times. It also is used to describe the relationship between God and
 Abraham.
 The key to understanding what the word is referring to is obviously
 context.
 The men of Sodom said to Lot, ""Send the men out here so that we may
 ""know"" them.
 Now, this cannot mean that they wanted to get to know them better and
 start a close friendship with them, because Lot replied, Please do not
 do such an evil thing!  There is nothing evil about cultivating a
 friendship.
 Second, The men could not have wanted to beat them up, or mug them,
 because the word ""yadah"" would have been inapropiate, as it means
 an intimate relationship.
 Third, if the men would have been guilty of unhospitality, they would
 have been in their homes minding their own business, not congragating
 in front of Lot's home to see the visitors.
 So finally, the conclusion would have to be that they wanted to use
 the visitors sexually. Now Lot did not exercise wisdom here, granted.
 It is obvious that Lot was a compromised man. He called the men of Sodom
 ""friends"". He lived there in the midst of all the sin going on there.
 He had grown so used to sin that he was willing to compromise. This is
 why it is so important for a church to discipline sin. Sin is like
 cancer. Its grows and grows. Before long Gods own people begin to
 tolerate it.
 Lot was willing to give up his daughters virtue hoping to satisfy the
 sexual hunger of the men of Sodom. The men would have nothing to do
 with them, however!
 The absence of homosexuality on a listing of sins of Sodom does not
 mean that it wasn't among them. Sodom was guilty of many sins. There
 character was one of rebellion illustrated by their failure to
 repent even after inflicted with judgment (blindness).
 The sins of Jerusalem would be greater because they were guilty of
 Apostasy! They had received the Law, they had a covenant with God,
 and they had the greater revelation, but they rejected it. They were
 guilty of spiritual pride and apostasy. Same principle as below!
 Jesus did not say the sin of Sodom was unhospitality. He was saying that
 the judgement of Sodom would not be as great as these cities because
 their sin was greater than Sodoms. That is, to see, hear, and experience
 Jesus Christ, and then to reject Him.
 The only sin that will keep a man out of the Kingdom of God, is the
 sin of rejecting the saviour.
 This illustrates Gods perspective on Sin. All have sinned and missed Gods
 mark!
 God makes men new creations. For those of you who profess to be Christians
 and are Gay, remember that Romans teaches of the old man who died with
 Christ, and has been raised from the dead in the newness of Life. All
 of us struggle with sin, but there is NO CONDEMNATION to those who are
 in Christ (Rom. 8:1) and if any man sins we have an advocate with the
 Father (John 1:9).
 But TRUE repentance is to surrender ALL to Him.
 Christ said that not all who call me Lord will be with me in the Kingdom!
 Make sure you don't just CALL Him Lord, but that He IS TRULY Lord of
 your WHOLE life!
 Paul said, ""Examine yourselves, to determine whether or not you are truly

It seems apparent to me that you hold the indivdual personally 
responsible for the sexuality he/she has as if it were the 
individual's choice whether or not to be gay.  The logical reason I 
offer against your simple refusal to associate with homosexuals 
is this: sexuality is not a matter of taste, and just as you did 
not sit down and decide to be heterosexual (which I am assuming 
you are), homosexuals did not make the decision to be gay 
either.  I consider it against my religion (Catholic) to blame 
anyone for something which he/she cannot control.  In fact, 
recent scientific findings suggest that one's sexuality 
is determined before birth.  
In other words, whether or not you or the entire heterosexual 
community decides to refuse homosexuals the rights they deserve, 
homosexuality will go on, either openly or ""behind the closet 
door"".  The best thing to do, as I see it, would be to accept
this and confront the fact that many people will not act in 
accord with our personal prejudices.

In a sense, an individual's sexuality is indeed a matter of choice.  But the
choice is between believing that the other sex is a friend or an enemy.  There
may be variants on this; one time when I had to battle some strong homosexual
feelings was a time when I felt that God would (for reasons of His own) never
allow me to have an intimate relationship with a woman -- the result of which
would be that if I tried, God would ensure that I got badly hurt; so a woman
would be, in a way, an enemy.  (Mind you, this is one of several aspects of my
view of God that have been mellowed out in the last couple of years.)  My
thesis is that confirmed homosexuals became convinced very early on -- in early
childhood, perhaps -- that the other sex was somehow an enemy, and that being
intimate with an other-sex person would be extremely threatening.  However, the
mere fact that their belief is very deep-seated, and probably based on very deep
wounds, does not mean that it can't be changed.  Having God's love and power to
assist helps a lot.
In other words, homosexuals and heterosexuals both decided their sexuality,
probably not consciously, but decided nevertheless.  I don't blame homosexuals
for their choice; given the data presented to them, that undoubtedly seemed the
best choice at the time, the one that reflected their perception of reality.
But they can be given different data, about reality the way it actually is,
and enabled to choose differently.  This could even be done without God, but
why do that when He's available and wants to help?

Lissen, Sargent, we had this discussion a loong time ago, in a newsgroup

serious counseling as a valid option.  But it is outrageous that he should
take these peculiar, private explanations for his neuroses and paint gay people

I think that you assume one hell of a lot.  I do not look on any women as
being in any respect my enemy, nor do any of the other gay people that I
associate with.  Also, since Gods love is for all, I think you make another
large assumption in assuming that gays do not have His power and support
throughout our entire lives (we particularly need His help to deal with
the homophobes misusing His name to oppress us).

made the claim that he isn't a ""confirmed homosexual.""  If he limited his

Jeff.  The offensive part is that he is fearless in making claims about other

Sorry, but I still claim that homosexuality is a form of neurosis, and
neurosis is a result of sin -- holding to false beliefs about oneself and
one's environment.  There are many cases of homosexuals being delivered
from homosexuality by the power of God.  (I'll probably expand on this idea
when I respond to Richard Brower's article.)

Actually the last half of the first sentence is no longer true....  I am
seeing regularly a man who is now officially a minister, but whose previous
work was full-time marriage & family counseling; he is thus very helpful in
helping me sort out my relationship problems.  I used net.singles as a support
group because it's easier to trust people at a distance than people I see
regularly -- the distant ones can't do much to me, especially since by the
time I see their responses, my hurting emotional state has passed.

Perhaps in one way I am being a bit presumptive, since I've never actually
fallen into homosexuality full-fledgedly.  But I have had more struggles with
homosexual feelings than most people I've talked to; so I'm not 100% ignorant.
I do wonder why my statements provoke a flame.  It has been my experience that
heated denials often are a cover for a truth that the denier does not want
to accept or admit.  Might I suggest that you examine yourself and see if
perhaps, at bottom, you really do have some -- shall we say, reservations --
about homosexuality.

Clearly not as many as being delivered *to* homosexuality--and you
don't need a revelation to see that; queueing theory will do fine.
Actually, the whole fundamentalist dogma fits into a queueing model
rather nicely.  Until the big interrupt comes, anyway.
But this ""neurosis is a result of sin""--what an intriguing hypothesis.
Don't stop there, Jeff.  Surely other diseases are caused by sin, too.
Especially the really disgusting ones like cancer of the pancreas and
the black death.  The so-called ""germ theory"" is an even more
invidiously humanist plot than evolution.
How do we get rid of this sin?  Heh, heh (thank you, Mr. Calvin)--
we *beat* it out of them!  But wait, this is the 20th Century.  What
are we, barbarians?  We don't have to resort to *fisticuffs* any more.
We can beat the odious sin out of those filthy, perverted (but
otherwise lovable) sinners *electronically*.  In net.religion.
*EVERY SINGLE DAY*.

It's clear in Sargent's entire response to my article that he has missed
the point.  He still is writing out of befuddlement, amazed that anyone
could possibly take offense at his bizarre generalizations.  Regardless of
their origin (more on that later) his comments are akin to so-called
christians proseletyzing among Jews, so filled with self-righteousness that
they do not see their capacity for insult.  I make no comment on his last
paragraph here, except to repeat it, so it can stand off by itself, as
another example of the kind of ad-hominem double-talk and evasiveness we
see repeatedly coming from the fundamentalist corner.
I received a response by mail to my first comment on Jeff's article:

This just about sums it up.  I have no problem hearing Jeff's explanations
of his own mental processes, but he needs to understand that only Jeff works
like Jeff, and to assume otherwise is to invite misunderstanding.  To then
publically propose this as the mechanism by which 10% of the population
operates, is to provoke anger and flames.  I speak up here against Jeff
Sargent's view of gay people, not because, as he so glibly states, that
I have ""reservations about homosexuality"", but because *someone* needs
to state the contrary--a statement like his should not go unchallenged.

And I still claim that the world is flat. You show me the literature backing
up your claim and I'll show you the literature backing up mine. Both are
equally valid.
I can think of any number of cases where homosexuals were reassured that
they were 'normal' by religion as well. It works both ways. As it should,
of course. Some homosexuals are neurotic, but then, so are some Christians.
If we choose our studies carefully enough we can prove anything while
proving nothing.

I will admit that once a gay man explained his homosexuality to me as

just doesn't appeal to you.  Now imagine feeling that way about women.""

virtually no genuine human contact), and by giving themselves to Christ
they were able to become happy, fulfilled heterosexuals.  If you actually
like being homosexual, and have actual human contact (soul touching soul
and spirit touching spirit, not just body contact) in that lifestyle, then
Christ may have a hard time convincing you that there's something better.
Your last sentence does make an interesting point.  God is merciful enough to
help those who do not give themselves to him 100% (else who would ever be

Amazing how Jeff gleaned from such an account that women would be perceived
as enemies by gays.  I would assume that this means that Jeff thinks of all
men as HIS enemies, by this same logic.  (After all, he wouldn't want to
have sex with them, would he?)

There are a lot of people of all sexual (and other) persuasions who live lives
with virtually no human contact; that's one of the tragedies of our modern
society in many ways.  Unfortunately, I see many heterosexuals (and
homosexuals) being quite accepting of this, which is perhaps sadder.  Such
non-contact may not be the status quo, but to varying degrees it permeates all
strata of society.  Jeff's last sentence sounds so strained, as though he
doesn't believe the parenthetical could ACTUALLY be possible.  What is this
""something better"" than ""actual human contact""?  I surmise that it is ""better""
only by your own subjective perspective and presupposition about what SHOULD
be ""best"", such as when you made your statement about ""sex is intended as a
total union"":  who told you the intentions of the intender, and what's more
where do you get off assuming that there IS an ""intender"" and that it has the
same motives that you have?

Actually, much of the problem with being a homosexual has to do with the fact
that the oppression of gay people has been an American rallying point for
generations.  Many more gay relationships would be successful if we were
not told by all you ""good"" folks that all we are into is 'body contact'.
Your relationships are 'blessed by God' and good... my relationship is banal?
There you go with another assumtion.  Why doesn't my life partener qualify
for company health insurance... he is the wrong sex.
Well, I'll get by, but it is more difficult... and compared to a few years ago,
things are easy today.

As for the above paragraph, it is yet another example of intolerance.  Not
only are the mainstream prodestant denominatins (of which you are fairly
obviously not a member) currently reaching out to the gay community, with
the understanding that gays are not automaticly doomed, but several
Christian groupings are being formed by gay people.  Gays have often been
good Christians, although 'straight' churchs have had a great deal of trouble
dealing with us.  For some real Christian spirit, join your local Metropolitan
Community Church, even if only for a few services.  Communion is open to all
believers and everyone is invited to participate.

I have already stated on two occasions very clearly, very plainly, with
absolutely NO MARGIN FOR MISINTERPRETATION that I have no problem WHATSOEVER
with you discriminating against me.  That means not selling me a house, denying
me a job, firing me, refusing to do business with me.  That means that I will

I'll bite.  Given that the homosexual (it could also be any person,
Christian, Jew, Moslem, Atheist, Bahai, heterosexual or any-other-sexual
you can imagine) does not disrupt work by bringing their personal
ideosyncracies into the workplace, then they should win the suit.
Simple enough?
The funny thing, Brunson, is that you probably have non-heterosexuals
(interesting word) working for you now, or will have them working
for you in the future and you won't know it.  I'd also guess that
there are lots of people you'd refuse to hire thinking they were gay
who, in fact, are not.  It's ironic that you aren't discriminating
on the basis of sexual preference, but on the basis of honesty.
(Unless, of course, you're given to creeping and peeping around
folks bedrooms at night in which case you are definitely due for
a spell in the slammer.)

To answer your question, the person who refuses to hire homosexuals
should lose, and the homosexual should win.  ""Should"" means that, in
my opinion, this is what I believe is more just.
The problem is that the employer wishes to hire only people who he/she is
comfortable having around, while the person looking for work wishes to
have access to any job based only on their ability, not the personal
preferences of the employer.  I believe that it is more important for
the employee to be protected from discrimination than it is for the
employer to be allowed to discriminate.

The fact that it is a Bible believer who is the discriminator is irrelevant.
When I say ""Bible believer"" most people will assume that I mean a Jerry-Falwell-

Make him a Jew or Moslem or Atheist or whatever you like.  Also
the statement ""Arguments concerning the rightness or wrongness of his position
are now irrelevant"" is not correct.  What I meant to say is that the dis-
criminator's motives are irrelevant.  That is, when you ask him the question,
""Oh come now, let's talk about this.  Why do you want to discriminate against
this harmless homosexual?"", anything that he says to defend his position
is independent of the moral question before the house, which is, once again,

Some person may refuse to accept the arguments of society that smashing
the windows of other peoples' cars is not a good thing to do.  In their
mind, the people who attempt to stop them from doing this are infringing
on their rights.  My response?  Tough.  Just because Bible-believing citizens
don't like gays doesn't mean we have to honor their views.  Just because they
think gays are, in a sense, criminals doesn't mean they are criminals.

Well, one thing I understand is that if you don't have anything worthwhile
to say, saying it at 150dB doesn't make it any more worthwhile.  Fine.
Nobody will change your mind.  I hope you realize that by abjuring reason,
you've probably blown your chances of changing anybody else's mind.  Indeed,
there is no ""nice-guy"" way to handle the problem.  Society either has to
be nasty to the ""Bible believers"" or to gays.  I think it should be nasty
to the ""Bible believers"".  Their actions directly and provably harm gays.
The gays' actions can only be shown to harm other people by swallowing
the ""Bible believers'"" anti-gay line hook, line, and sinker.  I operate -
and most of the people arguing the pro-gay position operate - on the principle
that enjoining someone from doing something that doesn't demonstratably harm
other people is *immoral*.  That's right, immoral.  We don't pussyfoot around
here; I'll pull out the tough expletives and use them here.  Therefore the
gay should win the suit, and the ""Bible believer"" should be condemned.
OK.  You probably dislike this conclusion.  Either 1) you have a *purely*
rational argument against it (""gays are doing themselves and others harm
because their action is a sin"" don't cut it) - in which case, please present
it or 2) you dislike it because it disagrees with a strongly- but not
rationally-held conviction of yours - in which case, you are probably turning
more people against you than you are convincing to support you, and you
are making a public nuisance out of yourself, so stop it.

Bullshit.  In your ideal world, I'd seriously consider getting my tubes
cut.  I'd not want to subject any child of mine to a world in which people
who disagreed with their values, without being demonstratably and objectively
harmed by the consequences of those values, could enforce their judgements
against their ways of life.  Gays *are* demonstratably and objectively harmed
by employment discrimination - it's hard to live without eating, and it's
hard to eat without being able to afford your food, and it's hard to be
able to afford food without getting paid by an employer.

I made this point in an earlier article, and the absence of such phrases
made be believe I had been successful.  I suppose it is more likely that
my message didn't get out.
I do not know of any Christian who does not believe in the Bible.  However,
many Christians I know do not consider homosexuals criminals, do not
believe in disciminating against them, do not believe they are sick and
need to be reformed.  Some Christians I know are gay, and are comfortable
with their God.
The fact is that very few generalizations can be made about believers in
the Bible.  There are very peaceful and quiet believers and there are
agressive (even violent) and missionary believers, and everything in
between (and beyond) these endpoints.  The problem with making (and
accepting) such generalizations is that you have to then invent some
word or phrase which describes the Christians not covered by Dave Brunson's
(or whoever's) Bible beliefs.  Try and convince the gay congregations
(there are several in this country) that they are not Bible believers,
and that they should be called ""Bible-nonbelievers"".  Good luck.  Until
you do, please do not use such phrases.

I don't think you have the right to get so upset about people who assumed
that you were posing a religious question -- at the very least, your original
posting (remember, the one with the patronizing references to Jews, and how
you would derive spiritual brownie points by hiring one) was so poorly
worded that most respondents felt you were trying to set your religious
beliefs above the law.  Now you say, though, that your claim is simply that
gays ought not be a protected class under the law.  You seem to be going
a step further, and implying that while (some classes of) disrimination are
wrong, the law should not provide any protection at all.
Neither of those propositions is inherently indefensible; indeed, many
libertarians advocate the latter as an all-encompassing general policy.
As a card-carrying liberal (I'm a member of the ACLU...), I strongly
disagree.  I'll make an equally sweeping counterclaim -- that any refusal
to hire someone based on anything other than their ability to do the job
is morally wrong, and should probably be legally wrong as well.  In practice
(and probably as a matter of principle), explicit legal protection is
extended only to those groups where there exists a proven history of
massive discrimination -- i.e., against blacks, religious minorities,
women, etc.  Given the widespread homophobia in our society, and many
explicit calls that gays should not be hired, I therefore claim that
sexual preference should be a protected class under the applicable civil
rights statutes.

If quoting random statistics and journals is to be thought of as evidence
of intelligence (or as evidence of having something reasonable to say), then
it's no wonder certain people get elected to high office.  Arndt may be
""flashy"" in that he shows people the TRAPPINGS of intelligence and reason,
but if that alone gives the impression that he really IS intelligent or that
he actually has something important to say, then perhaps he's well suited to
go into advertising (or more likely propaganda).  Don't let people like Arndt
or Brunson or Bickford snow you.  Look what the Germans got when they fell for
it.  Look what we're getting.
If they produce random quotings of ""authorities"" instead of facts, if
they can't justify their own requests for justification by others, if the
sum and total of all their logic is a ridiculous emotional appeal designed to
make you believe notions that have no logical basis in fact, then just ignore
them.  Or else point them out for what they are.

reply to comments from Steve Bellovin
We finally seem to be making some progress here.  First let me take
care of some small business which I hope won't start another round
of tangents.
>P.S.  Given that the premise of the argument is now apparently political
>instead of religious, I've cross-posted this to net.politics.  Future
>discussion should probably not take place in net.religion....
I quote the stated purpose of net.religion:
""net.religion:	Religious, ethical, and moral implications of actions.""
By this statement the ""Gay Rights"" discussion is one of the very *few*
appropriate discussions happening in net.religion.  I am asking a moral
question.  A question of right and wrong.  I don't know how I could have
worded the question any more clearly and I don't see why I am still being
misunderstood.  A question of judgement has been proposed.  I am asking
people to comment on the ""ethical and moral implications"" of this judgement.

As far as I know my only major error so far was an early attempt at arguing
that homosexuals are invalid as a minority because they can change their
behavior.  Many people correctly jumped on that.  I don't care to defend
my ""poorly worded"" posting because that could easily get us off the subject.
Let's just drop it.  As for the last sentence, you have misunderstood
my meaning.  But that is a tangential point and you show promising signs of
addressing the important issue in the next paragraph:
>As a card-carrying liberal (I'm a member of the ACLU...), I strongly
>disagree.  I'll make an equally sweeping counterclaim -- that any refusal
>to hire someone based on anything other than their ability to do the job
>is morally wrong, and should probably be legally wrong as well.
First of all, let me congratulate you on your membership in the ACLU.  They
do a lot of good things.  Let me further congratulate you on your second 
sentence: ""any refusal to hire someone based on anything other than their
ability to do the job is *morally* wrong...""   You just said the magic words!
Now, can you explain yourself here in more depth?  Why is it *morally* wrong
to refuse to hire someone?  Please understand that I am not being obtuse.
The statement may seem perfectly obvious to you, but it is entirely alien
to me.  I can easily imagine scenarios where it *could* be morally wrong
to refuse hiring, but to make hiring a universal moral principle strikes me
as an odd proposal.  It seems to me that you must be making some assumption
about how the world works which I don't share and that you take for granted.
If you could explain your statement in more depth maybe we could find it.
A general note:  let's all be careful to stick to the issue.  We are trying
to learn about the code of morality that proponents of ""Gay Rights"" initiatives
subscribe to.

At first sight, this claim seems obviously correct, but when you look
a little deeper, you find that it is hard to determine what are the
bounds on ""ability to do the job"".  If the presence of a heavy smoker
(good at the job) impairs the ability of a co-worker to do the job,
is this grounds for at least separating the two, or perhaps to not
hire the smoker?  The overall efficiency of the company may be reduced
as compared to hiring an equally able non-smoker.  Now carry this over
to psychological (and many would say unrealistic) ill effects caused
by prejudice.  Where do you draw the line?  If someone gets very
irritated every time he sees a white person working nearby, and therefore
cannot function properly in the presence of a white co-worker, is this
reason for the firm not to hire whites?  If someone gets so turned-on
by a pretty woman that he can't work properly, is it a reason not to
hire women?  Somewhere, there is a boundary between reasonable and
ridiculous, but simple ""ability to do the job"" cannot be the place.
I don't know where I would put it, but for me it would probably be
reasonable not to hire a particuarly abrasive person for work in
a close-knit team, or a heavy smoker for work in a close environment.
But then, I don't worry about people's sexual preferences or skin
colour, but I do worry about getting upset by smoke or interpersonal
agression.

It doesn't seem at all obvious to me.  Lets cure the disease and not
the symptom.  I agree that people have been unfairly discriminated
against for whatever reason, but that doesn't give us the right to
discriminate against employers.  Why should someone have to hire someone
they don't like?  For whatever reason.  Golly, Why would you want to
go to work for someone who didn't like you?
There are generally two ways to get people to do things.  You can
force them, in which case they don't to a good job and you waste a
lot of energy policeing them, or you can make whatevery it is you
want them to do economical, and make it uneconomical for them not to.
So now the question becomes:  How do we make it uneconomical to
descriminate on the basis of sex, creed, religion, ...?  Not just
employers, but everyone.  This is a much more challenging problem.
Primarily because it already is uneconomical!  (anyone who blindly
descriminates for whatever reasons may be missing a good thing, if
they spend the time to get rid of the person while a competitor
does not then they will have a higher overhead, etc)
The problem is that it is not uneconomical enough, or at least
the social perception of it isn't there.  The problem is that the
society at large agrees with the sterotypes behind the discrimination.
To fix anything else will only obscure the real problem and make
things worse in the long run.
The law you think should ""probably"" exist does in various forms and
it is one of the reasons the original problem still exists.

Fine.  Now, explain to us why you feel your positions are valid, why
people's rights to have the sexuality of their own choosing, the
beliefs of their own choosing, etc., are not ""truly legitimate causes"".
(I think asking for a logical reason behind a position is the quickest
way to silence those who have nothing to say.)
As I've tried to say before, one fights for the rights of a group
oppressed for no good reason, NOT because one wants to ""liberate"" a
particular group, but rather because one wants to make sure that
groups and individuals of any kind will no longer be oppressed for
any reason.  As such, the fact that people seem to have to fight for
these things anew with each generation is the real ""slap in the face""
of the aforementioned people.
(Of course, that's why social reformers of the '60s are the YUPPIES of
today, who find it no longer appropriate to fight for the personal freedoms
of others because they've gotten theirs---along with their Cuisinarts...  )

The specific objection (as I have very *clearly* stated before)
is to legislation of a ""Civil Rights"" flavor that would protect
homosexuals in the same way that racial minorities are protected.
Even more specifically:  hiring/enrollment/membership quotas.
The concept of ""sexual preference"" as minority identification is
completely bogus and should not be afforded the same status as
*real* minority identification.
A person *is* black.  A person *is* hispanic, and so on.  A person
*is not* homosexual.  Homosexuality is an emotional/spiritual disease
which a person can be cured from.  As such, *people* should not be
*forced* to agree that those practicing homosexuality should be accorded

can be cured, and not unchangeable characteristic such as being ""black"".
That position is clearly based on religion and ignorance, and certainly is not
scientific in basis.
One of the basic ideas of sociobiology (which Dave will probably reject out
of hand as ""evolutionary"") is that behavior may be partly determined by the
genes.  Genetic regulatory mechanisms can control the balances of hormones and
other substances in our bodies, which subsequently control our behaviors.
One example, which is not yet fully understood, is schitzophrenia.  Many
schitzophrenics have a chemical imbalance that when treated by drugs,
returns them to normal behavior.  In addition, it's been established that
schitzophrenia is far more likely to occur among those with schiotzophrnics
in their families, which is strong evidence for heritability.  (And I think
that those statistics were controlled for the alternative hypothesis of
learned schitzophrenia.)
This week, I read an article describing differing responses to hormones
between men, women, and homosexuals.  (Note that these differences were in
statistical means, and do not imply any individual would display those
characteristics.)  Thus it is possible that some homosexuality is chemical in
origin, which means that it could also be genetic.  If that's so, then with
the current state of medical technology, genetic homosexuals would be as
""incurable"" as ""blacks"".
This is not inconsistant with reports of ""cures"".  For all we know,
homosexuality displays as much continuity of expression as schitzophrenia:
ranging from none apparent to severe.  This also implies that there are many
heterosexuals out there who could be as easily cured of their heterosexuality,
just as there are many normal people who could be driven to schitzophrenia.
(Apologies to homosexuals for using schitzophrenia (with its bad connotations)
as an analogy to homosexuality.)

assumptions about the nature and cause of homosexuality.","ID9mmqVjRJIJ",11,1984-09-22,-5,1

	Yeah, I suppose it is.  Conversely, it is possible for straights
to renounce their heterosexuality (some religious nuns, priests, brothers,
etc. do this on a regular basis).  Does this renunciation of their sexual
nature make them any less heterosexual??  I don't think so.
	As for an employer's right to treat homosexuality as an
""objectionable behavior,"" it seems to me that he should only treat
this as an objectionable behavior **IF IT INTERFERES WITH THE
EMPLOYEE'S PRODUCTIVITY**!  Many straight couples have marriage
problems, and this is often considered an ""objectionable behavior""
by many groups.  Nevertheless, the employer is not involved unless
the marriage problems start affecting the work produced by the 
employee.

This is the second time I've seen this hatred thing.  Jerry Nowlin
said something similar.  I definitely hate lies and sometimes react
viscerally against them (having seen the disastrous results that 
acceptance of lies has had in my own life and the lives of some of
my friends).  As far as I know this is a virtue.  Let me know if
you can correct me on this.
As for the explanation: what I'm after is a discussion on the
limits of ""tolerance"".  We are talking about two different groups of
people:  those who say that homosexuality is a matter of ""sexual
preference"" and those to whom homosexuality is an abomination.
The problem is this:  how can we accomodate both groups in the
same country?
The ultimate goal of civil rights rhetoric has to be civil
rights legislation.  If you would include homosexuals as a minority
under current civil rights initiatives, then you would penalize
those who wish to discriminate against homosexuals.  Is this
a good thing?  Let me illustrate with a hypothetical example.
Suppose that I am an employer and that the federal government
has just outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual preference.
One of my employees comes out of the closet.  I confront him
about it and he confirms that he definitely engages in homosexual
acts and intends to continue doing so.  Being a caring, loving
person, and not wanting to see him continue in a lie unchallenged
and so confuse himself and others, I immediately fire him.  He goes
to the local Labor Relations Board (or whatever) and reports me.
A few days later a social worker comes out to the office and the
following dialogue happens:
--
""Mr. Brunson, we've just gotten a complaint that you've terminated
an employee, a Mr. Jones, without adequate reason.  Can you explain?""
""Sure, always glad to help the government!  Mr. Jones practices
homosexuality.  I found out about it and fired him!""
""Mr. Brunson, it is my duty to advise you that unless you reinstate
Mr. Jones immediately, you are subject to [lawsuits, fines, whatever].
Will you comply?""
""Not until he *repents*.""
""Ahh, I see.""  [scribbles something in a notebook and leaves]

Suppose I refuse to sell my home to homosexuals?  Suppose I work in
a government agency and refuse to award contracts to homosexual
businessmen?  Would you have me ""educated"" about ""tolerance"" in
counseling sessions?  That won't work.  I've already had 16 years
of that kind of ""education"" and haven't learned the lesson yet.
Here's the issue:  do you advocate federal legislation/mandates/whatever
that would recognize homosexuals as a protected minority.  Why?  What
specifically do you propose?  How will you simultaneously protect those
who obstinately refuse to accept your concept of ""tolerance""?

This is not the issue, by your own example.  What we are talking about
is essential civil rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and upheld
by the supreme court.  There are lots of people in this world whose
activities I dislike;  Nazis, Moonies, prostelytizing right-wing Chris-
tians, wife-beaters, people who rip articles out of library periodicals,
jaywalkers, creationists, trekkies and people who post to multiple
newsgroups to name a few.  It is my right to dislike them, but it is
not my right to abridge their rights as members of this society because
of that dislike.
I don't believe anyone, but you, is talking about giving gays
""protected minority"" status in the legal sense of the word.  Minority
quotas, contract obligations and so forth are *your* Phyllis Shlaflyisms
designed to conjure meaningless spectres in others minds.  A lie is
a lie not only when it is about fact, but when it is about potential.

Step one: Ask those who consider homosexuality an ""abomination"" to
to explain their position.
Step two: If, after long discussion, they have insulted, ridiculed,
and derided homosexuals, but can offer *no* meaningful explanation,
then we conclude that these are hateful, ignorant, backward people,
and that gays do, in fact, need legal protection from them.
You, Mr. Brunson, have insulted, ridiculed, and derided:

Under no circumstances could our government penalize anyone for wishing to

The crucial point is abuse of power.  The same way you should not fire someone
for being black, Jewish, or a Democrat, if that doesn't concern the job.
Don't forget, people can be Jewish or Democrats by choice.  If you belong to

I have three problems with this argument. (BTW, I have reasonable faith in
the truth of evolution.)  First of all, I have serious doubts about the
right of sociobiologists to make claims about behavior as complex as 
homosexuality.  The so-called science is simply to poorly developed; most
of the statements made on its behalf are essentially religion.
Be that as it may, I do admit that some behavioral disorders have chemical
and/or structural causes in the brain.  Schitzophrenia, however, is not
sufficiently like homosexuality to enable me to use it in an analogy.
Schitzophrenia is essentially a breakdown of personality itself, and is
thus fundamentally different from homosexuality or hyperactivity.
Besides, if homosexuality DOES have organic causes, shouldn't we be trying
to find a cure?  (only 1/2 :-))
Finally, there is always one cure for sexual disorders: celebacy.  
Remember that Jesus said, ""If your right hand offends you, cut it off.""
Obviously, he doesn't mean for christians to practice self-mutilation,
(if he were, I think the neck would be the place to start on most of us)
rather, he is saying to do something about one's behavioral problems,
even as far as avoidance of the situation entirely.

I must confess ignorance here.  I must say that it would do my heart
good to know that such bigots would burn in our ""secular hell"" (jail
or fines) as well as in the hereafter.
An interesting issue arises from the fundamentalists' concentration
upon ""homosexual behavior"".  If a gay person doesn't have sex with
other gay people, can that person be ""gay""?  I would argue most
strongly ""Yes.""  When you get right down to it, ""homosexual behavior""
in the Kinsey/M&J sense is really a small part of life (for most of

another man.  Rather, a large component of gay life revolves around
life with one's SO and the friendships and acquaintanceships one forms
day-to-day.  (Just like everyone else; the fate of net.motss is to
constantly rehash the obvious.)  Indeed, though I would not prefer it
for myself, it is entirely possible to be celibate and gay.  Where do

and bigoted views on homosexuality.  There is another point I'd
like to make:  Even if Dave convinced me that homosexuality was
wrong, I would still consider his position reprehensible.
Deciding what is right and what is wrong is terribly difficult.
However, once a society, or an individual, decides what it will
consider wrong, I believe it's easy enough to divide those acts
considered wrong into two categories:
	Type 0 wrongness:  an act which is wrong because it hurts
	another person.
	Type 1 wrongness: an act which is wrong because it hurts
	oneself, or [for the religious] because it is unpleasing
	to God.
I believe it is the responsibility of a society to protect its
members from type 0 wrongness.  At the same time, I believe it
is the right of the individual to do what he damn well pleases
(even if he hurts himself), as long as he doesn't wrongly hurt
others.  In fact, I would go as far as to say:
	It is a type 0 wrongness to prevent someone from engaging
	in a type 1 wrongness, or to persecute or harass them for
	engaging in a type 1 wrongness.
This is a cornerstone of my personal ethics, and I think it is
a fundamental principle of our political system.  This doesn't
mean that the principle hasn't been violated -- there are laws
agaist victimless crimes, such as prostitution, in many states
-- but I still believe the principle underlies our government,
as it should.
So, Dave, even if you did convince me that homosexuality was a
""sin"", it would still be a type 1 wrongness, and thus, none of
your God damn business.  I would still consider it wrong (type
0 wrongness, the serious stuff) for you to persecute or harass
gays, to refuse to employ or sell your house to one, etc.  You
would still be dead wrong in my book (and, by my understanding
of it, in that Book you keep talking about).

        I am against quotas, skin color notwithstanding.  To me,
they simply imply ""Well, youre not REALLY good enough to get this
position, but the government says we have to let 'your kind' in,
so, ..."".  Neither do I believe that homosexuals should be a
""protected"" (whatever that means) minority.  If you start saying
that 10% of all jobs should go to gays/women/people of
color/whatever, you have just about guaranteed that NO MORE THAN
10% of all jobs will go to gays/women/people of color/whatever. 
	My proposition is that race, color, sexual orientation or

By ignoring the latter group completely, since there is no reason why
a group who simply believes something to be ""an abomination"" has the
right to impose that view on other people who believe otherwise, and
no reason why they should be ""accommodated"".  As witnessed by their
failure to offer logical reasons (""I don't like it"" doesn't count.
Except to them.  An example of the limits of *their* tolerance.)

The ultimate goal of ""civil rights rhetoric"" is to have a world in which
NO ONE is discriminated against for arbitrary malicious reasons (which is
the only type of reason that has been offered).  The ultimate goal is
not to include any group onto a list of ""protected minorities"", but rather
to eradicate malicious discrimination by people who simply don't like
certain classes of people for whatever empty reason.  In a world in which
people continue to behave with the level of consideration for other human
beings that would make Jesus Christ spin in his grave, why shouldn't you
be penalized for your malice towards groups of people who think and behave
differently than you do?

Apparently you also haven't learned the lesson of tolerance from that
book you keep telling the rest of us to read.  All you've gotten out
of it is a springboard for showing your supposedly higher level of
morality by decreeing that all should (must) follow it.

There's no need to protect such people.  If they refuse to offer consideration
to other human beings, why show any special extra consideration to them?
It's just like your examples:  blacks have no choice but to be black, so
you can't blame them for being black (blame them???), so it's wrong to
discriminate against them; on the other hand, homosexuals (and I guess
Jews, too, eh?) choose to be what they are, so it's OK to be intolerant of
them.  By your logic, you choose to be intolerant of other people for no
good reason, thus it's OK to discriminate against you.

Dave, I think that if this was the second time (and this will be the third)
that you have seen someone call you a hatefull person you had better start
looking into yourself for the reasons why.  I hate lies too.  So much in
fact that I would rather risk putting myself into big trouble than to tell
a ""little white lie"".  You, however, go far beyond that.  I agree that to
dislike lying would be virtuous.  But to start passing laws against people
whom you think are living a lie is definitely NOT virtuous.

Two comments.  First, you totally ignore the group that believes that that
homosexuality is not a matter of choice, but of being.  Second, how can we
NOT accomodate both groups of people. Or do you want to begin treating the
homosexual people as the Jews were treated in Germany.

Good for us!  That is exactly what we need.  Strong laws to prohibit
discrimination against EVERYONE.  Even ""Kingdom sorts of guys"".  Yes, Dave,
I would even want to prohibit discrimination against someone who wants to
discriminate against others.

Jesus said, ""If your right hand offends *YOU*, cut it off.""  Doesn't say
anything about if it offends anyone else. :-) Just a quip, but maybe a
serious one.  You still have to prove that it is a behavioural problem.  So
far, no one has.  Maybe no one will.  I kind of doubt it.  In any case, if
you can prove that it is a behavioral problem, DO IT NOW!

The first paragraph is a misunderstanding.  I did not say that sociobiology has
explained homosexuality.  I'm sorry if I what I wrote could be construed that
way.  My purpose was to show that there could be naturalistic explanations
for homosexuality, as well as theological ones, and to chide Brunson for
being so careless (benefit of the doubt :-)) as to ignore that possibility.
However, schizophrenia is not necessarily a ""breakdown"" of some ""normal""
condition.  ""Normal"" is an abstraction with no real existence.  Allow me to
present an analogy.  Many of us are familiar with behavioral game theory which
shows that there can be an equilibrium between hawks, doves, bluffers and
various other strategic behavioral classes.  Is any one of those classes
abnormal, a breakdown of another, inferior, or bad?  No.  The most you can say
about any one would be that it is a minority.  The same MAY be true of various
degrees of schizophrenia.  Anthropologists have studied schizophrenia in
numerous cultures, and have found some societal niches in which schizophrenics
perform quite well as people with much status (for example as shamans.)
The scientific attitude towards schizophrenia should be descriptive, rather
than prescriptive.  It may not be right to inflict a cure on what could be an
adaptive survival strategy, just as it may not be right to sterilize people
who don't fit some other societally determined standards.
The same is true of homosexuality.  It is neither inherently bad, nor
disadvantageous, nor a disease.  Nor should ""cures"" be inflicted without the
consent of the individual, either by laws or social pressure from bigots.","SxN3iPzy-DQJ",10,1984-09-25,-17,1

Actually, I checked up on this one... This is a synoptic passage shared by

In both places the context is quite plain.

Well, it's clearly behavior, so I'll have to assume you mean the problem
part.  As far as those who are not christians are concerned, for now I
make no claims at all.  For those who are, the Bible seems rather clear.

Being a Lutheran, I can't resist quoting brother Martin, in the context of
some discussion over what precise actions were or were not sinful:
   ""Sin boldly!  But believe and rejoice in Christ more boldly still!""
In a more serious vein:  Many Christians believe that there is little
difference (from a ""sin"" point of view) between performing a sinful action
and *desiring* to perform a sinful action.  Remember, of course, that I'm
pretty clearly in the ""saved by grace thru faith"" camp, so cataloging sins
seems rather unimportant to me.

Thank you for your interest in this topic!!  There isn't enough
time to respond to each comment, but I'll handle what I can.  
Anyone who wants to help out is more than welcome.
First of all, let me assure everyone that I recognize the folly
of trying to teach morality to those not interested in a covenant
relationship with the Creator.  No one can accuse me of the non-
biblical position of ""trying to convert"" anyone, and these postings
are definitely no exception.
Secondly let me point out that there is definitely an attempt
to legislate civil rights for homosexuals.  In fact, there is
a bill before congress which addresses just this issue -- HR 427.
There's probably not much chance of it getting very far.  This
time.
Many misconceptions can be cleared up by a second hypothetical
example:
Once again I am an employer.  This time there are two applicants
for one position.  A statement of requirements is on file in my
personnel department.  Requirements for the position include a
Master's degree in Computer Science/Engineering and at least
two years of experience in designing, say, CAD/CAM applications.
One of the applicants, Howard Jones, is a homosexual who exactly
fills the requirements.  The other is Susan Cohen, an observant
Jew who meets the education requrement but lacks the necessary
experience.  Some will say ""how do you know about their non-job
related backgrounds""?  Okay.  Let's say I went to school with 
Howard Jones.  When he showed up for the interview I asked him,
""hey Howard, you still a homo?""  And he said, ""Sure am, Dave.""
Susan Cohen wore a Star-of-David pin to her interview which
provoked a discussion of, among other things, her family life,
synagogues in the area where she might like to attend if she
gets the job and so forth.
Now there are two things happening here.  First of all, being
a Bible-believer, I am intensely interested in opportunities
to take advantage of the provision for goys under Abraham's
covenant -- ""I will bless them that bless you..."".  If Susan
wants the job, I will tend to favor her for it because she is
a practicing jew.  
Secondly, Howard calls himself a ""Christian"" and attends the
local Metropolitan Community Church.  This, as you all know,
is an abomination to me.
So who will I hire?  Susan Cohen, of course.  The way I look
at it, I'd have to be out of my mind to hire Howard over Susan
no matter how much experience Howard has or how immediately
he could be making money for me.
How will the state judge this?  Howard definitely had the paper
qualifications.  Susan didn't.  Howard was definitely discriminated
against because he is a homosexual.  Susan definitely received
extra consideration beyond her qualifications because she is
jewish.
Once again, when the state investigator comes knocking at my
door, I will unhesitatingly say, ""Yes, Howard had the better
qualifications.  I *discriminated* against him.""
So, some folks would have had me thrown in jail for the last
episode of discrimination.  How about this one?

And my proposition is that race, color, *most* creeds should be
irrelevant, but not ""sexual preference"".  Discrimination against
persons because they are black or jewish or arab is an abomination, just
as granting homosexuals, adulterers, and other aberrant individuals
""rights"" is an abomination.

I am not advocating discrimination against blacks, jews, or democrats.
If I were a black, jew, or democrat, I would be outraged by this
association.  This is an example of a tactic that is frequently used
by the homosexual activist.  The public is supposed to be so conditioned
that the word ""discrimination"" triggers a Pavlovian association with Hitler,
concentration camps, persecution of Jews.  Jews should be indignant
at being placed in the same fraternal brotherhood of sufferers as
homosexuals.  Are they?  I'd be interested to know.

There is no problem with where to draw the line.  I draw it at civil rights
legislation for homosexuals.  The rest of your paranoia is unjustified.

Jail, no -- it's a civil offense, carrying civil penalties.  And yes, I do
think you should be liable under the proposed statute.  Absolutely, no
question about it -- this is exactly the kind of behavior the law is
intended to prevent.  (I should note parenthetically that your ""preference""
for a Jew, for you own religious reasons, is quite likely in violation of
existing laws against religious discrimination.  And I should also note that
as a Jew, I find your patronizing attitude *extremely* offensive.)

Any interviews in which the personal private lives of the interviewees
are discussed are unethical.  People have won lawsuits based on claims
that they were not hired because the interviewer discussed personal or
religious beliefs, et al.  An ethical job interviewer would never concern
him/herself with such matters during an interview.  The rest of your scenario
has already been discussed, pointing out your empty basis for your
discrimination and your contemptible patronizing attitude toward Jews.

And my proposition is that race, color, creeds should be irrelevant,
but not ""being named Brunson"".  Discrimination against persons based on
race or creed is an abomination, but discrimination against people named
Brunson (or those with other aberrant names) is OK.  My proposition is just
as worthy of consideration as yours:  it's equally arbitrary, equally
vacuous.  (By the way, which creeds were you leaving out?  The non-Judaeo/
Christian ones?)

This one isn't (though Arndt and Martillo might argue about my Jewishness).
(At times like this I always recall, and always forget the name of, the
clergyman who said ""First they came for... but I was not... so I didn't speak
up"".  Of course I also forget the text itself.  If someone would be so kind...)
The ""tactic"" being engaged in is YOURS:  the crux of your argument is that
YOU don't like homosexuals, thus you have a right to discriminate against
them.  The word, discrimination, when taken to its logical extreme (as it

I take ""personally harmful"" to mean that YOU judge it to be harmful to
a given individual because YOU find it repugnant.  If you liked eating
chocolate, and I (and others) found that practice repugnant, and
discriminated against you for engaging in it, would that make sense?
(I know, not a good way to phrase a question directed at an Arndt clone.)

No doubt about it.  If jail is the legal punishment for discrimination you
should probably be there already.  It sounds like you want the right to decide
who and what you can discriminate against.  Why should you have that right?
Do you know better than all the rest of us?  This country is run according to
laws that are written and passed by the officials we elect.  Why don't you
send your nasty articles to your congressman and senators.  You have a right
to your opinion, and you also have the right to voice it.  They let the KKK
hold marches and pass out literature.  That doesn't make their opinions
correct either.
One issue I'd like to get some feedback on relates to this hiring scenario.
What if the actual qualifications of the 2 applicants were equal.  Would the
interviewer then have the right to use sexual preference as the basis for the
hiring decision?  What group should this be discussed in?  It has no
particularly religious overtones, but I'm not that familiar with alternate
groups.

As a former cohabitater, I guess David would probably lump me in his group of
aberrant individuals.  I'm married now, all nice and legal.  That doesn't mean
I've ""repented"".  I just made my commitment in a different way this time.  Why
can't he get it through his head that homosexuals are just expressing their
sexuality in a different way than he does.  Why should they repent?
David Brunson really amazes me.  I think he's a closet homosexual atheist out
to discredit christianity.  Nobody could really be that mixed up.

Precisely!  That's why it is important to gather this sort of information --
so that citizens can be aware of exactly what is meant by ""Gay Rights"".
We now know that it means throwing people in jail for refusing to grant
jobs to homosexuals.  Now citizens can make an informed decision whether
this is the sort of legislation they want and can instruct their elected
representatives accordingly.

Well, first of all, the articles aren't nasty.  I point out to my
detractors once again that I have never resorted to personally abusive
comments.  What's more, I don't feel the slightest inclination to do
so now, either!!  Even after the many undeserved insulting remarks that
have been directed at me lately.  Secondly, that's not a bad suggestion!!
I mean, now that I know what the Gay activists are really after, I have
a ""special interest"" in opposing them!  Does anyone know of groups opposing
Gay Rights that I could support?  Or better yet -- missionary efforts
that have proven successful?

The goal of advancing minority rights is NOT to make lists of protected
minorities (""OK, discriminating against blacks, Jews, ... that's wrong because
they fought and paid their dues and are now 'legitimate minorities',  but
discriminating against gays, atheists, people named Brunson, that should be
allowed!""), but rather to ensure that unjust persecution and discrimination
against *any* group of people is agreed upon as WRONG.  It's that simple.

The point, however, is still  that  you  have  discriminated

We are talking about homosexuals.  NOT Jews, NOT socialists, and NOT
people who eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  There are STILL
sodomy laws on the books in most civilized states (talking about the U.S.).
What we are talking about is a proposed radical shift in U.S. public
policy.  It is currently NOT illegal to discriminate against homosexuals.
Some are proposing to make discrimination against homosexuals illegal.
Currently homosexuality is illegal and discrimination against homosexuality
is legal.  HR-427 and other proposed initiatives seek to make homosexuality
legal and discrimination against homosexuality illegal.

Whoa!  Homosexuality does not constitute prima facie evidence for sodomy
nor is sodomy a practice restricted to gays.  Granted that specific forms
of sexual behavior may be against the law and that you have the right to
discriminate against those who break the law, it is incumbent upon *you*
to prove the violation.  Innocence without proof of guilt is a right that
everyone enjoys, fortunately, though it appears you would like to change
that.
(You would be amazed at the sexual practices that are against the law in
North Carolina -- as a monogamous happily married person I regularly violate
state statutes.  Fortunately only Jesse Helms is interested in prosecuting
these sorts of things.)

The title of this article represents the oft-heard rationale of those who
resist social change:  why not leave things as they are?  The corollary to
this occurs in times when social progress is growing, and the changes that
this progress causes requires some adjustment on the part of other people
who formerly didn't have bother thinking about the people their behavior
was affecting.  That corollary is:  why don't we go back to the old ways
when things were better, when everyone knew their place, etc.?
1.  What Brunson calls a warped morality is, in fact, a morality prescribing
	the right of all human beings to live as they please, provided that
	their actions do not interfere with or violate another person's rights.
	Brunson may argue that HIS right to interfere in other people's lives
	is being violated (his right to discriminate).  Yet that is clearly
	not one of the ""rights"" this very simple, minimal and rational morality
	includes.  Is there anyone who finds fault with such a morality?  Why?
2.  If a society is based on the exploitation/oppression/dehumanization/
	ignoring of an element(s) of that society, on some arbitrary basis
	(""They're not human, they're slaves.""  ""They don't believe in the
	REAL god.""  ""They do *weird* things."" ""... thus they can't vote,
	can't expect equal treatment, etc.""), then the sudden/gradual
	realization of the equalness/humanity of that element, that group
	of people, is going to cause changes in the society.  (""You mean
	we won't have slaves to work in our fields anymore?"" ""You mean *they*
	are going to working in *our* company?""  ""You mean I have to work/live
	with/near one of *them*?"", etc.)  If a tenet of the societal morality
	is truly to treat all people equally, even those who formerly were
	not, then the changes are to be expected.  A fact of life.
3.  I'd still like to see the difference between Jews/blacks/women(""legitimate""
	minorities) and homosexuals (non-""legitimate"" minorities).  I'd also
	like to know what Brunson's notion of a protected minority is.  If
	all people are to be treated equally and not discriminated against,
	why are certain groups considered ""protected""?
4.  The battle cry ""let's get things back to the way they were"", an appeal
	to those affected negatively by these changes, is most often a call
	to fascism and repression.  Getting back to the old days will of
	necessity mean getting back to (actively) repressing the newly 
	emancipated groups of people.  Such people are not satisfied until
	they can repress just about everyone other than themselves.  Then there
	are those like that clergyman who said ""First they came for the gays,
	but I was not gay, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the Jews,
	but I was not a Jew, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the
	communists, but I was not a communist, so I didn't speak up; ... then
	they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.""  (BAD
	PARAPHRASE---could someone please send me the original text and the
	name of the speaker)

Actaully, it depends somewhat on how the constitution is interpreted as
to waether or not it is legal to discriminate against anyone!  And I'm glad
to say that those few states that still have sodomy laws are having them
struck down by the courts if they won't get their own house in order.
Currently Texas is in court over the issue.

Your religion should be practiced everywhere, why do you not follow it?
Remember Jesus's ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""?  Why do you not practice
the second most important commandment, according to the benchmark of the
man you try to pattern your life after.

You are a bigot and a hypocrate.  You should not be allowed to let the effects
of the former ruin other people's lives.  You should think about the latter
and ask if Jesus wants his church run on that basis.

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much
of this article was taken.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

issues to label what he wrote ""stupid in the extreme"".

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays. 
Important disclaimer from you is ""gay men"". Right, women don't fit
in the hypothesis so nicely.

First, comments on net.motss (what does motss stand for, anyway?):  I don't
like the idea of a gay newsgroup on the network, but I suppose there is not
a lot I can do about it.  I do believe that every man is entitled to have
and express his own opinion (free speech), so long as it does not hurt
anybody else.  The proponents of this newsgroup are in error here;
they probably believe their activities are innocuous and not harming
anyone.  This is not true;  C.S. Lewis gives an excellent dissertation on
human moralities in his book ""Mere Christianity"" (which I can heartily
recommend).  Humans cannot properly address human morality without concerning
themselves with the morality of the group.  This argument is of course based on
the proposition that homosexuality is wrong (a sin).
        On ""the end of the world"":  I thought the idea humorous.  I
personally believe that the end of the world will be soon, but 2001?  The
Bible tells us that NO ONE knows that exact date of the return of Jesus, and
that we should live our lives day-to-day as if he were coming tomorrow.
I am fascinated reading stories of some religions predicting Christ's return,
dressing up in white robes, ascending some mountain only to be disillusioned
the next morning.  The story is not an uncommon one.
        I wondered why the originator of the survey left out ""the beast"" in
his survey?  Did he think it was not connected to the end of the world, or
was he just not interested?

   The statement that homosexuality is a sin can be easily proved by picking
up any Bible (don't ask me to quote, it's in there).  What I believe you
are REALLY asking is, ""Why is homosexuality wrong?""
   No, I will not respond with ""Because it is a sin."" There have been
many arguments pro and con, but if you want my reasons, here they are:
   1.  It is not natural.  The process of evolution has determined that
to procreate the species a man and a woman are required.  Homosexuality
defeats this purpose.
 
   2.  Sex in the United States has been blown all out of proportion.  If
you went to a country where people read dirty books consisting of pictures
of food, went to x-rated pictures that consisted of nothing but food, told
dirty ""food"" jokes, and got strange pleasure of doing unnatural things with
food, wouldn't you say that the country's craving for food was unnatural?
The cravings (or lusts) go beyond that which is required to insure the human
body operates properly.  This statement encompasses much more than homosexuality
but certainly includes it.  (This argument has been used by another famous
Christian).","TQ6V3JBwaE0J",11,1983-11-02,4,1

I find  this logic rather interesting.  It seems to read:
    ""Homosexulity is a sin because it is unnatural (ie. defeats the purpose of
    evolution).""
    1)  (side point) I don't recall the bible talking about evolution, as
        natural or unnatural; creationists certainly could not use this
        logic!
    2)  (main point) The implication seems to be that anything that prevents
        procreation is a sin.  If you're a Catholic I suppose this is actually
        some of the points that the Church wants you to beleive.  On the other
        hand, if that is the case, why don't priests have lots of children?
        Is it a sin to be a bachelor? a spinister? sterile?  Furthermore,
        where in the defintion of homosexuality does it say that being gay
        means never being heterosexual?  Clearly being homosexual is not
        related to procreation, but one can hardly argue that it ""defeats
        this purpose""!

produce progeny is not as logical as you suppose. There are numerous
counter-examples. If a women and/or a man are sterile, does this imply
that sex between them is wrong? They certainly cannot produce
children. We can not turn to the other animals for our sense of
naturalness either. Homosexuality has been documented in other
animals therefore animals with no sense of right or wrong are
doing unnatural things.

sexuality is absurd. There are numerous things that man does that

I agree entirely.  Furthermore, evolution requires that the man and woman be
unclothed at the time of procreation, so the wearing of clothing is
unnatural.  Also, watching television does not directly aid the procreation
of the species, so it is unnatural.  In fact, come to think of it, most

Now, wait, Dave.  Christianity is unnatural, since it does not directly
further the procreation of the species.  By a consistent application of your
principle of unnaturality, Christianity is completely unnatural, as is
speech (except pick-up lines), reading, throwing garbage in cans, and
turning on the lights.  None of them directly further procreation, so they
are unnatural.
I am glad to hear that you are willing to debate logically.  When do you
plan to start?  You could begin by admitting that your prejudice against
homosexuality is older than your silly argument for its ""unnaturality"".

We need a definition of ""natural"" here. If you use ""natural"" as in ""found
in nature"" then there is no way that you can claim that homosexuality
is ""unnatural"" since there are a LOT of animals who practise it.
If you start saying that ""homosexuality is not a good thing because
people are supposed to procreate"" (and procreation is natural) then
you have just managed to condemn priests and other members of religious
groups who believe that it is their duty *not* to procreate. Not to
mention those of us who aren't having any children because the world
has enough children already.
I think the ""natural"" argument is entirely specious.

that it was observed in an experiment with overcrowding. The rats were
given all the food they needed, but a limited amount of space. Result
was pregnant rats re-absorbing their babies (this happens in rabbits
too, come to think of it) or eating them as they're born, an increase
in the number of violent encounters, an increase in the injury
inflicted in these encounters, and an increase in homosexuality (which
however, had been present all along). I think one might be able to
draw parallels too our current crowded situation in cities. One
hypothesis is that homosexuality is a natural and NEEDED method of
birth control.

unnaturality of homosexuality and other behaviors is incorrect.  However,
the way it is incorrect is not what Dave suggests.  It is incorrect because
I got sucked into the discussion without backing off and examining the
definitions.  I'll now rectify that flaw.
Nothing that is perceivable by human beings is unnatural.  Nature is the
universe; we live in the universe, therefore all our actions and perceptions
are natural, whether they be feeding a waif or nuking a continent.  The
whole ""natural vs. unnatural"" worldview implies a purposiveness to nature
separate from the purposes of humans, and says that they can be in conflict;
but nature has no purpose -- it simply exists.  Nothing is unnatural because
everything is in nature; we couldn't do anything unnatural if we tried.
Given this, the whole argument about the naturality and unnaturality of
various events is absurd, and I will not continue it, except to point out
that by Dave's standards, contraception is unnatural, as are all forms of
foreplay.
The question remains of homosexuality's moral legitimacy.  If Dave wants to
talk about this, fine.  However, I refuse to accept any action as moral
which restricts the liberty of a person who does not cause hurt or harm to
any other person, but simply does not follow a certain standard.  In other
words, there is no such thing as a ""victimless crime"" in my morality -- if
it is victimless, it is not a crime; however, restricting the
""perpetrator's"" liberty because of the action IS a crime.  Homosexuality
therefore carries no moral stigma.
Here is an astounding statement from Dave:
	I think I stated the unnatural aspect of homosexuality as an
	opinion;  I didn't think I would draw this much flak.
Right.  You deliberately spread hatred and prejudice, and expect that the
fact that it is your opinion lets you off the hook.  Suppose someone posted
an article saying that they thought it was unnatural for blacks to be
anything but slaves, that is, that free blacks are unnatural.  I'd come down
just as hard on them as you, and the fact that it was their opinion would
not deter me in the least.  If you spread hatred and prejudice, you deserve
to be publicly castigated, and that's what I'm doing, and will continue to
do if you do not stop.
Here's another winner from the same source:
	...you proceed on the assumption that I am prejudiced toward
	homosexuals.  This may or may not be true (and would be
	difficult to prove/disprove anyway), but what has that got to
	do with starting a logical argument?
You stated no basic principles from which your beliefs are drawn, but if I
am to carry on logical discussion, I must know what those principles are.
My assertion was a challenge to you to provide some basic principles behind
your arguments, since otherwise I would have no alternative but to believe
that they are rooted in prejudice.  You have said nothing to contradict this
latter possibility, and therefore I will continue to believe it.
More than that, though, I asked you to admit this because in so doing you
would come closer to understanding that any argument that comes after its
conclusions are formulated is immediately suspect.  I hardly think I need to
support this statement; if a million examples of false arguments that turned
out to be rationalizations do not spring to your mind when I say this, you
have not had sufficient contact with logical discussion to be able to carry
on such a discussion.  In other words, admit that you began by disliking
homosexuality, and then came up with your ""unnaturality"" argument; you may
then come to realize that the argument is a rationalization, and therefore
highly suspect.

It was my great-grandfather's farm, but that is not the point. Your
whole argument does not wash. There are human societies that have yet
to connect sex with babies. (I heard a lecture on one group of them
last week -- they are in New Guinea.) Do you really expect that the
rats do? 
However, it really outlines what it is that some people mean by
""natural"". They mean that if you aren't going ""rah rah procreate!""
all the time, then your sex is unnatural. By that definition, I don't
know a single heterosexual couple that counts as natural.
Now where could this idea, not that the humans *ought* to be thinking
of sex-as-for-procreation-only (an idea which isn't even in favour
with the middle-of-the road Catholics in Toronto!), but that the
animals *already are* have come from? Let me think.
I may be wrong, but my hunch is that it comes from Genesis 1:22
-- the old ""be fruitful and multiply bit"".  
If this is so, then you have just defined ""natural"" to mean ""in
accordance with my interpretation of the Christian Bible"". This
sure isn't my definiton of the word natural, and I am sure that it
is not the one that most people use.
I have a smaller definiton of ""natural"" than Tim Maroney's (for
instance, if there were no wild colonies of rats that exhibited
that lab behaviour, I would be willing to concede that that was not
natural behaviour for rats) but not so small as to consist of 
somebody else' interpretation of his Holy Book. 
(By the way, lemmings exhibit homosexual behaviour every 7 (I think)
years, under overcrowded situations. Of course they are the same
animals that every seven years ""swarm"" <much like bees> to
form new colonies due to overpopulation. In lemming swarms, there
is a lot of dinners provided for the Arctic foxes and wolves,
and a lot of lemmings simply dive into the ocean and start swimming for
the other side. They drown, leading people to beliefs of lemming
mass suicides.)
Now. If you want to argue about ""correspondance to my interpretaion
of Holy Book X"", that is fine. BUT -- not in net.motss, which
is read by a lot of people who don't care about ""Holy Book X"".
And consider that what you are actually arguing about is not the
NATURALNESS of homosexuality, but the MORALITY of homosexuality.

Interesting what people choose to pick on.  Note the behavior described:
	indiscriminant sexual activity without contraception or prophylaxis
Note the claim:
	people who do such things are more prone, per individual, to sexually
	transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy and more likely to bring
	about illegitimacy or abortion.
Now you may take issue with these claims, but if you do you are taking issue
with the whole rationale for compulsatory sex education in the schools.  You
are also taking issue with the claims of the people who manufacture foams and
condoms.
In this instance the burden of proof is on those who dispute the statement;
the claim is one that we now act on as well-established.
If, on the other hand, you are saying that this behavior is not promoted by
pornography, or by *some* pornogrpahy, or that *no* pornogrpahy promotes this
behavior, we have a topic for discussion.
Now, what do you mean by ``promote''?  Do you mean bring about, or advertise
on behalf of?  Or have you some other definition?

Fair enough.  Here are the ones that you attribute to me.  Most are fair

In particular, a drastic change in the type and amount of sexually explicit
material, as well as an increase in the amount of research data and the amount
of evidence in the form of testimony.  In addition, two other national
commissions (one Canadian, one British) have asked similar questions and come
to conclusions different from those that Nixon's commission came to, one in
the mid 70s and one in 1985.
The conclusions of the 1970 study may or may not be valid; only an examination
of what we now know can determine that.  This Commission undertook such an
examination.
> o In discussing porn in general it is relevant to bring up an isolated
>   example of one porn film involving an actual rape on camera.
Yes.  In examining *any* activity, it is relevant to bring up an example,
particularly one as extreme and heinous as a rape on film, sold and viewed
by millions of people (making them accessories).
The question you should ask is whether this incident is representative of the
sex industry, or whether it has occurred more than once.  The answer to the
first is not absolutely resolved by the report, which calls for more study,
and involvement of law enforcement experts.  On the basis of testimony, the
answer to the second is yes.  And there is evidence, somewhat weaker, that
these are not isolated cases.  The evidence is strong enough to urge immediate
study, and to urge that measures be taken that will make such abuse more
difficult to accomplish, if this can be done without serious infringement of
individual liberties, and if this can be done within the framework of the
current interpretation of the Constitution.
> o ""Scientific data is of no import to constitutional law""
Not quite what was said (which necessarily responds to the context).
Statistical studies are not the only stuff of which constitutional law is made,
or even the principle component.  Constitutional Law speaks of rights and
rules, of legal principles that are not statistical in nature, but absolute or
relative to each other.  Constitutional law existed long before anyone knew how
to write protocols for social and behavioral sciences studies, and it achieved
some pretty notable things.  Also a few flops, most of which have been fixed.
Scientific data is of use in determining fact, not in applying principles,
except insofar as those principles rest upon claims which can be examined
through such data.
> o The results of certain studies are frightening.
Yes.  Would you like references for the studies and experiments?  As I say
below, I cannot type them all in.  A selection would have to do.
> o There exist large numbers of people who could ""quite reasonably"" be said
>   to be ""victims of pornography and the industry that surrounds it"".
Depends what you mean by large numbers.  If you mean 40 million people, the
answer is probably no.  If you mean tens of thousands, the answer may be yes.
The commission calls for further study.  But if the witnesses who testified
are representative, we may be talking about numbers in the hundreds of
thousands or low millions.
If one thousand people a year are degraded, humiliated, and left with a threat
of future humiliation of themselves and their loved ones because of what they
did on camera to avoid starvation, can we justify it for the erotic stimulation
of a few?  By few, let us say less than 15 percent of the adult population.
> o There is a ""real toll in human misery"" all around us, which we (who 
>   argue with you) are pointedly ignoring.
``All around''?  Does it matter whether it is all around you or concentrated
in one area if you are patronizing an industry whose activity that has this
result?  Yes, the testimony before the Commission, by itself, strongly suggests
that such misery has resulted and may result on a regular basis.
> o It is an emergency.
Wouldn't you consider *any* situation that results in the harms alleged to
be an urgent situation?
In particular, the sexual abuse of children by people who collect, exchange,
and sell photographs of that abuse, and who use such photographs to facilitate
the abuse of more children warrants immediate attention.
> o (Something about ""psychological violence"", but not defined well enough
>   to include here.  Please clarify.)
Such violence includes the cases documented in testimony of women who were
abused physically or psychologically by ``partners'' who sought to have them
duplicate the things viewed on film or in photographs.  It includes women who
have been harassed by men who have filled their traditionally male workplace
with images of women in sexually accessible postures.  In a less definite but
no less damaging way, it includes women who are viewed as objects for the
pleasure of men around them.
The list of victims includes the men who do these things.  To say that they
are sick is much like blaming accidents on drivers:  guardrails, barriers, and
seatbelts help reduce fatalities and serious injuries.  The lack of these
things need not be the direct cause of the accident.
Yes, we *do* need more studies to determine the extent of some of the harms.
But this does not mean that some of them are not well documented.  And others
are offensive simply on egalitarian grounds:  ``When your rape is entertainment
your worthlessness is absolute'' (Dworkin).  Yes, you may disagree with Ms.
Dworkin, but *if* the presentation of rape, date rape, etc, *is* entertainment,
then the relative esteem in which we hold men and women is certainly in
question, especially when the women depicted are shown as ultimately acceeding
to the assualt and calling for more.  The only questions are if such materials
are viewed as entertainment and how large the effect is.
Such materials are viewed as entertainment by some; the Commission found that
quite a bit was available.  Whether it is what *you* like or not is a
different question.  As to the magnitude of the effect: examine the studies
which showed that subjects (college-age males) who viewed such materials were
less likely to bring a conviction, or even believe the victim's testimony, in
a rape trial.  Note that the volunteer subjects are screened to avoid
deliberately subjecting anyone with possibly psychotic tendencies to situations
which might trigger harmful behavior.
> o Studies (which ones, by name, please.  And in the context this seemed to

Some of it has been posted.  If your goal is to establish the reliability of
what the Commission said or to question my interpretation of it, why not get
the $9.95 copy which will soon become available?  Then you will not have the
possiblity of error in my transcription.  But I will transcribe some of the
references and conclusions based thereupon if you like.
> o It is OK to repeatedly refer to victims, w/o establishing the meaning or
>   scope of this group.		*
Over 100 such victims spoke before the Commission.  Many others who considered
themselves victims were interviewed by the Commission's staff.  Given the sense
of shame surrounding such victimization, it would appear that these would be a
small minority of the actual pool of victims in the cities in which hearings
were held.  Very few of these were offenders (whose testimony may well be
self-serving).  Of those sex offenders who testified or provided statements,
many testified to having been abused as children in the same way that they
abused their victims, and this abuse often involved sexually explicit materials
used in the manners that Dr. Deitz outlined.  Such repetition, as adults, of
abuse received as children is well documented in other areas of child abuse,
and it is becoming established in patterns of sexual abuse as well.
Indeed, if victims of abuse that is aided by pornogrpahy themselves become
offenders because of the damage they suffered, their victims are, in a limited
sense, victims of the original material.
I believe that the victims that Dr. Deitz wrote of represent reasonably well
the categories of non-offender victims that spoke before the Commission.  I
cannot possibly type in all of the testimony.  Nor would the backbone sites
appreciate it if I could.
> o The commission could not possibly have been ""stacked"" and still disagreed
>   so much.
It could not have been stacked with people whose agenda was a blanket
condemnation of all sexually explicit material.  It is possible, given the fact
that the Commissioners were unpaid, that they did approach the subject with
concerns -- concerns which may very well have been based in harms that they had
personally witnessed.  In at least one case, this is true.
The openmindedness with which the Commission approached its job is, I think,
evidenced in their struggles even to define the term ``pornography''.  It is
evidenced in the fact that, excluding explicitly pedophile material, the
Commission voted by a thin margin to recommend the lifting of *all*
restrictions against the written word (as opposed to photographic or cinema-
tographic depictions)  And by the fact that they invited people who might
reasonably oppose restrictive laws to appear before them.  A few did.  Most
such individuals who were invited declined to appear.
But *every* significant disagreement that arose between the Commissioners
argues against the claim that they were merely playing out a fixed agenda.
And every such disagreement, every dissenting opinion, every close vote
reduces the likelyhood that such agendas, had they been present, would have
been the final determining factor in the Commission's findings and
recommendations.

What is at issue is the assumption that the omission of certain
behaviors from books and films *promotes* attitudes which would lead to
the omission of those behaviors in real life. Now this assumption is, in
general, demonstrably false. For example, in real life, the requirement
that police detectives be accountable for their actions makes for a
great deal of tedious paperwork. This paperwork in almost never
depicted, and seldom mentioned, in a typical detective story. Does this
mean that detective stories promote the attitude that accountability is
irrelevant to police work? No: a normal person knows that films and
books, like all art, constitute a *selective* re-creation of reality.
The fact that police paperwork is not depicted in detective stories does
not lead the audience to lessen their expectation that the cops will
remain accountable for their actions, and does not lead the cops to omit
paperwork from their schedule.
Now let us suppose that behaviors required by love, affection, marriage,
procreation, and responsibility are indeed routinely omitted from fuck
films. Does that mean that normal people, who know that films are a
*selective* re-creation of reality, will be led thereby to omit those
behaviors from their own sex lives? I see no reason to suppose that
anything of the sort could be reasonably expected to happen. Indeed,
Dietz's statement would be somewhat puzzling if it were not for the fact
that its author spends most of his time studying violent criminals. Now
some violent criminals are notorious for their inability to distinguish
between reality and fiction; their crimes often resemble verbatim
reproductions of behavior read about in books or seen on the screen.
Dietz's assumption is an example of what we psychologists call the
Psychiatric Fallacy: making generalizations about human behavior on the
basis of clinical experience limited to severely disturbed individuals.
And it is reasonable to assume that Mark selected the most persuasive
excerpt from the commission report, so the rest is likely to be worse.

	Another very important difficulty with this kind of study is
that it fails to distinguish cause and effect. Given that two factors,
A and B are correlated there are ate least three possible *classes* of
reasons. They are:
	1) A causes B, either directly or indirectly
	2) B causes A
	3) some other factor, C, causes both A and B
The Meese Commission jumps straight from A and B are correlated to A
causes B! There are in fact at least two perfectly good models for C
causes both A and B. One is that some environments, such as slums,
generally promote mental health problems, which in turn lead to both
a large demand for pornography and a larger rate of sexual crimes.
Second, since porn is technically illegal everywhere in the US it
might be that it is only sold regularly in areas with genrally poor
law enforcement, where other kinds of crimes are going to be more
common anyway. Actually, I believe a combination of these two is quite
likely, and fully explains the correlation.

Huh? I don't know what your rationale for sex education is, but mine
is simply that understanding sex is important to human development and
education, and is a subject that should be part of the curriculum,
just like math, English, geography, and science... Sex education 
certainly helps lessen the incidence of STDs and unwanted pregnancy
(the latter assumes that contraception is taught), but is no more 
""the whole rationale"" for its inclusion than ""keeping up with the
Soviets"" is for science education.

No, the burden of proof remains on the proponent, Dr. Dietz. Nowhere
in his statement does he attempt to support it. Actually, the
incidence of STDs (certainly untreated STDs) and unwanted pregnancy in
the pornography industry is quite low in both real terms and adjusted
for the rate of sexual conduct. This is rather obvious; sex actors and
actresses are VERY AWARE of STDs, how to prevent and treat them, and
how to prevent/terminate pregnancy. It's their life and livelihood.

Road Runner cartoons are excellent examples of nonviolence....
How about showing them ""Rambo"" or ""Dirty Harry""?

     I take it, then, that the ""patterns of social behavior promoted by
pornography"" were described in a previous section of the report?  Does
pornography in fact advocate ""indiscriminant"" sexual activity?  If not,
what standards of discrimination does it use?  Does pornography promote
the abandonment of contraceptive measures?
     Given the excerpts of the report I've seen (granted, they might be
selective, but holes are holes), I'd have a hard time getting a good grade
on it from any of my profs.

You are saying first that there was one study (actually, experiment) and second
that it was not properly controlled, right?
You haven't read the Report.  From Page 980,
	Are there differences in effects from exposure to violent versus
	non-violent sexually explicit material?  An early study (Malmuth,
	Reisin, and Spinner, 1979) had male and female subjects exposed to
	one of the above stimuli or to a neutral one.  The materials presented
	were pictures from Playboy or Penthouse magazines for the sexual
	exposures and from National Geographic for the neutral exposure.
	Sexually violent depictions included pictures of rape or sadomasochism
	whereas the sexually nonviolent material had no aggressive elements.
	After viewing the material, subjects filled out a mood checklist.
	This was followed ten minutes later by an assessment of reactions to
	rape after the subjects had viewed a videotaped interview with an
	actual rape victim as well as an assessment several days later in an
	ostensibly different study.  Both types of stimuli were found to
	reduce the extent to which subjects perceived that pornography may
	have detrimental effects but neither one affected reactions to rape.
So far, so good, but this is a case where the victim was interviewed, and
allowed to tell her side without interference.  The Report continues:
	Correlational data, on the other hand, showed that sexual arousal to
	the sexually violent depictions were significantly related with a
	self-reported possiblity of engaging in rape.
	Another study (Malamut, Haber, and Feshbach, 1980) examined the effects
	of written depictions of a sexual interaction based on a feature from
	Penthouse magazine and modified to create a violent and nonviolent
	version for male and female subjects.  In this study, males who had
	been exposed to the sexually violent depiction (sadomasochism)
	perceived more favorably a rape depiction that was presented to
	subjects subsequently.  Subjects were found to believe that a higher
	percentage of men would rape if they knew they would not be punished
	and that many women would enjoy being victmized.  Finaly, of the
	fifty-three male subjects, seventeen percent said they personally
	would be likely to act as the rapist under similar conditions.
	Fifty-three percent of these males responded similarly when asked
	the same question if assured they would not be caught.
	In order to draw out the various dimensions in the portrayals of
	sexual violence which might explain the inhibition of sexual
	responsiveness, Malamuth, Heim, and Feshbach (1980) conducted two
	experiments on male and female students.  The first replicated
	earlier findings that normal subjects seem to be less aroused by
	sexual violence than by ``nonviolent erotica.''  A second experiment
	manipulated reactions of the rape victim with one version showing her
	as experiencing an involuntary orgams and no pain.  The second version
	had her experiencing an orgasm with pain.  Both male and female
	subjects were aroused to these depictions, with femals subjects more
	aroused by the orasm with no pain version while the males were more
	aroused by the orgasm with pain stimulus.  The authors postulated in
	this case that under certani conditions, rape depictions can be
	arousing, particularly when the rape victim is shown experiencing
	an orgams during the assault.  According to the authors, subjects may
	have reinterpreted the evens preceding the depiction of the arousal
	so that the rape is now viewed as one that is less coercive and less
	guilt-inducing.
	Three additional studies (Malamuth and Check, 1980a; 1980b; 1983)
	provide further evidence that victim reactons have a significant
	impact on sexual arousal and behavioral intentions.  Results from
	one of these studies showed that both make and femal subjects
	exhibited higher arousal levels when portrayals showed an aroused
	female, regardless of whether the contect was a rape or mutually
	consenting situation.  The second study (Malamuth and Check, 1980a)
	similarly showed that male subjects had higher penile tumenescence
	scores when viewing a victim-aroused rape portrayal compared to a
	portrayal showing victim abhorrence.  Significant correlations were
	also obtained between the reported possibility of engaging in similar
	behavior, sexual arousal to rape depictions, and callous attitudes
	toward rape.
	The effect of sexually violent on attitudes has also been demonstrated
	with male and female subjects reporting a greater acceptance of
	rape myths agter exposure to such material (Malamuth and Check, 1980a;
	Malamuth, Haber and Feshbach, 1980)
	In an attempt to approximate a ``real world'' situation, Malamuth and
	Check (1981) had male and female subjects view full-length features
	as part of a campus cinema showing.  The films --*Swept Away* and
	*The Getaway*-- represented sexually violent fims wheras control
	subjects viewed a non-violent feature film.  Dependent measures were
	obtained after a week in a questionaire presented as a separate
	sexual attitudes survey.  These measures included rape myth acceptance
	measures, measures on the sexual beliefs, measures on the acceptance
	of interpersonal violence as well on adversarial sexual beliefs,
	measures developed by Burt (1980).  Results showed that exposure to
	sexual violence increased male subjects acceptance of interpersonal
	violence against women.  A similar trend, though statistically
	nonsignificant, was found for the acceptance of rape myths.  There were
	nonsignificant tendencies for females in the opposite directions.  In
	addition to the advantage of external validity from the field
	experiment, the problem of demand characteristics in some laboratory
	situations is quite effectively dealt with in this study.

Given the fact that controlled studies *were* done (not by the Commission,
which had not the wherewithall to fund them), with a reasonable attempt to
eliminate the effects which you describe, your ``obvious conclusions about
the scientific motives of the investigators'' may fairly be regarded as
unsubstantiated and unreliable.
Whatever motives you ascribe to Edwin Meese, to Ronald Reagan, or to anyone
else in or around the current Administrations (which obvious conclusions we
may accept or disregard), the people who put together this Report attempted
to put together a survey of testimony and research that would at least stand
basic examination.  If they came into the project with certain experiences
in the field of pornography, organized crime, or sexual exploitation, they
at least attempted to document what they claimed.
Can you do as well?

I stand by my observation that *appropriate controls*, namely controls
differing from the ""pornographic"" stimuli only in the defining
characteristic of ""pornography"" - sexual arousal, according to Mark -
were never done. The ""pornographic"" materials used by Malamuth (et al)
were in fact *violent* as well as pornographic, and the element of
violence is known to be capable of eliciting the reported results *by
itself*, i.e. *even in the absence of sexual arousal*. Moreover,
Malamuth uses a significance level of .05, so that *even with proper
controls* the probability of any single contrast yielding a spuriously
significant result would be .05. The study described above, according
to the Meese commission summary, involved at least 5 contrasts , so the
probability of at least one spuriously significant result is .23, about
one in 4. And this is the *best* of the studies cited by the commission.
Not much to go on, is it now?

Sorry to quote so much, but I think people discussing sexual arousal should at
least spell ""orgasm"" correctly!  (I'll let the other three misspellings pass.)

Are you trying to make the same kind of ""A is associated with B, therefore

It seems to me that except where sex education advocates abortion, the two

It becomes quite obvious that your viewpoint is just as narrow as that that
you impute to the Meese commission.

It isn't so much what you say as how you say it.  Read over that little
bit of prose above and then read some of the gems from the infamous
McCarthy days.  The similarity in tone is frightening.

As soon as anyone starts to tell me arguing something is a waste of time
they are really saying that their minds are closed.
Incidentally:
At this time I personally believe that it is anyone's right to view any
kind of flick their little hearts desire, and for anyone to produce or
act in any kind of production they wish, PROVIDED that no exploitation
or coercion is employed in that production.  I make NO distinction in
this regard as to whether the end result is porn or not.
It is possible that after reading the Meese report I may change my mind.
In the meantime I continue to support the Second Ammendment of the
constitution, which ends ""  .. the right of the people to keep and bear
Arms, SHALL NOT BE ABRIDGED.""
I suspect I might someday need my little arsenal, not against the well-
meaning but misguided souls on the right whom I feared not so many years
ago, but against the well-meaning but equally bigoted liberals of the
type who are currently posting so much to the net.

Which of the studies are you referring to?  Or are you referring to all of
them?  I will agree (as if anyone had thought to mention it) that the presence
of one name on several different studies may reduce the independence of the
studies, but it does not mean that one can be considered when the others are
ignored.
If you are saying that there has been too little research in this area, you
will get no argument from the Commission and no argument from me.  If you are
saying that there has been *nothing* shown, I think you are pushing a point a
little too hard; at the very least, the studies show a reason for concern and
for more extensive study.  They certainly do not indicate that we should
abandon two centuries of legislative and judicial tradition for the sake of a
``sexual revolution'' not yet a quarter of a century old.
And that seems to be the question that the net.singles groups revolves around:
should over 200 years of law, in which both the legislative and judicial
branches have a hand, be discarded on a whim that is just a few years old and
that already shows some signs (if not yet conclusive evidence) of causing
harm?
We have seen how ``progress'' has polluted our air and our water with
chemicals and our hearing with noise.  After our experiences with these
things, oughtn't we go slow when there is enough evidence to show that harm
is at least possible, if not entirely unlikely?  Especially where the subject
is one as personal and private as human sexuality where we are *known* to have
vulnerabilities and interconnections, as yet poorly understood, with other
behaviour?
(I can hear the resounding chorus of *no*!)  Given the involvement of new
technologies (photography and cinematography/electronic video) doesn't it
make sense to take it easy?  And given the testimony of individuals who
claim to have been harmed, along with both observation by the commission
and testimony by law enforcement officials regarding the unhealthy conditions
in retail outlets, isn't there reason enough to at least consider bringing
the industry under public scrutiny?
Given the harms (disputed by a very few) of child pornography, coupled with
the existance, well documented by law enforcement, of networks to distribute
such materials, isn't there adequate cause to close loopholes in the current
interstate commerce laws and bring such activities under the RICO act where
they are done for profit?
If you believe that the evidence is not yet adequate to base policy on, and
you fail to search for more evidence when the evidence that is there makes
a strong suggestion, then you are showing your bias.
If you take the incompleteness of evidence in one area to mean that evidence
in another area may be ignored, you are likewise demonstrating a mixture of
prejudice and arrogance.
Since you have apparently worked with Malamuth's data before (have you, in
fact?), what have you to say on the other studies?
Meanwhile, I missed a chance to post some of the references provided in the
Report.  I should apologize.  When I get the time again, I will post them;
probably will post every third in the list.

There are different kinds of pornography, even the Meese commission saw

	And if the answer to the first question is yes you should ask
one more question, that is whether such activity is due to the current
illegal status of pornography or to something intrinsic in pornography
itself. The optimal solution depends critically on the answer to this
last question.

	Certainly, but I consider this a seperate problem from
pornography, I call it child abuse. These people would be abusing
children with or without photography! They are just using currently
available technology to support their habit. Certainly a crack-down on
pornography would not stop them, just drive them further underground.

	This is a problem, but it has been around *far* longer than
pornography has. In fact, if anything, it is *less* prevalent today
than it was in the past. Check out the accepted attitudes of men
towards women, say 40 years ago, or 100 years ago. I think women were
even more degraded then than they are now. So, where is the harm? The
problem you cite has nothing to do with pornography, it comes from old
cultural values that have not yet been totally eliminated.

	No, there is another question: Which came first, the low
esteem in which the men and women are held or the viewing of such
things as entertainment. It is quite possible, even likely, that it is
the low esteem that has permitted the perception of violence as
entertainment, rather than the other way around. If so, the problem is
how to re-educate the public so that people are viewed in a higher
light. Then the desire to watch degrading entertainment will go away
all by itself, with no need for censorship.

I do not see this behavior described in the above excerpt.  Is that
described elsewhere in the report, and defined as the 'social behavior
promoted by pornography'?  Or is that your personal opinion?  I guess
it doesn't matter, since even if it's described in the report, it's
just *someone else's* personal opinion.

Just what are 'such things'?  I imagine this also is defined elsewhere
in the report.

I would take issue with the contention that the use of erotica implies
a lack of sex education, or a penchant for not using contraceptives.
Does the report claim such a connection?  Are there any statistics on
this?  ...I guess not since they didn't need research.
The problem with this 'report' is that (from what I've seen so far) is
that it's merely the concensus opinion of a group of biased
individuals, and should be viewed as such.

Perhaps you should keep in mind that the original reason this went to the
Supreme Court in the first place was for the illegality of ORAL SEX!  The
two people charged under the Georgia law were males having oral sex.  The
Georgia law that was upheld was not an anal sex law against homosexuals, it
was an oral and/or anal sex law against ANYONE!
This includes two people of the opposite sex that are married.
In this light, does it change your opinion of the ruling?  Do you wish the
government to certify ok and not ok sexual habits?  
p.s.  If you are so concerned about AIDS, and other sexually transmitted
diseases, the Lesbian population seems to have the least amount of risk in
transmitting or contracting any of these things.  However, their activies
are also illegal under these laws.  You'll have to find another
justification for the Supreme Court's decision.  It certainly wasn't health
related.

       Heterosexuals also engage in oral sex (which is legally
considered to be ""sodomy"") for obvious reasons. From a logical
standpoint, the issue should be:
     1. Is sodomy harmful?
     2. If is is, does the government have the right to legislate against
        sodomy in order to protect society from its harmful effects?
  For example, murder is harmful and society should be protected. Cigarette
smoking is harmful, but individuals are permitted to make their own decision.
But sodomy is not even harmful (in fact ""oral sex"" is a safe method for birth
control). Therefore, the second question is not relevant.
        Frankly, I'm stunned that such blatent puritanical 
laws are being upheld by the supreme court. Logic has been cast aside
by the reactionary backlash.  
        Of course, thinking has never been one of their better skills. 
Hate and pride have locked their minds into a vicious, irrational state.

OK.  Based on what?  What you like, or what I like?  Why does what *you*
like matter more than what I like?  And just what the hell is it your
business anyway?
Perhaps you favor majority rule?  Then you would lose on this one.  Even
so, I really don't think you would want majority rule deciding these sort
of questions.  What if a law was passed to decide if Nick Flor should be
allowed to even have sex or not?  Tell me why if that wouldn't bother you
or not?
On which date is it OK to first kiss?  According to you, and apparently
the Supreme Court, it is perfectly proper for Georgia to regulate that.
What else would you like the government to certify?  Hair length?  Beards?
Your brand of coffee?  What TV shows you are allowed to watch?  How many
hours of sleep you get a night?
One of the things that makes this country GREAT, Nick, is something I

     1)  I'm not convinced we need lines drawn (lines are so inflexible).
     2)  Is it the business of the government to draw those lines?
     3)  Is it the business of the government to address the question of
moral decay at all?
     4)  Are you going to start harking back to the ""good old days"" when

     I find your opinion on this matter as scary as any boegy man that ever
crawled out of a closet. Your willing to allow the government to dictate to
you, ( and I should point out, everyone around you), how you should conduct
your moral behavior. Even worse, you advocate that these same people should
be allowed to dictate to *me*. That's pretty scary, when you look at the 
adminstrations that have spawned such illuminaries of our time like Joesph
McCarthy, Edward Wallace, Lyndon LaRouche, and other ""free thinkers"" of our
age.

     Who's morals? Granted that the moral fiber of America has shifted from the
Juedo-Christian-Puritan mold, but that's not necessarily unhealthy. You seem
to feel that the government is here to protect you, take care of you, see that
the ""real world"" outside is kept at arm's length. I don't have any problem with
that, just keep me out of it. I've watched and read of too many examples of 
what happens to a society which gives up it's freedoms, any freedoms, even 
those you don't particulary find pleasant, or those that fit your own moral 
code.
     One day they take away your right to practice certain sexual positions, 
then it's sexual behavior, then it's ""believe in us, because we tell you to,""
then it's ""it was for your own good"". C'mon Nick, your mother raised you to be 
a thinking person, able to make intelligent decisions about your life. Let
the rest of us have the same privilage, without the need of ""surrogate parents""
watching our every move.

Well now, what exactly is moral decay?  Popularity of diverse 
sexual practices is evidence of moral decay?  Do you have any evidence
that oral sex weakens someones morals?  (of course if you believe
that oral sex is inherently immoral you've satisfied this circularly,
but then you'll have to convince me that oral sex is inherently immoral).
How about laws that are unenforced or almost unenforcable?  Laws
that many people break routinely?  Laws with apparently no logical 
basis?  These laws contribute towards lack of respect for the
law in general.  Once somebody regards one ridiculous law as a joke,
how much more does it take to spread this attitude to law in general?
Or what about ridiculous lawsuits, say suing the makers of a ladder
because they didn't specifically state that you should be sure it
is planted securely?  
Seems to me that THIS contributes to ""moral decay"".

Yes, I've noticed.  *YOUR* moral decay is obvious, for instance.  It used to
be that moral people recognized that government is (at best) an amoral
institution, and can't be trusted to make moral decisions of any sort.
Do the phrases Teapot Dome, Watergate, or Senate page boys mean anything to
you?
Regardless of whether it's morally correct to wish to legislate morality,
it's clearly wrong to give government the power to legislate morality when
it's obvious they'll abuse the power.
Furthermore, *IF* you believe this country is in a state of moral decay, and
that the ""truly moral"" people are in the minority, hasn't it occurred to you
that legislators will get more mileage pandering to the decadent majority
than the embattled minority, and that the stick you give them could be used
to beat *YOU* over the head?

Can you make fish swim in the air by outlawing swimming in water? How can
you make a man who is sexually interested ONLY in other men NOT want to
have sex with other men? What the anti-sodomy law will do is to push gay
men back into oscurity, make them less willing to come out and indirectly
promote the spread of AIDS by making people be afraid of seeking help and
advice.

I am just wondering: don't heterosexual Georgians ever have oral and anal 
sex? I am heterosexual and according to the Georgia's anti-sodomy law, I am
a hardened sodomite! Seriously, folks, the line HAS to be drawn somewhere.
I think that line should be the ""bedroom door"" (figuratively speaking). It 
is NOBODY's business what I do with another conscenting adult of any sex
as long as no lasting physical harm is done (yes, altho' I do not practice
and am not at all thrilled by S&M and B&D, I think  people who like that
kind of stuff should be allowed to practice it -- with conscenting partners).
Another thought. What if Gov't decided to outlaw sex et al, or restrict sexual
practices to exclusively homosexual ones. How would all of you, pro-anti-sodomy
law people, feel about THAT?

I'll certainly agree with Mikki that as long as it's private and everyone
concerned is a consenting adult it's no one else's business.  However,
unless things have changed alot since I was in college oral sex can 
spread diseases.  As oral sex became more popular some forms of VD which
use to occur only in the crotch area began appearing around the lips
and inside people's mouths.  I understood that dentists can also get
a form of what use to be VD on there hands from people who have gotten
it in their mouths.  There was a big deal made about this for a short
time and a push by the health dept. and the dental societies to get
dentists to wear gloves and for people to stop seeing dentists who
don't wear gloves.

An interesting point, and I thought about this for a while.  My guess is the
laws were set down to protect women in a time when it was easier for men to
take advantage of them.  One hundred or two hundred years ago women had little
recourse if they suffered abuse at the hands of their husbands.  I see polygamy
laws as one means of offering protection.  Were our society truly free of
sexual discrimination, I would see no reason to keep such laws on the books,
as all parties could make the decision to enter polygamous relationships on
truly free will.

     I don't see how monogamy is going to protect a woman from abusive
husbands.  Now with polygamy, the wives could all gang up on him.
     You can develop a strong argument for polygamy based on the protectionist
attitudes toward women common in just about any period of history.  Women need
a man to provide protection and status.  Women are incapable of handling their
own financial affairs (remember, I'm pretending to be a protectionist.  THIS
IS NOT REALLY ME!  Okay?).  Some women manage to escape male protection -
widows and single women who have no male guardians.  The more women a man
marries, the more he protects.  Fewer poor widows and destitute spinsters
become a financial burden on the community, church, state, whatever.  (The
term spinster came about because unmarried women in England circa 1600, I
think, were required by law to do so many hours of spinning per day - to keep
them out of trouble and make sure they were productive members of socity.)
If you have a male-dominated society, it kind of makes sense to have the male
dominate as many females as he can, no?

I remember reading in the newspaper that a heterosexual couple had
originally participated in the challenge to the sodomy law.  Their

there was virtually no chance they would ever be prosecuted for sodomy.

This doesn't raise the question of equal protection because the homosexuals
involved in the Hardwick case were NOT prosecuted.  The charges against
them involving sodomy were DROPPED before they ever got to the police
station.... They took the case to court anyway.  The basis for the swing
vote on teh Supreme Court (I don't remember which judge) was that the 
law has never been and will never be prosecuted.

>The strings that some women wear on the beach nowadays 
>only do one thing...tease
This is the  second  article  of  this  general  nature  I've  seen  posted
recently.  Since  others  have already posted appropriate flames in reply I
thought I'd have a  try  at  analyzing  the  underlying  attitude  implied.
Perhaps the original posters can gain some insights while recovering in the
burn ward.
Come, let us reason together ...
It's been my experience that very few women deliberately set out  to  tease
and  frustrate men for the fun of it.  When a man feels teased it's usually
because a woman isn't responding to him  in  the  manner  _he_  thinks  she
should.  The  logic  seems  to run something to the effect of ""I'm sexually
attracted to you {for whatever reason},  therefore  you  are  obligated  to
fulfill  my  fantasy."".  There's  also  some ego-protection going on in the
form of ""There's nothing wrong with me, so your rejection of me must be  an
act designed to tease."".
Reasoning like the above can lead an otherwise intelligent man to  conclude
he's  being  teased  because an attractive woman is wearing beach attire at
the beach.
I've learned to avoid the  pain  and  frustration  of  these  fallacies  by
keeping one simple principle in mind:
     _Any_ woman has the right to say ""NO"" and mean it _any  time  she
     wants  to_  and  _need  not  justify_  her  reasons for doing so.
     Period.  Paragraph.
Any man who refuses to accept and honor this principle is no better than  a
common rapist.
If a man thinks he's been or being teased he has a perfect right  to  leave
the  situation  and  have nothing further to do with the woman in question.
He _does not_ have _any_ right to force his attentions on her or in any way
try to make her behave as he thinks she should.
Now a thought experiment for the male readers:
Imagine you are 5'2"" tall and weigh 100 lbs.  You are an attractive man and
dress accordingly.  While sunning on the beach, in your bikini swim suit, a
6'4"", 200 lb. homosexual man walks  up  and  tries  to  pick  you  up.  You
politely  decline  but  he  refuses  to  leave  and begins to show signs of
irritation at your continued rejections.  He finally leaves in a huff,  and
half  an hour later the same thing happens with a different man.  This goes
on all the time you're at the beach, every time your at the beach.
Ladies:  Is the above a fair analogy?

Imagine you closely resemble someone rich and/or famous.  Wherever you go
women mistake you for this other person.  Most of the time they stay at a
distance and just watch you. Several times a week someone will talk to
you for a while and when they realize you are not who they thought you were
they will leave. Occasionally someone will realize you are not who they 
thought you were but will stay around anyway because they like *you* as a
person.
There seems to be something that makes the resemblance more pronounced when
you are sunning yourself at the beach.  
One day you are at a public beach (since you don't have your own) and a 
woman comes over and talks to you.  You really just feel like reading and
give her rather short answers.  You do not consider it polite to start off
the conversation with ""I'm not who you think I am."" After a while she 
realizes that you are not who she thought you were and she goes away
angry. She resents the fact that you are masquerading as a rich and/or
famous person. ...
Specific Disclaimer:  The characters in this example are ficticious. Any
	              resemblance to real men or women is coincidental.
		      Most of the people I know do not act this way.

Well, from the male's point of view, if you hang around waiting for
a woman to initiate a relationship with you, you are in for being very
lonely. The only way I have found that works is to be very aggressive
at meeting women, and being persistent. I am not aggressive by nature,
I have had to learn it because I dislike being lonely even less.
By the way, women usually say 'no' to me the first time I ask them out,
but if I try again later, frequently they are more positive.","2X1ofrqRt5QJ",21,1986-02-03,-5,1

You're making a lot of (ignorant, biased, sexist) assumptions here.
You're equating scanty dress with wantonness, which is not only
demonstrably false, but laughably subject to fashion.  It happens
that the socially acceptable minimum in bathing attire has stayed
nearly constant for a long time -- the mid-sixties at least -- at
practically nothing.  This leaves little room to use the old ""anyone
wearing fewer than n yards of cloth is a whore"" argument.  It's a
stupid argument, anyway.
She probably doesn't want your attention.  If she did, she wouldn't
snap at you.

A jock strap is underwear, not a swimsuit.  Try to come up with valid
analogies.  You didn't say she was at the beach in her underwear.

You have absolutely no reason to believe that she's trying to attract
men.  Your assumption that ""less clothing=promiscuous tramp"" is the
only basis for any of your speculations, and the assumption is silly.

Not quite.  Let's suppose, in addition, that your trunks can be undone
at the back, and you have done so in order to get a nice even tan.
Now, maybe, this analogy is a little fairer.

      Now I get it!  David must find female backs every bit as sexually
stimulating and erotic as he imagines homosexuals find male buttocks.  Why
else would he think that his changed analogy is better?

Well, of the last 6 significant relationships all six were either partially
(and very actively) or fully initiated by women. And it wasn't my sparkling
personality (mine is rotten) or my charm (I have none) or my sex appeal
(I have very little) or my great looks (I doubt even a few million dollars will

Ray, old pal! I thought you left the net for good, but alas! you are back to
enertain us with your unique and disarming sense of Born-Again humor,
pearls of Fundamentalist wisdom and under-ripe intelligence!
How 'bout this scenario, Ray? You are sitting on the beach suntanning wearing
a 3-piece suite and a tie...  Naw, even YOU are not THAT weird and dumb!
And now, for a few inflamed comments about your stand on the ""Beach Harrassment""
issue:
I wonder if you spontaneously ejaculate every time you see a naked woman...
Or any naked flesh for that matter! What's wrong with human bodies, Ray?
Why's it that a strip of flesh MUST be construed by you as a sexual innuendo?
Are you so stupid that you can't tell when a woman is paying SPECIAL attention
to you and when she'd rather you left her alone? After all if she was interested
in your company she would have probably come up to you herself...
""Dressing less accordingly"".... Your mediocre mind as always has noted only
the surface...
What if the girl in question was naked? Like on a nude beach? Or topless, like
on  a European beach? What if you walk down the street and run into a naked
woman -- is your first reaction going to be ""She probably wants to fuck me!""???
Do you unzip your pantin public places and let your penis hang out (if you have
it, that is!) as a sign that you are available and looking for a fuck?!
And WHAT'S WRONG WITH FISH-NET beach-wear?! Or does a sight of a woman's breast
give you a heart attack, Ray?
Then again, as I remember from the rape discussions last fall, a sight of a
sexually attractive woman is enough to cloud your mind, demolish your morals,
annihilate your self-control and threaten to turn you into a fuck-crazed
monster-rapist!

As a matter of fact... no! I just treat women like I treat all other people
and am interested in them as people in general and individuals in particular,
not as sex objects. And if I have a sexual interest -- I make it unambiguously
known. That usually removes a lot of strain out of a relationship.
BTW, from this point on this discussion seems to lead to net.singles follow-ups
so if anyone wants to take initiative.... ( I don't read net.singles so am
not setting follow-up to go there -- I like reading flames!).

I used the term ""singles bar"" in a generic sense to indicate a place
where people go to meet members of the opposite sex.  Since I have been
married for eighteen years and I don't drink alcohol, I am totally
ignorant of the situation in real ""singles bars"".  Perhaps I used
a bad example?

No, I got the point the first time.  I just think that the sort of
non-objective thinking that produces concepts such as ``harrassment
is in the eyes of the harassee'' is cruel.  If you actually
go around thinking this way, then I suggest you change your way of
thinking, and as fast as you can, because you are probably being
extremely hard on the people around you in your life.  They are in
the unenviable position of having to read your mind before they can
determine whether their efforts are going to be considered humourous
or harrassment. 
This is one heavy load to expect hald the human race to carry.  Face
it, the world is full of lonely men who would dearly like to meet
a member of the opposite sex with whom they can get along.  Remarks
like this only serves to let them know that they have to go at it
blind.  What one woman will call ``humourous'' another will call
``harrassment''.  When some women say ``Leave me alone.'' they mean,
``buzz off, buster, I'm not interested'' -- and others mean ``if you
work real hard, I will be nice to you, but I'm going to make you work
very hard, because I am shy, or interested in having you prove yourself
to me or...''  It is all very unappetising.    It makes you want to stay 
home and hack on your editor, and give up on meeting women altogether.
Luckily for those lonely women out there, most guys are lonely enough
to run through the mill again and again, still looking for someone they
can understand well enough to like, and eventually love.  (Others,
of course, give up on like altogether.  They fall in love on the bus,
in class, at work, on the street...this is a hard way to live, but
I suspect better than concluding that the other half of the race is
too irrational to go out with -- after all, they are bound to run into
a good one after a while.)
Can't you see that it is *really*, *really*, *rotten* to hand this
out to people at large?  Most readers of this list (like most men,
surprise!) have no interest in harrassing women on the beach.
Meeting them, yes. Taking to them, yes. Persuing the acquaintance,
maybe. Something more than that? also maybe.  But almost nobody gets up
in the morning and says ``Hey! Let's go down to the beach and harrass
some women!!'' 
So the readers of this list are waiting, with bated breath, to figure
out how it is that you go down to the beach, meet women, and don't
harrass them.  They have a nice strong interest in this.  And what
do they get?  They get told that the whole situation is hopeless.
If random-female doesn't like the way you look, or the way you dress,
or whatever, she will consider your opening line harrassment.  If
she likes you, then she will not.
Seems rather hard on the ego of poor old average-guy-wanting-to-meet
-someone-on-the-beach.  No matter what you do, sucker, I can still
get you for harrassment!  I find this really, really, really mean.
All I can hope is that the problem is that, for all the talk of
women's liberation, the people who say such things haven't ever
taken the big step of approaching men to whom they are attracted and
waiting to see if they are going to get an ego-crushing rejection.
(Which probably won't happen.  Men, being well aware of this as a big
source of anxiety try to let you down gently, when they try to let
you down at all.  Most of the men which I have asked out have been
so overwhelmed at the ego-stroke of having *somebody else* ask *them* 
out that that is enough to make them accept.  Things will even out
over time, as more women ask more men out, but right now things are
pretty unbalanced.)
In the meantime, I still see this horrible double-standard. There is
all this talk about ``insensitive men'' and ``sensitive caring women''
but I wonder -- are those women only caring about other women?  Labelling
men as harrassers, without providing objective standards for harrassment
goes pretty high on my ``insensitive'' list.  Perhaps the problem is
that many women cannot see beyond ``he said something which I didn't
like'' to ``I wonder why he said that?''  It is easy to scream
harrassment whenever you don't get what you want, but hardly fair.
Never attribute to malice what is easily explained by stupidity, and
remember -- while you are not obliged to like every man that comes
around, the ones you don't like aren't obliged to live in a hole
either.  And you can't find their very existence harrassing -- just
as they can't find your existence harrassing.
ps -- for any men who have managed to read this far.  Try real hard
	to forget the notion that if a woman rejects you it is because
	you have ULTIMATE LOSER scribbled across your face in a way
	only she can read.  It's hard, like swallowing elephants, but
	true.  keep on trucking.  The first ten rejections hurt like
	hell.  the next ten also hurt. From then on, it is not so
	bad.  the trick is to get this far. (Big hint -- you won't
	get this far if all you do is hack on your editor...)

were complete truth in it, then would this discussion be going on in the
first place?  No sarcasm...just an elaboratory question.

Do you take bigotry lessons, Frank?  I knew you were a sexist, and
now you demonstrate your hostility to foreigners.
Of course you have a right to your opinions.  Who else would want
them?

More cheers!  Ladies, this is how it really is.  Yes, there are some men
who have the sensitivity of a stone, but I believe the vast majority of
us are real peaple with real sensitivity, just as you would have us
believe all women are (they aren't, but again, I believe the vast majority
ARE sensitive to others feelings).

Yes, but for many of us (yes, I include myself, if you haven't guessed

As a woman who goes out alone, because I like to do things OTHER than stay

I might wear something which has a minimal amount of fabric to it.  This 
would NOT be an effort to attract people. It would be ME staying cool.

Once again, I must disagree, in that you are not expressing just how TWISTED
this type of logic is.  If people are to be safe when they wish to go to any
type of public place, EVERYOME should understand that how you LOOK is to make
yourself happy.  Not to solicit the attention of others.
So many rapists have used that type of logic to justify their lack of self-
control.

I have a question:  Why are you all taking the extreme approaches to this
issue?  Are *all* the guys that approach a woman on the beach Neanderthalls?
Do *all* women approached feel threatened/nauseated?  Please just remember 
that sometimes, the guy appeals to the woman, or goes away when politely
told to.  I mean, there are some guys out there that walk upright without
dragging their knuckles on the ground ..... 
No, I'm not trying to re-start the sensitivity issue again.

You should realize that what you see (for the most part) on the network
are the most outspoken and extremist Christians.  (Being outspoken and
holding extreme views often go hand in hand.)  I gave up on net.religion.*
a long time ago because the extreme views (on both sides) just didn't
represent my more moderate views, and there didn't seem to be much
room for moderates there.
In my humble opinion, the same seems to be holding true for net.women
-- much of what gets posted here is both outspoken and extreme.  I
have seen moderate subjects get twisted so quickly to one or the other
extremes that the ""moderate"" poster winds up being flamed from both
sides.  Result?  The ground in between the two extremes becomes a
""no-person's land"", and it can wind up looking like the net is
populated by a bunch of rabid other-sex-haters.

Admittedly, there has been a lot of bad done in the name of Religion (not
just Christianity).  It doesn't follow, though, that that bad is inherent
in the religion it is done in the name of.  If you look at just the bad
that is done and none of the good, you're not being fair.  Christianity
has also been responsible for many relief efforts for places such as
Ethiopia and India, in many cases long before there was much public
awareness of any problem in those areas.  Christianity is also
responsible for a lot of hospitals and a lot of missions where ""street
people"" are given a chance to get off the streets and back into
society.  Throughout the Dark Ages, Christianity was responsible for
preserving knowledge and learning.  Science was greatly advanced
by Christians who wanted to discover how God had set up the universe
(e.g. - Sir Isaac Newton).

If that is how you view Christianity, your attitude towards it is
perfectly understandable.  I would abhor such a travesty as that.
However, my view of Christianity is somewhat different from that.
At the core of it is the teachings of ""the dead man on a stick"", who
encouraged aiding the poor, the sick, the disabled.  He taught peace,
love, goodwill towards others -- not just friends, but even enemies.
Not only did he teach these things, he lived them.  And for that he
was killed.  The reason for the *symbolic* drinking of his blood and
eating of his flesh is to keep reminding us of his teachings and his
life, and to encourage us to follow his example.  I won't say anything
with regard to miracles, resurrection, and other such things that seem
to offend many people -- those are things that you really have to come
to your own conclusions about.  As to the various ""religious trappings""
that you have from denomination to denomination, and even church to
church, they vary widely and you shouldn't make any generalizations
about Christianity based on those trappings.

I agree with Peter. When I was 20, I could go 20 hours and then, literally lose
my eyesight. This is 1 hour after my ears started ringing. Toxins build up and
mess up the works. Now, I am 29 and I can go 18 hours before gibbering inco-
herently. I have had food poisoning many times and the effects of no sleep
are similar (to me). I feel poisoned. Dating is definitely out of the question
when I can't see, hear or digest my dinner. When you are down-to-the-bone tired
sleep is *definitely* more fun than sex.

Hi Chris.  How you doing?  Write to me and tell me what globetek is.
I agree with you that life is full of context sensitive things.  My
point of contention is over ``if I don't like it, then it is
harrassment''.  Harrassment is serious stuff -- that somebody you think
is unattractive is attracted to you is inconvenient, but in no way
that serious.  I guess I am here for purity of language, more than
anything.  It is hard enough to communicate with people as it is
without having the meanings of words slip out from under you as you
speak.  A certain amount of linguistic change happens all the time,
but that does not mean that ``more is better''  and we should all
plunge headlong into 1984 where people cannot communicate because
all the words are too overloaded -- and more words are disappearing
every year.
That some people are going to get upset when perfectly good and reasonable
people approach them, I can understand.  But if they can't tell the
difference between ``I'm upset'' and ``I am being harrassed'' then
they have a very serious problem.  After all, sexual harrassment is
the sort of thing that you sue people for.  But you don't sue people
because they are attracted to you and you find them unnattractive.
But if people can't keep it straight in their mind what harrassment
is, and mistake it for being upset ,then there are going to be a lot
of unneccesary lawsuits...

Nope -- he is upset.  Now if you are in a conspiracy with the other 17
people to drive him up the wall, you are harrassing him -- otherwise,
he is just upset. Unfortunate, yes. Upset, yes. With good cause -- maybe.
But you haven't harrassed him.  
>(Now, as to whether it's *reasonable* or not for him to feel harassed by

But that *is* the question.  That is why I asked for an objective
standard for harrassment -- not for ``feeling harrassed'' -- but for
actually harrassing people.

Some psychologists say men are making up for moms and female schoolteachers

Anthropologists claim that the mystery of menstruation and pregnancy
made men feel a little out of place with the Powers of the
Universe and thus they assauged their fear and un-ease via bonding rituals.
If you believe bonding rituals don't exist, visit a men's club or
stand on Wall Street and look at the uniforms men wear. Women are learning
to blend in by following the rules of the club (grey suits and non-feminine
haircuts).Read Lionel Tiger on male bonding.
When we all lived on farms, sexism was not an issue. Men and women ate and
had shelter and some clothes. With the Industrial Revolution, a trend called
""The Cult of Domesticity"" began to separate the roles of men and women in
production. A woman's place was in the home and Dad went to work. What we
see with ladies wearing sneakers and grey suits is the Female March Back into
productivity. Since technology is different, rules are different and that's
why everyone is upset and confused. No big deal. Eventually, companies will
lose a lot of their masculine flavor and get into ""human mode"" (daycare,
relaxed communication betwixt M and F, etc.). Do I sound optimistic. I am.

You've got to be kidding.  Have you ever heard of rape and wife-beating?
Have you ever read what Freud said about women?  Have you ever seen the
way women are portrayed in popular entertainment?
There are so many examples that it would be impossible to list them all.
Sexism is part of the air that we breathe.

What choice do they have?  Honestly, Seth, you are grasping at straws.
And even if your simplistic analysis were true, how would that justify
the situation?  After all, humans have lived under tyrannical monarchs
for thousands of years.  Many do even today.  Does that make it right?
Why would men want to put women in a subservient role?  Heck, men
usually want to put other *men* in a subservient role.
Your error, Seth, is in the assertion that feminists believe that
the men and women are, or even started off, ""equal"".  The obvious
biological differences led to obvious differences in social roles.
The--well I should say *A*--feminist position is that many of these
role differences are no longer necessary, if they indeed ever were.

In the current era, in societies where physical strength is not

Hey shithead! You're not a male feminist, you're an idiot whatever the hell
sex you are. Don't lump yourself together with other men. The men out here
don't get down on their hands and knees and ask their wife to strap on the
10"" dildo, as I have no doubt that you do. While your woman is getting into
the fudge-packing and you're squealing like a pig in your high pitched voice,
and yelling 'Shut up, you worthless wimp, or you're going to lick the dildo
again!', there are men out here who go through life with no such insecurities
as you seem to have- and women also.

How about encouraging girls to go into low paying professions like
teaching and nursing? Discouraging them from showing their
intelligence, and keeping them away from math? Indoctrinating them
with the idea that marriage is more important than career? Failing
to provide child-care so they can work after having a child?

     A related theory is that, around the time of the advent of
written history, warrior cultures became dominant by conquering
other cultures by physical force.  Although some of these cultures
(e.g. the Celtic) had strong female figures, most of them had the
male warriors (who were not as bound to the home as women were in
most early societies) as leaders.
     This theory thus puts forward the opinion that men are not
""naturally"" dominant, but that some cultures in which they did
happen to be dominant became successful by crushing other cultures.

Yes.  Perhaps this will give everyone a better understanding of
how primitive conditions interact with male/female biology to
produce the subservience of women:

The Population Factor in Africa's Development Dilemma, Fred T. Sai
...The status of women is a matter of great concern to Africa.
Perhaps the rural African woman is the most underprivileged of
all human beings.  Various social roles, cultural practices and
the biological tasks imposed by fertility have combined to keep
the average rural African woman close to a beast of burden...
...Maternal mortality rates are also very high:  two to six deaths
per 1,000 live births---that is, 100 to 500 times the western
European rates.  Thus the high population growth rates of Africa
result from high fertility and relatively high mortality and are
therefore achieved at a very high price in the lives and health
of African women.  By the time women complete their families, 50%
of their cohort is dead....
...The usual African fertility pattern is for childbearing to
start as soon as it is biologically possible and stop at menopause.
The total fertility rate per woman is between four and eight births,
but mostly between six and eight.  This very high fertility means
the African woman spends between 18 and 20 years of her adult
life in childbearing (that is, the interval between the first live
birth and the last one), in comparison with 3 to 5 years for many
more advanced countries.  
...most women have traditionally handled most of the family
food crop production and have therefore played a major role
in agriculture...
(My favorite line:)
...Her potential for other pursuits is therefore considerably 
reduced....
		-------End of Article------
The suggestion that males are dominant because women fear rape
and beating is probably somewhat of a simplification of the 
situation in primitive cultures, where it was not so much the threat 
of violence from the immediately `dominating' males (mate, brother, 
father, etc), but the threat of violence from a physically hostile
environment, which included males.  The biggest threat probably
came from tribal warefare.  Another threat would be predators. 
In an effort to survive, each tribe naturally depended upon their
most physically strong (ie, males, not only because of raw physical
power, but because they weren't pregnant and nursing babies all of 
the time) members to defend the community against these threats.
This made these folks *very* valuable.  Oh, sure, women had babies
and grew a lot of food, but that's a long-term asset, and humans
are incorrigibly short-term planners.  Under these circumstances,
I believe *I* would have seen males as more `valuable' than myself.
After all, what good is being able to produce babies (most of which
are dead before they reach the age of 2, anyway) and grow food, if
the neighbors are likely to drop in and slaughter us all tomorrow 
night?  My guess is that *women became subservient* (rather than 
men becoming dominant) in order to survive, and also developed 
conniving, manipulative, sexually competitive behaviors in order
to attract and keep males that would protect them and their young.","EEulYse0ycgJ",19,1986-03-05,-1,1

Even though diplomacy begins with a win/win approach, frequently,
the end result has been one side or the other gaining a distinct advantage.
Often, ""Teams"" are built for the purpose of increasing pressure on opposite
side.  This is win/lose.

I agree that this win/win strategy can be developed by men.  In fact,
it should be allowed to developed at a much earlier age than it does.
Those men who use this approach too early to the exclusion of win/lose,
are frequently considered effeminate(sp?).  In elementary school, boys
who aren't willing to fight or play with guns were considered ""sissies""
(Derivation please?:-)).  In Jr. High they were considered ""fairies"".
In high school, they were simply written off as homosexuals (many were,
but not all).  Fortunately by college (perhaps because there was no draft
by the time I got there), it was acceptable to be non-competitive.  Even
then, there were competitions of ""wits"", but it was possible to win without
the ""opponant"" loosing.
In my college (a predominately female school) we were encouraged to
compete against ourselves rather than each other.  The object was to be
better today than you were yesterday.  Of course, the two predominate
programs were music-theater and nursing and 70% of the men at the school
openly admitted that they were homosexual.  Many of the heterosexual men
experienced profound personality changes during there stay in this school.
The sample was very small, less than 60 males in a school of 800 students,
only 18 heterosexual males.
Another interesting observation was that in the fencing course (one of the
few competitive courses), the women were initially more instintively defensive,
ie. able to deflect the thrust, and less counter-offensive (able to deflect
then counter thrust).  Later, the women became more effective at the
counter-offence, so much so that although some never initiated the
offense, they could win in the first deflect/counter.  During the final
""tournament"", there were no male finalists (they had all lost in early
rounds).
This minature model of a ""female dominated"" society was one of the most
educational experiences of my life.  I don't claim to understand women
better because of it, but it did shatter many of my old sexist beliefs.
It also exposed me to several ""feminine"" characteristics which I found
to be quite admirable (and a few that weren't, but we won't get into that:-)).","2cqPj0_KaTsJ",14,1986-03-17,13,1

Note, however, that most of those who work the win/lose game sucessfully
know where to stop.  Those who don't usually don't get very far in an
organization.  Douglas Hofstadter, a few years ago, ran a column in
Scientific American in which he reported on programs that were designed
to play a Co-operate/Defect type of game.  The most successful programs
were those that mimiced their opponents, being just as nice -- or as
nasty -- as the opponents were.

And not necessarily a good role model for humans.  If you supress/ignore

I've got a better idea.  Cut out the TV.  Get him into books now, before
it's too late.  Start with The Wind In The Willows, and the classic Dr.
Suess books.  Make the TV hour a twice-a-week thing, make it a family
affair, and try to avoid the trash.  And recognize that he is just playing.
Play it out with him, and try to get him interested in other things.

I use this sort of thing with men and women -- no sex involved.  Don't
look to the handbooks of seduction.  Look to ``How To Win Friends and
Influence People'' by Dale Carnagie.  Men like Lincoln and Franklin and
both Roosevelts and Andrew Carnagie and ... have done this.  Just don't
say ``could you give me some help?'' as though you WANTED to be patronized.
Say ``could you show me what I'm doing wrong?''.

What the hell kind of place do you work in?  The Dodge City municiple
iron works?  The best way to deal with people like that is to show them
ONCE that you can be a worse SOB than they want to deal with.  Then go
about getting your work done.

  It should be braided or put into pony tails.  It could also be done up in a
multi-colored half shaved fashion like Lauper's head.  Feathers inter-twined
into the pit might be nice also.  Do you prefer blondes or brunetts?  Hot,
muggy, summer days is really the time to evaluate the pit's positive attributes.
This is one of those subjects that requires 'close' examination before making
a snap judgement.  Phewwwww......!  
  But seriously, I don't ever think of armpit hair until the lady in front of
me in a check-out line wearing a halter top scratches her head.  Then I try
NOT to think about it.  Boy, it's a jungle out there. 8-)

Holy Cow. I can't believe some of the discussions that get started in
this group. But as long as you, ah, mentioned it ...
Who SEZ a woman's body should be smooth and clean? Who SEZ a man
should let his armpit hair grow down until he can tie it to his
shoelaces? We're talking cultural and personal preferences here,
folks. Know what's REALLY disgusting when it comes to hair? Those 
guys who have dense clumps of hair growing from their noses and
ears who refuse to trim them ... (yuck, yuck, spit! this is getting
disgusting! :-)
There are certain males who find that armpit hair on a female is a
turn-on. I suspect you find more of them in Europe than in the USA. Is
one preference 'better' than the other? Of course not. No cultural
preference 'should' be the way it is; it just is. An American female 
who chooses to cornrow her leg hair and shave her head bald will, I'll 
wager, find SOME American males who find it a turn-on. And an American
male who chooses to dye his hair flourescent green and put a crowbar
through his nose will find SOME American females who think he's the
bee's knees. Chacun a son gout. There's somebody for everyone, Joe.

  This is a crock. Yes, I'll call you paranoid, but it does not ""serve"" me
to do so. What this really is is sexism and stereotyping, exactly the
same thing I hear you complaining so bitterly against when practiced by men.
Listen to yourself. You are putting all men into a class based on their gender.
If that isn't sexism, I don't know what is. If you want to create a non-sexist
world (a goal I am 100% for, because believe it or not society also has
expectations about what a MAN should or shouldn't do, some of which I find
as objectionable as you apparently do those about women) you could start
by not practicing it yourself.
   I think you are giving a lot of ignorant jerks a lot more credit than they
deserve. This whole notion that all men deliberately subjogate all women
is ridiculous, and propogating it only serves to give the few who really
*are* trying to dominate an ""excuse"" to do so.

First of all, I'm not sure what you mean by ""a certain paradox"". What is
it?  My dictionary defines ""prejudice"" as: a judgment or opinion formed
before the facts are known; preconceived idea, favorable, or more usually,
unfavorable.--Syn. bias. You've said that, based on your acculumation of
experience, you prejudice your opinion of new students based on their sex,
so where's the ""paradox""? Are you trying to imply that, since you feel
it's an accurate preconceived notion, it is a legitimate prejudice, and
the paradox lies in that conclusion?
>I don't feel guilty about that, because I don't think that it interferes
>with my ability to treat each student as an individual anyhow.
You don't *think* it interferes, but how can you be sure?  Do you think
there's a possibility that *your* initial lack of enthusiasm toward your
female students might be projected and, therefore, their level of enthusiasm
towards your class might initially be diminished?  I find it very
difficult to believe that if you set yourself up with the notion,

You *can* make it go away. You tell yourself, ""I will approach each new
student as an *individual* -- period -- from the very beginning and see how
far they want to go."" Saying you can't change it means you never will. As
long as you hold onto that prophecy, it will continue to be self-fulfilled.

Well, your friend may have overreacted somewhat, and refusing to discuss the
issue with you certainly won't help matters, but I can understand her
reaction. How can you say, ""I know it sounds prejudiced, but my experience
has shown me that females are less enthusiastic than males when it comes to
my math courses,"" and not expect her to be upset by that? It *is*
prejudiced, and I can't think of any situation where prejudice can be a
positive thing, so what can you possibly expect to accomplish by hanging on
to it? Even if you feel you *have* come up with some experience-based
insight into the probability of the enthusiasm level of males vs. females,
what does it actually accomplish for you? Especially given that you say you
don't let it influence the approach you take towards them individually.

No, avoiding an issue doesn't make it go away, anymore than ignoring a
toothache will somehow magically heal your tooth. Yes, I can say that I've
sometimes held prejudiced opinions about certain ""types"" of people, and I've
tried very hard to overcome them -- they don't accomplish anything, and they
don't ""prove"" anything. What's the actual ratio of males to females in your
classes? Have you developed this notion on a percentage basis or strictly by
numbers? I.e., last semester you had 21 males and 3 females in your class;
only 1 girl showed any real enthusiasm, but 7 of the males did, therefore
males are generally more enthusiastic than females. People have to be
very careful about letting ideas like that insinuate themselves into our
otherwise sensible minds. The mind can be very subtle when it wants to be
and allow us to *think* we've arrived at some reasonable conclusion because
that's what we really *want* the conclusion to be -- it's called
""rationalizing"", and it can be dangerous. I try to keep a real sharp lookout
for it myself; it can be a tricky little devil.

I've inserted a reference to blacks in addition to your reference to
women to make a point: if you had made your comments about nonwhites,
most people would agree that it reflected a racist reaction to a
situation (note I'm not saying anything yet about your handling of the
racist reaction). Your ""guesser-daemon"" is clearly reacting in a
sexist fashion based upon your experiences with female students. There
are three important questions to be asked here: exactly what is the 
""guesser-daemon,"" what is the extent of your control over what the 
""guesser-daemon"" does, and how do you deal with its assessment of events?
It's convenient sometimes to compartmentalize our mental activities
into ""daemons"" that take responsibility for certain functions. People
who work with computers frequently like to do this (how many times
have you heard a compunerd talk about dumping his/her buffers? :-).
But in reality I think there's little reason to claim an autonomous
process is making the assessment you're talking about. We make sexist
and racist assessments because the constraints of a sexist and racist
society have taught us to do so. An American in a big city who meets a
black person after dark is more likely to be afraid of being mugged 
than an American who meets a white person after dark. An American who
hears the job description ""secretary"" is more likely to think of a
woman than of a man (although as a coworker pointed out, this
certainly wasn't true in the 19th century). No matter what our race,
creed, or sex, we've ALL been guilty of knee-jerk racist and/or sexist
thoughts from time to time. And you don't have to postulate a ""guesser-
daemon"" to understand why.
So the ""guesser-daemon"" doesn't really exist. Given that, can we
eliminate these racist and sexist reactions entirely from our life?
Saying that it's impossible is claiming that in this particular case a
set of reactions can't be unlearned or replaced with another set of
reactions. Is this so? Is it not possible for the addictive person to
learn a new set of behaviors to replace the old? Of course it is: the
fat person who eats because s/he's lonely or has problems can learn to
do away with the loneliness or find other ways of dealing with the
problems. Why should it be impossible for you to make the ""guesser-daemon""
go away if you want to, even if it's based on experience?
As to dealing with the ""guesser-daemon,"" you say that you don't feel
it really affects the way you deal with people. As I've said, we've
all had to deal with our own ""guesser-daemons"" from time to time. The
key thing is RECOGNIZING when we're trying to stereotype people and
being aware of our tendency to do so. You might try, for example, to
go out of your way to make sure you grade papers and assign final
grades fairly without regard to sex since you known this ""daemon"" is
working away somewhere out of reach of your current awareness. 
The only way we'll totally do away with sexism and racism is to change
the way people relate to each other socially and economically. This
has to be handled in part on the state and national levels through
legislation (sorry, all you conservative folks out there, I DON'T
believe in the Benevolent Corporation :-). But the place to begin
change is at home: if each of us recognizes sexist and racist
tendencies in h/erself and nips it in the bud (and disapproves of
racist and sexist comments on the part of family and friends) we'll at
least have taken a small step toward the just and fair society implied
by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

Greg, the point being made is that there ARE men out there who do that
kind of sh*t.  She didn't say that ALL men were like that; not all men
are.  Unfortunately, there are those who aren't like you.  I once worked
as a consultant for a small, all-male (except for me) consulting firm as a
programmer.  While we were on one site, the boss and his assistant were
insisting it was MY job to make coffee even though I was the only one not
drinking it!

Phrases like ``legitimite prejudice'' kind of dull the meaning of both
words, don't they?  The question is one of reality.  And he is dead-on-the
money -- boys do better than girls at math, men do better than women
at math -- on a statistical basis.  You can find women who do very
well at math, but, statistically speaking, this is rare.  this is a
big topic of discussion for proghfessional educators -- I've waded
through mounds and mounds of discussion on the subject.  Is the reason
for this due to differences between the male and female brain?  is it
due to the fact that mathematical ability is encouraged by playing with
blocks and legos and girls don't get enough of these as children? Is
it that girls mature and get interested in boys earlier than boys do and
then stop competing with boys in the classroom because it is perceived to be
unfeminine?  Because math classes are boring in general, but boys are more
programmed to stick it out than girls are through their conditioning?
I have read study after study, and I have no idea whether there is any
truth in any of them.  But to dismiss it as a prejudice is to ignore that
it is going on, as if it is the fault of the math teachers (most of
whom are overjoyed to get an enthusiastic student, of whatever sex.)

Holy smokes, by the time you get to university you had better be immune to
``I care more about what the teacher thinks about me than about the 
subject itself'' disease.  Especially in mathematics classes.  Remember,
what he is looking for is people who are so enthusiastic about their
subject that they don't care if the teacher is a walrus.   it is this
type of student which he finds is almost never female -- and this type
of student doesn't care what the teacher's opinion of them is, if they
ever notice it.

It is an accurate representation of reality -- what is.  It is better to
walk around with concepts which mirror the world that is rather than
the world you would like to live in.  Is he expected to choose the things
he believes in on the basis of what it accomplishes for you -- or on the
basis of what is true?

  I agree that there are men out there that are like this. All stereotypes
persist because there are at least some who fit them. But the statement
""threaten male dominance IN GENERAL"" (emphasis mine) seems to indicate
the way the original author thiks, i.e. very sexist.

Hmmm, well I'm not sure I'd agree it's racist.  Nor am I sure that his
reaction to his students is sexist.  I think it's the matter of degree
that troubles me.  I know folks from outside of Detroit who've *never*
seriously spoken to a black who think that Harold Washington has no
business whatsoever being mayor of Chicago because he's black.  (Do
they care that the city of Chicago is 70% black?  Nope.)  *That's* what
I call racist.  My uncle has *never* listened with respect to a woman
in his life, and he thinks as long woman insist on wearing pants and
non-frilly blouses that he's perfectly justified in referring to
chairMEN.  Women in pants are clearly forfeiting their womanhood, after
all.  *That's* what I call sexist.
The fellow you quote clearly doesn't fall into this category.  He seems
to have shown respect for his female students, and states that he is in
fact quite pleased when he finds an enthusiastically mathematical
female.  His ""problem"" is that his past experience is influencing his
expectations in current situations.  Recognizing trends in one's
experience is recognizing trends in one's experience.  It does become
prejudice, however, when that which is in the past influences one's
expectations in new situations, i.e. when one ""pre-judges"" someone
else.  Is that an ideal reaction?  Nope.  Is it a reasonable one?
Well, I don't know.  It's certainly been my past experience that it
happens, and based on that I expect it to continue. [B-)]
So it's prejudicial.  But is it sexist?  You state:
>An American who
>hears the job description ""secretary"" is more likely to think of a
>woman than of a man (although as a coworker pointed out, this

It's true that before now I've always considered the assumption that a
secretary is female to be sexist.  But is it really sexist, or is it
""merely"" prejudicial?  I think of ""sexist"" as that which denigrates or
oppresses a person (esp. a woman) based on gender.  Is assuming that a
secretary is female (while being equally responsive and open to male
secretaries) denigrating or oppressive?  After all, a secretary is a
responsible and quite necessary position.  Is the expectation that a
female will probably be less enthusiastic about math (while not doing
*anything* to ensure that it's true) denigrating or oppressive?
They're both clearly prejudicial (in that an assessment is being made
before all the current facts are available), but are they sexist?
And (as you're all wondering by now) is it an important distinction?
Beats me.  [Sometimes I think I just post 'cause my fingers like to
type.  B-)]  But anyway, I recall the Danieal (original poster) asking
for input to this ""past experience"" thing so here's mine:  I don't think
your ""guesser-daemon"" is particularly unique to you (I *do* think it's
refreshingly unique that you're concerned about it), nor do I think it's
sexist.  But I do think it's prejudicial.  What to do about it?
Recognize that you're ""pre-judging"" the females (and perhaps the males)
in your classes, that you're making judgements about them before you
know them personally.  And then make a conscious effort to be open to
what's really there, instead of what you expect to be there.  If you're
already doing that (it sounds like you might be), well then I think
that's best you can do.  I wish I could think of a specific way to make
the feelings disappear altogether (gosh, do I wish I find that answer!),
but I can't, so I think dealing with them head on is the best we've got.
Now back to the article at hand:

Well, it's possible for an addictive personality to learn a new set of
behaviors, and they can change their attitudes towards their *addic-
tion*, but I'm not sure it's possible for them to cure their addiction.
After all, alcoholics and other substance abusers can never have another
drink/hit again or they go back off the deep end.  Of course, people with
eating disorders clearly don't stop eating forever.  I don't know about
turning off ""guesser-daemons"" tho.  I mean, expecting that which has
happened repeatedly before to happen again is pretty thoroughly ingrained
in us.  Learning language and cultural idiosyncracies couldn't happen
without the trait.  All of science is based on it.  I'd be real surprised
if anybody could truly turn it off in just a few of these particular
situations.

This I agree with.  (In fact, I seem to have simply reworded it above.
But it took me so long to write it that I'm not gonna delete it now.

Since when is pointing out an observed fact (that blacks are more likely
to be crime victims from other blacks than from whites) racist?  Don't
bother answering, it has the same answer as ""since when is pointing out
an observed fact sexist?"".  (Answer: when you don't like the fact.)

	You've hit the nail right on the head.  If you actually manage to
provoke open warfare between the sexes (unlikely, but if...) women will
lose.  A sexist statement?  Possibly, but I am thinking more along the
lines of 'God is on the side with the most ammunition'.  If you back a rat
into a corner it will fight against great odds.  But what if the rat attempts
to back a cat into a corner?  Will the fact that the cat is larger and stronger
than the rat really prevent it from taking action in its own defense?  If there
is a 'power balance' between the sexes it currently lies rather heavily in
favor of men.
	The greatest thing that the 'feminist stance' (I quote that because I
don't want to get involved in trying to define/defend/attack the term) is that
it is RIGHT.  Sexism is a non-rational attack against PEOPLE based upon certain
physical characteristics.  Racism is the same.  So is bigotry against any
ethnic group you care to name.  As long as the 'war' is fought on these
grounds you will receive a lot of moral support (and other kinds) from
people who are not otherwise involved.  This is akin to Gandi's liberation
of India.  And its ultimate success will rest on the same principles that his
did -- people are basically GOOD.  There will always be jerks and assholes
out there,  but these are made all the more noticable because of the way
they stand out from the milieu.  If this were not true, then Gandi's plan
would not have worked.  If the British response had simply been to kill 10
people for every infraction, non-violence would have gotten him nowhere.
The Indians would probably have won the ensuing war, but at what cost?  Pyrrhic
victories belong in textbooks, not in real life.
	So what is the answer?  I think education is the only effective means.
Make people aware of the sexism that exists, and why and how it deny's women
the right to be PEOPLE and to be treated as such.

	I am glad to hear you are willing to hold your own views.  I would
never attack you for 'not saying what all the other feminists are saying' --
whatEVER that might be.  I am just saddened to hear that you are willing
to throw your strongest weapon out the door just to feed your ego.  Name

>Hmmm, well I'm not sure I'd agree it's racist.  Nor am I sure that his
>reaction to his students is sexist.  
First of all, a disclaimer: I didn't intend to pick on the original
poster as a sexist, racist, or anything else. I think we're ALL
members of a society where sexism and racism are so commonplace that
it's difficult for any of us to claim complete purity of thought. Let
him who is without guilt ...
I'm not sure either about the racism of the attitude I described, but 
let's think about it some more since the 'sexist' or 'racist' accusation 
seems to be made in this group from time to time. Observing a situation 
in your environment in which two groups perform differently on the 
average and making statements about the statistical likelihood of a 
group's member acting in a certain way may not be a sexist/racist act 
in and of itself. But we have to talk about this act of observation in 
context: that is, what assumptions and attitudes bring a person to 
automatically make the observation on meeting a person of a certain 
group? And we can also talk about the results of making the observation: 
does it or doesn't it affect the person's future interactions with the 
members of the group and h/er attitudes and assumptions about members of 
the group?
What are sexism and racism, anyway? It seems to me they involve the
assumption that a person has a certain set of capabilities based on
h/er membership in a group. The distinction between making a blanket
assumption about ALL members in a group and a qualified assumption
about a person's statistical likelihood of possessing certain 
capabilities is not at all clear to me. Sexism/racism involve an
assessment of observed behavior (I'm here developing my own thoughts on
what sexism/racism involve, not quoting some authority; feel free to
argue against this, but don't ask for sources 'cause there ain't none
:-), an implied reason for the behavior being different for the two 
(or more) groups, and an action taken based on the observation of
behavior.
The original poster's ""daemon"" certainly was making an assessment of
observed behavior. For him to measure the sexism (if any) present 
in his assessment, he has to ask himself a couple of questions:
   1. Is the assessment important to his functioning as a teacher
      in some way? If so, how, and if not, why did he feel it was 
      important to make this assessment? 
   2. Did he feel his observation was colored in any way by
      assumptions that may be inherently sexist?
The thing is, the poster didn't give a reason for the behavior being
different (""well, we all KNOW what women are like...""), or suggest
that any action be taken based on the behavior he observed. So I don't
think his observation was sexist at all. It's the kind of observation
that could be USED by sexists to reinforce their model for female
behavior, however; and that's where the real danger lies, I think.

Well, it's certainly obvious racism. But I think racism can take much
subtler and insidious forms; consider the Jensen and Shockley
'hypotheses' about the inferior performance of blacks on I.Q. tests.

The only person I hope to change in my life is MYSELF. If I can
recognize my own prejudice and change my own attitudes, I'll be a
better person for it. But if I hear other people spouting what I
perceive to be sexism or racism, you'd better believe I'll let them
know I don't want that kind of crap spouted in my presence (no, I'm
not referring at all to the original poster).

The problem is, I think, that the assumption does lead to oppression
in that a potential employer will tend to pigeonhole inexperienced
people for certain positions based on prejudice. And once you're
pegged as a secretary it may be difficult to move up to a real
challenging position like 'Girl Friday' (hey, that's a joke, folks!).
>And (as you're all wondering by now) is it an important distinction?

Well, I do think it's important, because I think it's the uncritical
acceptance of these assumptions by people in power that LEADS to
things like oppression.

Ah, but as I've pointed out, one's attitudes toward one's own
""daemons"" can be changed. And that's the path to reducing one's own
sexist/racist tendencies, I think. At least for me.

You choose the male, of course: ""The contest goes not always to the
strong, nor the race to the swift -- but that's the way to bet.""
If you don't know anything about the individual, you're reduce to
either making guesses on the basis of percentages, the basis of
prejudice, or refusing to guess.  In the example above, if you don't
bet, you can't win.  If you guess on the basis of percentages
(""scientific prejudice,"" if you will), you have the highest chance of
being right.  If you guess on the basis of prejudice (for example,
""I'm a feminist, so I'll choose the woman""), the odds are (in
general) less favorable.
In any event, though, ""sexism"" is too harsh a term to use in this
example.  Sexism is when you stick to your prejudices IN SPITE OF
evidence, not when you make stereotypical guesses when you can't get
any hard information.

Good answer. Ithink that was the point of the person who originally
posted the article about his ""guesser daemon"". He had no knowledge
of the people who came into his class, and he had to make decisions
based upon the odds. Unfortunately, what this does is perpetuate the
status quo - in this case the male dominance of the field of mathematics.
This is the point of affirmative action programs - to be sexist or
racist in the opposite direction in the hopes of evening out the
unfairnesses. I support the concept of affirmative action, but the point
I wanted to make was that when it comes right down to it, sometimes a
betting person has to play the odds and deal with the world as it is,
rather than as it should be. And when it happens, it isn't necessarily
sexist.

Jeez, Cheryl, I've been in graduate school in two disciplines
(environmental sciences and computer science) and I've NEVER heard a
male grad student say anything like that of a female student. And a
grad student who did make a comment like that would have been shouted
down by his fellow students, male and female alike. Maybe these people
were deliberately pulling your chain ... or maybe the graduate
students I've been around are a little more mature than the group you

Ahem. Well. This is nothing less than academic snobbery, Cheryl. Perhaps
you mean she had an undergraduate degree that demanded more rigorous
mathematics than her male peers'. I've certainly known physics majors 
that were uncreative dim bulbs in my time (read: mathematical rigor

Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. Is this an 'in' thing, perhaps from
net.women? You should remember this is going out to net.singles as
well before you start referencing people we haven't heard of.
 
>	...Have you read Joanne Simpson's article?
Again, I assume you're referring to something mentioned in net.women,
a newsgroup I don't subscribe to. If people are going to cross-post to
other newsgroups in the middle of an exchange they should keep this in
mind.
As to Joanne Simpson, I took a graduate seminar in weather
modification from her while I was a grad student at the University of
Virginia. She told a story about her advisor when she was working on a
PhD who asked her what she was insterested in. She said ""cloud
physics,"" and he told her that was a good field for a girl to go into
because it wasn't very important and she wouldn't have much
competition from men. This fellow was a famous meteorologist, Rossby I
think. 
Joanne was known for going to bat for her graduate students, male as
well as female. She went out of her way to make sure her people were
progressing in their careers, and helped many female graduate students
survive in a male-dominated field. Politically, however, she and her
husband Robert are less than fully enlightened. They've received
massive grants over the years from the Phillipine and South African
governments for weather modification studies, and I once heard Robert
Simpson make the following comment in a seminar:
         ""...Some say Ferdinand Marcos is a dictator.
          Well, I say if he's a dictator the world
          needs more dictators like him...""
Although Joanne is compassionate and caring where feminist issues are
concerned, she seems sometimes to adjust her politics for maximum
personal benefit.

Nope. NOBODY'S allowed to be sexist, because ANY sexism is wrong. To
believe otherwise is to be a hypocrite, Cheryl. It's as though Desmond
Tutu were preaching that blacks should exploit whites in South Africa
for 200 years (or whatever) to 'make up' somehow for white domination.
Suppression is WRONG no matter who's doing it.

We were discusisng this in net.politics.theory a while ago.  I still think
that sexism and racism involve the assumption that a person is *inferior*
based on he/r membership in a group.   Not everybody who reads politics
theory agrees with me.
Men have penises thus is not sexist.  Blacks have black hair is not racist.
(They have the same flaws as all generalisations --  castrated men are
still men,  and Blacks who bleach ther hair are still Blacks.)  I don't
think ``most mathematicians are men'' is sexist either -- it is reality.
``Most mathematicians are men because almost no women can think logically''
*is* sexist.
I get very worried about political movements which can't tell the difference
between a statement of fact and a slur.  Are their perceptions so warped
by their ideology that they cannot perceive what is?

Well, no, I don't think it would be sexist, but it might not be very bright.
When I was majoring in math at the University of Colorado, about two thirds
of us students, undergraduates and graduates, were women.  The professors
were mostly men, though.
The sciences that seemed to me to be overwhelmingly filled with men were
physics, chemistry, engineering of various sorts (my sister was the only
woman majoring in Mechanical Engineering in her class), and geology.  Women
seemed very numerous in biology, the ""social sciences"", and math.
So maybe the stereotype is mistaken?  (They are occasionally, I've noticed.)
Or was CU really abnormal in this respect?

Not exactly a flame, and I'll try to be interesting.  Your reference
to Ghandi in this context is rather strange since, if you will
remember (or care to read any history books on the subject), Ghandi's
'liberation of India' let to one of the bloodiest civil wars in
history.  The Muslims and Hindus each tried to exterminate the other
in order to be the 'ruling party' when the British left.  
  	The British knew this would happen.  They tried to tell the
world that it would happen, but nobody was interested in listening.
Ghandi had the world brainwashed.
	This doesn't mean that I believe in 'the war of the sexes',
just that I don't believe in 'peaceful' civil disobedience.

Since (in my experience) all the secretaries I have met happened to be
women, I think it is hardly sexist to think that the next secretary
I come across will PROBABLY be a woman. If, in fact, the percentage
of women secretaries vs men secretaries in past experience is
roughly 100%, it is a reasonable assumption to make that the next
secretary will be a woman.

I think I understand what Greg I saying, as I have been known to
express the same sentiments before.  However, after dealing with
AA and EO matters for a few years, I have come to agree that past
inequities, malicious or innocent in cause, must be rectified before
minorities and women can truly have the SAME chance.  To not have
appropriate representation of these groups thoughout our society
can reduce the chances an individual might have by conveying the
impression that such representation is not possible.  In not seeing
any of ""one's own kind"" represented in high-status or leadership
positions, a feeling of lower self-value is generally instilled in
people; and how one feels about oneself goes a long way in determining
how sucessful one can be.
This isn't a ""flame"", just something more to think about.

I think it's probably a matter of viewpoint. If a group thinks all
other groups' capabilities represent the normal range but that IT 
happens to be wildly *superior* to all other groups, does that qualify 
as racism/sexism/etc.? But then again, I guess this is claiming that

is too weak to be really useful...

Laura, this seems to carry the implicit belief that *if* most women could
*not* think logically, they would be `inferior'.  This can be extrapolated
to ""if most women cannot think *as* logically as most men, then women,
on the whole, are indeed inferior to men, on the whole"" and also to
""if individual X cannot think as logically as individual Y, then
individual X is inferior to individual Y"".
I'm not sure if this is what *you* meant, but it hits on what *I* see
as the real basis for racism, sexism, Ugly Americanism, prejudice, etc
(instead of stereotypes, which I see as a distraction from the real
issue), so I'm going to comment from there.  Don't take it personally!
I think the real problem is that various cultures and subcultures
define certain human characteristics as being more `valuable' than
others.  In our society, things that appear to enhance success in
business or achievement of power, for example, seem to head the list.
These values are so ingrained that it becomes impossible for the
person holding them to accept someone else as `equal' unless they
have these characteristics to more or less the same degree as
the particular group that values them:  Blacks can't really be
equal to whites unless they are as `intelligent' and women can't
really be equal to men unless they can think as `logically'.
Then you get off into silly and unfruitful efforts to try to compare
groups based on characteristics that we can't even evaluate.
I could go on for many screenfulls on this subject, but, lucky netters,
I won't!  I'll just say that I think the real problem is how we assess 
the `value' of human beings, *not* stereotyping (which is often quite
justified and accurate).","TDS15rAw3-EJ",0,1986-03-01,-7,1

I'd modify Laura's definition to say that statements which involve any
difference in quality (positive or negative) are sexist or racist.
For example, ""Men make better mathematicians because they are logical
thinkers"" counts as sexist in my book.  I'm not sure Laura's definition
would classify it as sexist.

I wouldn't call their perceptions ""warped"" so much as ""blurred"".  Often
when you are close to a problem, statements get emotionally charged (even
if they are not intended to be).  This makes picking out facts from slurs
difficult.  Adding to this problem is the fact that most facts can be used
to ""prove"" slurs. (""More mathematicians are men because men think more
logically than women"" - where exactly does the fact end?)  Unfortunately,
I don't have a foolproof system for communicating facts so that they cannot
be misinterpreted - if anybody does, please let me know.  (Better yet,
post it to the net - it would solve a LOT of problems!)  So it looks like
we'll just have to muddle along with our faulty perceptions for the fore-
seeable future.

I don't know if CU is ""abnormal,"" but my experience has been that the stereo-
type is at least a reasonable approximation to reality.  While I was
an undergraduate (Augustana College, Rock Island, IL) there weren't many
women in math / computer science; maybe 25-33% of enrollment.  (Side note:
many of those women were planning on going into teaching in math; most of
the men were looking for jobs as programmers or actuaries.)  Physics was
also heavily male.  I don't know about biology or chemistry.  There were more
women in social sciences (except economics) and languages.  Business was
pretty evenly divided (maybe fewer women in accounting, since the department
head was very sexist).  And Purdue's CS department only has 3 women PhD
students.

There's only one problem with this -- there are no really more effective
ways  of balancing things out *at this time*. The biggest problem
women have been facing has been getting past the stereotypes of certian
types of jobs are suitable for men and others for women. This is still
very much a problem -- even more so the last 5 years. I have been
reading of a couple of studies (I've not been able to get ahold
of the references - if anyone can find them please let me know) that
have come out in the last month and a half that have been pointing
out this is the problem women are still running into (I think
Science a couple of weeks back). Employers and personnel types have a
very stereotypical idea of what jobs women can(and should) handle.
The problem is that they still are hiring accordingly. One of the
results of the studies was that AFFIRMATIVE ACTION actually helped
tremendously to cut down this disparaty in hiring in certian job
catagories that are quite typically heavily male oriented. The reason
is that the threat of fines imposable on companies served to act
as a moderator of this stereotypic thinking in the hiring practices.
No other programs had as much effect. 
The problem over the last 5 years is that the current administration
has been undermining all such programs. The strides that were made
are being eroded badly. 
So, until someone comes up with any thing better, I would
rather keep it around a while -- maybe until a few of the stereotypes
are forgotten. (Beleive me it can be done. In my immediate family,
all of the females (4) are in non-typical fields (1 areonautical
engineer;1 areospace engineer; 1 geologist/computer researcher in AI;
1 National Forest Fire Management officer (she sets slash burns and
commands a crew putting out forest fires around here). And we've
all had our problems with companies.)

what it's like.:-)

My SO (gag, I hate that word!) works in an environment largely dominated
by men, and experiences a significant amount of sexist attitudes and remarks
directed at her by men she works with. She smiles, laughs it off and does her 
job. She's been quite successful. Other women I know react to these situations
by becoming defensive and alienating the men they work with. Of course, men
continue to disparage these women. These women are never accepted, and their 
success is limited.
In business as in academics, politics is part of the game, whether we like
it or not. If you don't play, you lose.

This is all rather humorous because the woman under question is none other
than Marina Ratner, who WAS hired by the Berkeley Math Department.  She has
a heavy but clearly understandable and even pleasant accent.
The flap was something as follows: the department has room for two more
tenured faculty, say.  Six candidates are under consideration.  One's a
topologist, and all the topologists want to hire him.  One's an algebraic
geometer, and all the algebraic geometers want to hire him.  One's an
ergodic theorist, and all the ergodic theorists want to hire her.  And so
on.  Exactly one of the six is a woman.  None of them are superstars, but
all of them are better than adequate mathematicians.  It is impossible to
call any of them better or worse than any of the others.  For one thing,
the topologists don't know any algebraic geometry, etc.  Guess what happens?
Bargaining, politics, name calling, etc.  And someone is bound to throw in
the affirmative action angle.  And then someone hits back with the we hire
them because they're good, not because we have a quota, etc.  And then
someone says ""but she is good"", to which the reply is, ""but we need another
dynamical systems person"", etc.  It's ugly and I know of no other method.
But none of the debate is supposed to leak out.  Apparently that happened
with MR.  Perhaps some of those who wanted to hire her wanted to embarrass
their opponents?  I don't know.
I would guess her age was more of an issue than her sex.  Mathematicians are
stereotypically considered burnt out by 40, and the usual preference is to
hire straight out of grad school/post doc, not some other universities' old-
timers, even if they were trapped all these years behind the Iron Curtain.
It is certainly false that language barriers had anything to do with her
hiring question.  Only recently has there been a crackdown on graduate
student TAs who can't speak English.  But faculty?  No way.
A somewhat different problem came up with the hiring of the late Julia
Robinson.  Her husband was already on the faculty, and the state of Calif-
ornia has laws concerning nepotism, and Berkeley is a state University.  It
was a major legal/bureaucratic hassle to get her even a part-time position.
Considering her reknown--she was a McArthur fellow and recently president of
the AMS--her position was mostly an embarrassment to Berkeley.  She herself
did not mind--she rarely had to teach!--and everyone, certainly herself,
knew her value as a mathematician.
(This nepotism problem is an extreme nuisance to grad student TAs whose
fathers are already on the faculty.  Their TA position takes a little bit
longer to clear than normal, and quite often their checks are late etc.
And if they withdraw a year and come back, they get hassled afresh.)

I am a relatively new person to the net, but I have been reading
the discussions about harrassment with some interest, amusement, and
concern. Maybe I can't add anything significant, but... here goes.
I think that many people (I like the word ""people"" as opposed to
""men,"" ""women,"" etc.) have had similar experiences to Mark's ""You
should have tried harder"" encounter; I know that I have. However,
before either sex uses this as an excuse for: 1) justification for
being ""confused"" as to just what people want, or 2) pointing an
accusing finger and crying out ""foul! That is just what the problem
is!,"" there are a couple of issues that- as Rod Serling would say-
I submit for your approval.
Firstly, harrassment is defined on two levels: the individual and
the state (i.e. law). The latter is clearly defined, the former is not.
Part of the problem is, then, the dissonance between my definition
of harrassment any someone else's. OF COURSE, we all KNOW that, but
it takes COMMUNICATION for anyone ELSE to KNOW that too. I have found
that the most reliable form of communication verbal- NOT
(and I shudder as I type this) body language. In Mark's case,
she said what she said because of possibly many factors. For example,
being put on the spot, a standard ""line"" for dealing with such questions,
or because she actually meant it. Politeness dictates that one should
respect another person's  answer and leave it at that. Hats off to you,
Mark- you did the right thing (in my view, that is). Now, I do not think
that Mark had crossed that all-important and dangerous line between
aggression and harrassment, but that was for HER to decide, not me
or even Mark. However, her dumping of the drink (by the way, what was
it? Maybe it just didn't taste very good...)  in Mark's lap is, in
my opinion, a CLEAR example of harrassment, albeit relatively harmless.
I am sure that Mark has the personal integrety to laugh off such an 
incident without condemming all of women/single/pub/being-friendly/
I'll-never-do-that-again-ever/- hood. Enough! Enough!
Secondly, we as persons MUST address the issues that: 1) Yes, there
are people out there who think of the opposite sex as sexual objects,
2) Yes, there are people who are militant in stamping out the often
violent and demeaning effects of #1, 3) No, not all people are like
#1 (I personally think that ""all"" should be ""most""), and, finally,
4) Things *are* changing, for the better. If we can rid our society
of this long-standing trait (some would say ""tradition,"" ""preference,""
""alternate lifestyle,"" ad nauseum), we can move on to bigger and better
things. I am personally looking forward to this. This is a prejudice
that is one of societies' most WASTEFUL. I believe that awareness of
the general mood coupled with RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BASED ON CLEAR,
HONEST, HUMAN COMMUNICATION is our best bet. Right now do you, my
ever patient readers, think I am a man or a woman or can't tell? WHY?
In conclusion, I can sympathize with the experience Mark had.
Clearly, he was the beneficiary of the incident. Not only did he
avoid meating (OOOH! Freudian slip!) someone who may have been a 
real drag, but he got a free drink too! Not a lesson to be under-
rated! Plough on, Mark!

The logic behind these rules is that if she's interested, she'll call you

1) if she says no three times, never ask again.
2) if she has a reasonable excuse (homework, previous commitment, pluck
eyebrows), that still counts as a no. 
3) if she stands me up even once, never ask again. 
4) if she stands me up without a very good execuse, write her off
completely -- even if she calls back.  There's no excuse for
treating someone like that.
(the following rules may sound like jokes, but they've all happened to 
me at one time or another)
5) if she brings another boyfriend along on a date, don't go out with
here again.
6) if she invites you to spend the weekend, and another boyfriend is
there for the same weekend, terminate the relationship.
7) if she invites you to live with her, find out if she's already
living with someone else first.

        Indeed, it can be difficult, there are no `formulas'. I do think
        you should have had a pretty easy time figureing this one out:

        Seems pretty obvious to me.  If someone says ""no"", but continues
        to flirt, try again (unless you don't like people who play `hard
        to get').  (if s/he says ""no"" again, give up!)

        Avoid dry-cleaning bills by wearing washable clothes 8^).  I'd
        guess you erred by treating a ""traditional"" woman as if she were a
        ""non-traditional"" one, and she was insulted.  The dating game
        has very complicated rules, which is one of the reasons so many
        people (me, for instance) want to forget it and just be people.  I
        think it's ironic that, in theory, once you're good enough at the
        game to ""win"", you're supposed to stop playing 8^) )

        Same here (on both counts).  It's really too bad everybody doesn't

Well, I have noticed one thing about all of the responses
to ""what do I do when she walks over and pours her drink
down my pants"".  Either they are ineffective or they
are illegal.
Bear in mind that if someone is soooo warped as to assault
you (that's what it is, kiddies) because you weren't
persistant, they are probably warped enough to get you
arrested for sexual harrassment if you pour back.
I think the course is prefectly clear.  Say ""Goodbye"",
notice where she is sitting, and go call the police.
When they arrive (I'm assuming that the twit isn't
leaving, because you've given her the impression that
you are wimp enough to not do anything) have your friends and yourself
tell the cop what happened, and swear out a complaint for assault.
It may be long and involved, but at least it's legal,
and it may leave the desired impression.
Having a drink tossed in your lap for not being persistant enough
is indeed a criminal act.  It is also manipulative,
amoral, and lots of other things, so if you think you're
wrong to complain in a legal way, you might consider WHY
you think that.
I don't advocate calling the law in every concievable case,
or anything like that, however, when things are unclear,
and you are in an exposed position, it pays to cover your
buns.  If you really want to be sure of the legal facts,
call a lawyer!

YES! One of the things that frustrates me most about growing older
is that I find it is virtually impossible to make friends with
married women. The assumption is that if a married woman hangs
around with a single guy she is either cheating on her spouse or
thinking about cheating on her spouse. I blame this equally on
jealous husbands who are so insecure that they can't stand the
thought that their wife might want to spend time with someone else
occasionally, and on women who cave into to this kind of pressure
rather than being independent enough to decide for themselves who
their friends are going to be.

I agree, but due to frequent experience in seedy Southern bars with

mean, and ugly; and whatever else they are incompetent at, they ain't
incompetent at beating people up!

Okay, I give up. What's the difference? Seems like a binary kind of
thing to me. You are, or you aren't. (I might also add, ""Who cares?"")
As for the content of net.singles, and who should post/not post,
this sounds like the travesty that just took place over on
net.women. Some individuals were claiming that other individuals, by
reason of their sex, gender, male/femaleness, testosterone level,
etc., should be allowed to post/not post to net.women.
What gives????  The net is much like life; sometimes it is
good/interesting/stimulating/etc., and sometimes it ain't. Trying to
control the content or who posts may only discourage the good
discussions that float along every so often.
There does seem to be a dichotomy among posters, though, as evidenced
by the recent discussion on normal/abnormal ""aloneness."" Some
netters seem to wear their singleness like a badge (I'm single and
alone, and proud of it!), while others have had their singleness
thrust upon them, and bear it quietly/painfully/joyfully on the way
to somewhere else.
Is the real issue here that the first group sees the second group as
not as qualified to be proclaiming singleness? Are we going to have to
take a test before we are allowed to post?
Her: Why, Andy, what's wrong? You look very upset!
Andy:  I need a hug. (sniff, sniff, tear rolling down a cheek). I'm
       so ashamed. I failed my singleness test. I'm only ""nominally""
       single....

	Single:  unmarried (currently unmarried, I suppose, as the term
divorcee is now archaic)
	nominally Single:  unmarried but enjoying a close relationship with
an SO (possibly living together but with at least two abodes)

   What I think he means is that there are people like me who are not married
(i.e. single on tax forms), but who are definitely not ""available.""  There
have also been a few contributors who *are* married, or living in what amounts
to married relationships.

   If I had had no previous contact with the original poster, I would have
thought it was the sour-grapes complaining of a lonely person who resents
the fact that those in stable relationships are flaunting said
relationships.  This doesn't, to me, seem like something that would come
from the person in question.  Perhaps he would care to elucidate?
   I view net.singles as neither a personals column nor a place where those
currently ""alone"" can commiserate, but as a forum to discuss relationships
between adults of the opposite sex (cf. net.motss), and related activities
(just to keep it general ;-).  I would hate to think that one's thoughts are
neither appreciated nor wanted just because of ""nominal singleness.""  The 
parallel to net.women is a good one, especially considering that there is
(was?) a net.women.only in existence for those who want discussion limited to
only women.  (As an aside, I monitored net.women.only for 3 or 4 months, and
there was only *one* posting to it.  Draw your own conclusions.)
   Any other opinions?

   This is not only a ""travesty"" that just took place, it is a CONTINUING
thing. The problem is that people are focusing on an ideal net instead of
the real thing. The real issue is not whether some people should or shouldn't
post to a given group; the FACT is that you CAN'T KEEP THEM OUT. So, it's
pointless to argue whether men should post to net.women, or married persons
should post to net.singles; we couldn't stop them even if we wanted to.
I fail to see why people in net.women complain; because the reality of the net
caused the group (and the subsequent net.women.only) to fail in its *original*
purpose (which was a non-hostile forum to discuss feminist issues), the 
feminist mailing list was created. This list has been HIGHLY successful in
providing such a forum. Those people who really want to keep out ""hostile""
points of view should consider joining or starting a mailing list or creating
a moderated newsgroup.

Thanks for a detailed and (I think) mostly accurate description of
both groups. Describes my current situation and attitudes fairly 
closely. Boy, now that you lay it out in black & white I can see what 
a real SICKO I am! Quick, where's the nearest singles bar?   ;-)

I'm in the second group. I'll be 39 in January and have lived alone
for about five years now. You should know that we're far MORE
intolerant and self-indulgent than you could ever imagine; why, I just
HATE people who accuse me of being intolerant and self-indulgent!
That's why I never, never talk to other people or let them into my
life! And as for self-indulgence, why, I'll show you self-indulgence,
buddih: I'm going to go out and buy a lobster dinner and eat it ALL BY
MYSELF and not even invite anyone to share it with me! So THERE!
(Oh, and by the way, :-)
No one is ready for a sustained and giving relationship with another
person until he is happy with his own life and likes and respects
himself as a person. Many people spend their youth frantically
searching for a One True Love; a few find a relationship that lasts
for a substantial period of time; many live dissatisfied after the
initial sexual glow wears off; many more flit from relationship to
relationship searching for a One True Love that is a grand lie foisted
on us by a thousand-year-old European romantic tradition and mass
media that are as obsessed with selling True Love as with selling Sex
(The long sad history of the True Love myth will have to await another
posting). The relationships that last are the result of plain old hard 
work and dedication, folks, with a small element of luck thrown in. 
There's nothing magical about sex OR love. 
There's also nothing about living by myself that changes me magically
into a different person if I don't 'share my life' with someone else
by having them in constant proximity to my person. Like, wow, you've
been living by yourself for five years now; you'd better find a
housemate or SO soon, or you'll become too INTOLERANT and SELF-INDULGENT 
to ever do it again! A-and all those close friendships with other 
people don't count: you've got to have them under your roof to stave 
off these twin menaces!
Someone very close to me is on his third marriage. It's precisely his 
intolerance and self-indulgence that doomed his first two marriages,
and I'm terribly afraid it's going to happen again. He was married the
first time at 18, and has been unattached for only a few months
between marriages. So don't give me any crap about how having an SO
makes one tolerant and generous. Life doesn't fit into pigeonholes,
my friends.

Or in other words, you're not ready to live with anyone
else until you've lived alone enough.  
Wait a minute. . .that doesn't sound right.  How do you
learn to live with someone except by doing it?  Once you
learn not to need anyone else, how do you learn to let them in
again?  It seems to me that there's more required than just being
able to get along with yourself--I know LOTS of people who
can do that just fine; it's learning to give and take that they
fail at.  And THAT can only be learned with practice.

I'm sorry if you are as disillusioned as you appear,
Bill, because I can still find some magic out there
in places.  It's not something that you can depend on;
it's fleeting, like a butterfly.  But you can still

Nope. You're misinterpreting what I'm saying. Many people feel they
can't live by themselves because they're insecure or immature. Or
because they feel that life without an SO is less than satisfying.
These people approach potential relationships with a lot of fantasies
built up in their heads that a new relationship will somehow make
their life better. A relationship based on fantasy will sooner or
later come to a bad end. My claim is that a person who is happy with
his own life is secure and mature, and will approach relationships
with realistic expectations.

Cynicism? I don't think so. What seems like cynicism to you seems like
realism from my side of the fence.
Note that 'disillusioned' literally means free from illusion or false 
ideas. It's precisely our American illusions about the nature of love
that I believe have led to the brief lifespan of so many relationships
in our society. I wasn't denying that falling in love can be an
overwhelming experience, and one of the most delightful sensations in
life. But True Love has become a fetish in our society, and the
'magic' I was criticising is the false magic of the fetish. Hasn't anyone
ever said to you when you've come off a failed relationship that it
wasn't really TRUE Love, and that you'd KNOW True Love when it came
along?
The myth is this: There is a small number of people out there for each
of us (and perhaps only one) whose natures are so sympatico with ours
that meeting one of them is like having an electric shock of recognition 
run through your frame as you realize: This Is The One I will spend all 
my days with. Many people, doomed never to meet their Perfect Mates,
settle for less. The implication is that marriage to a Perfect Mate is
based on True Love and is likely to last Forever since the initial
'magic' is bound to remain at its original intensity for an indefinite
period of time. 
The True Love myth may have had its origins in the courtly love 
tradition 'way back in the early middle ages. The relationship of a 
knight for his lady was supposed to be a mirror on earth of the 
relationship of a Christian to the mother of God. You might call it 
the ultimate pedestalization of woman. Books were written advising 
people on the proper approach to love; The Art Of Courtly Love by 
Cavalcanti is one famous book of the time, and Dante Alighieri's love 
for Beatrice as he described it in La Vita Nuova is also a model of 
this type of love. The idea is that these people were talking about 
a mystical and idealized form of love that was a lower-order form of 
the love a Christian was supposed to have for Mary, the mother of God. 
Now, this love was at the same time sexual, so you had a mixture of 
the sacred and the profane that the Church found quite threatening. 
It soundly condemned the courtly love 'fad,' and the medieval Trobadour 
was an almost Dylanesque figure operating at the fringes of what was 
respectable.
Needless to say, our current True Love myth retains a shadow of the
notion that lovers are striving for some idealized and quasi-mystical
state. Is this coincidence, or have we inherited a modified courtly
love tradition from medieval Europe through tradition and/or the arts?
I don't know. What's interesting in this context, however, is the
stylized nature of our OWN 'courtly love' myth and its similarity to
the medieval myth. If nothing else, it's a striking example of
convergent evolution (I suspect a more direct connection, however; I
just can't prove it yet).
Our attitudes toward love are also culture-bound. If you doubt this,
go take a good course or two in anthropology. Some languages (Japanese, 
for example, which uses a borrowed word) don't even HAVE a word that 
corresponds to our notion of romantic love. Some cultures view love as 
a form of mental illness whose sufferers are to be pitied until they 
get better. Other cultures view it as a phenomenon of adolescence that 
people outgrow. The belief in the 'magic' of love is hardly a cultural
universal. Many societies view the marital bond as a conjoining of
families; love has little or nothing to do with it.
If you doubt the reality and power of the True Love myth, spend a day 
listening to top-40 songs, reading romance novels, and watching 'romantic'
stories on the television. As a society, we're positively inundated by
pro-True Love propaganda. 
The result is that it's easy to look at rough spots in a relationship
or at a less-than-perfect SO after the initial sexual glow has worn
off and convince yourself that it wasn't True Love after all and
merrily go out to continue your search for the Real Thing. This may be
one of the reasons why so many people seem reluctant to WORK at a 
relationship with problems these days: it's much easier to convince
yourself it wasn't 'real' and go on to something else.
Will I fall in love again? Without a doubt. Will I get involved in
another long-term relationship? I won't rule it out. But I certainly
won't delude myself into thinking that our feelings for each other
will forever stay the same, or that the relationship won't involve
hard work and constant communication if it's to last. I'm not a cynic;
I simply don't have any illusions about what love is or how it works
its alleged 'magic.'

And that's probably as valid a reason for having a housemate as any
I've seen. It's certainly PRACTICAL, and many young people I've seen
setting up households could use a few lessons in practicality. ;-)

     Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I was going to post something like
this awhile ago, but decided to keep out of it.  It seemed so simple,
but people kept bring marriage into it, or complicating the issue.
All they had to see was that it was ""I am open to new (sexual)
relationships,"" vs. ""I am not open to new (sexual) relationships.""
     I think the problem was caused by people who were not so sure WHAT
their situation was... i.e. life can be very complicated.  Just because
you are seeing someone, it doesn't necessarily mean that you BOTH want
a commitment.  Nor does it mean that, even if you DO have some sort
of commitment, that you wouldn't mind slipping out of it when something
good comes along.  And you might feel guilty about it.  But you might
feel you want to preserve you INDEPENDENCE!  But, but, but... you can't
clasify people.  I might meet someone, and they might say to me ""I'm
not interested in a relationship at this time.""  Then, the next day,
they'll meet someone else and fall in love, and want a long-term
relationship.  It might be they didn't know until it happened.  It might
be they DID want one, but were hiding it from me so as not to hurt my
feelings, or hiding it from themselves so they wouldn't feel guilty
about not liking me (people, I find, generally WANT to like people).
     Anyway, I'm glad you posted this!

Let's turn that around: Once you learn *to* need someone else,
how do you learn to be happy alone?

This is worded slightly, but significantly than it usually is.
The version I usually hear is that you are supposed to be happy
BY yourself. (e.g. alone)  Bullmodems!  People are social critters,
we need friends, affection, love, etc.  Most people can handle being
alone for short periods of time, some can handle long periods.
(short and long being intentionally undefined)  But to claim that
everyone should be happy alone for long periods of time is totally
bogus.  Becky's version, however, I agree with.  You do need to be
happy with yourself to be truely happy with anything.  Which isn't
to say that one should avoid relationships until you are happy with
yourself.  The relationship may be exactly what you need to become
happy with yourself, avoiding it could be a catch-22 situation.

I agree that people can be quite happy with themselves and fail
miserably at giving (and some people I knew would never be able
to give/share regardless of the practice).  However *I* didn't 
read Bill's statement as being one that ""you're not ready to live
with anyone else until you've lived alone enough"".  I think living
with someone or alone is immaterial here.  For a relationship to 
succeed and grow both partners must be 'whole'.  If a person is
missing something in their own life, I don't think that they're 
going to be able to find it in someone else's life.  The solution
must come from within. So until the person has their own self 
respect, Bill is right a 'sustained and giving relationship' is 
not possible.

Thanks, William, for a really good note. Your response to pooh was
roughly what I was thinking when reading her note, but you expressed
yourself a lot better than I could have.
I seem to remember a Charlie Chaplin movie in which there was a song
which went, in its entirety, ""Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love
Love Love [repeated about forty times]"" (If anybody can remember
which movie it was, I'd appreciate the name). I think it summed up
our culture about as well as anything. Maybe the reason that Madonna's
song ""Material Girl"" became so popular is that its message, while
somewhat despicable, still provides a refreshing contrast to the
unrelieved insipidness of the fifty thousand other ""Love Love Love ...""
songs around.
To me, the funniest thing about the way this True Love myth has been
sold in US society is the way the private lives of some of the most
prominent people used to sell it have differed so wildly from the myth.
In many cases, you have the feeling that if these people had
deliberately tried to live a life as different from the myth they sold
as possible, they could not have done any better. Check out the life
of Rock Hudson. Or Doris Day. Or Elvis Presley. Or John Lennon. Or
go to a bookstore and sneak a look at Hollywood Babylon II. Before the
flames start arriving, I should say that I'm not criticizing any of
these people. They chose to live their life their way, and that's fine
with me. What I'm saying is that when you compare the reality of these
people's lives with the myth they were used to sell, this should raise
a question in your mind about the myth. Or give you a laugh, if you
like irony.
My feelings are that it's a bit much to expect my SO to give me a
regular dose of magic. I'll settle for someone who'll be a good
friend to me, and who is also willing to settle for someone who'll
be a good friend to her. We can then try to make each other happy
for whatever time we have on this earth until we kick the bucket.
(I imagine this all sounds pretty dull to y'all).

I know that this will shake up the net, but I agree with Bill's
posting one hundred percent. A relationship is a lot of work, and
has little to do with that strange chemical imbalance called 'love'
that occurs in the intial stages of some relationships.

quit reading net.singles).  So I figured I'd explain, in case you were
really interested, eventhough the original ""Nominally single???"" posting
has long since disappeared from our system.
By ""only nominally single"" I meant something very specific; I meant people
who have relationships that by their existence exclude other single people
in some sense from their lives, who would not be otherwise excluded.  These
are relationships that make them ""not single,"" such that they are single in

are ""not married"".
I include in this category people who, if you innocently say ""hi"" to them,

include people whose every posting contains the phrase ""X and I"", where X
is the poster's SO, as I feel such postings are particularly pernicious.
I guess I don't include the ""single parents"" posting here among the
""only nominally single,"" since I have yet to encounter one who is either
antisocial towards single people, or dogmatic in terms of how their
relationship is the ideal to which all other single people should aspire.

Bravo Pooh, keep these two in line.  They both have their sights set
at their own feet.  Granted, any relationship (anything for that matter)
worth having is worth working for.  When is the last time that you
had something *real special* just given to you?  To go as far as to
say that there is nothing magical about sex OR love is absolutely
ludicrous.  Isaac and Bill, if all you want your SO to be is a good
friend then you probably won't find *any* magic at all, in anything.
Any sapient being should be able to distinguish between lovers and
friends.
I think that there is a real return to romance in the 80's.  I have
read some interesting articles about this.  I will quote one in
a followup posting, it's good but looong.  The example of John
Lennon and Rock Hudson are really obscure Isaac.  What do you know
about their love lives?  How do you know that they didn't find
magic with their chosen partners?  Their lives ended tragically
but I don't know that their pursuit of love was in vain as you try
to make us believe.

I agree with that definition entirely. But that also applies nicely
to many married people, who seem incapable of identifying themselves
separately from their spouses. It is as if neither one trusts the
other enough to make friends independently. I have found it very
difficult to become friends with married women because of this. Most
of them just keep their distance. I dunno. Seems like a lonely kind
of life, just you and the old man, forever and ever....

I fail to see where sex and love are more than glandular responses and
bonding behavior, physical sensations that evolved to guarantee the
preservation of genetic material and mutual cooperation in the raising
of young. All the other stuff ('magic') is myth-making, something we
humans are all too good at. I don't deny that sex and love can lead to
some of the most pleasant physical and mental states the organism can
attain, and I don't think you see the point of what Isaac and I were
saying. I suggest you might want to reread our postings.
Do I think I will personally fall in love again? Yes. Do I think it
will be an overwhelming experience? Yes. Do I think those feelings
will last forever at their initial intensity? Probably not. Do I think
True Love has a magical property outside its obvious origins in
glandular secretions and chemical/electrical phenomena in the brain?
Definitely not.
>Isaac and Bill, if all you want your SO to be is a good
>friend then you probably won't find *any* magic at all, in anything.

Over the long haul, one's behavior toward an SO almost invariably changes.
The physical attraction may lessen or there may be other problems in
the relationship. What gets a couple through these rough spots? It
ain't the evanescent magic, it's FRIENDSHIP and mutual respect for the
value of the relationship.
As to the difference between lovers and friends, it's a quantitative
thing based on the importance of sexual attraction in the
relationship. If two people describe themselves as lovers, they either
have sex regularly in their relationship or they think about having
sex regularly in their relationship. If they describe themselves as
friends, they probably don't have sex regularly in their relationship.
These are just relative labels we use to tell other people something 
about our relationships and about our availability for new 
relationships, not labels that describe cut-and-dried phenomena.
 
>I think that there is a real return to romance in the 80's.  
I think you probably realize by now that at least some of us in this
group think this is unfortunate, especially if by 'romance' you mean
the reification of the True Love Myth.

I believe the need people are talking about originates in fear: the
fear that one can't make it on one's own, the fear that one will never
have another relationship like the one that's missing, etc. I wasn't
denying that the feeling that life has lost its savor is normal;
what's NOT normal is that feeling continuing beyond a finite period of
mourning. And I think the belief that such continued obsession is
normal is dangerous.

This again was my reaction to the word 'need' as you were using it,
and the 'you' here wasn't really meant to refer specifically to you,
Snoopy (God, am I REALLY talking like this to a cartoon character? :-), 
but to the general class of people who feel they 'need' a relationship. 
As to your previous article, I sometimes have a hard time keeping up
with who has said what in these exchanges and don't really have a
clear understanding of the Life Philosophies of all the participants.
So if I've misinterpreted your stance I apologize.
 
>The original used the word 'need', I left it in when turning it around.

That's one of the hazards of posting to the net: unless you're precise
about what you say (whoops, unless ONE is precise about what ONE says)
you're liable to misinterpretation. I believe you personally are not
obsessive about relationships, but don't assume the class of
net.singles readers in general are not. When a strong word like 'need'
is joined to 'relationship' it causes a lot of associations to spring
up in a net reader's mind. For me, it brings back painful and immature
postadolescent longings and fantasies I've long since grown out of, and 
my immediate reaction is to assume you're talking about the same thing.
The standard meaning of the word 'need' implies the needed something
is a prerequisite for happiness or health or well-being. As applied to
relationships, 'need' implies that a SO-less person is unhappy, unhealthy, 
and/or incomplete in some way. This was the sense of the word I was
strongly reacting to.

Ah, it seems you're evading the issue by redefining what we're talking 
about. Most people do not have the kind of relationship we were talking 
about (at least that I THOUGHT we were talking about) with their God 
or with nature or with their pets (unless they're kinky in the extreme, 
that is :-). I assumed we were talking about SEXUAL relationships, not 
general interactions with other living beings and inanimate objects. 
Apparently I was wrong. If this is the case, we've been talking about
two different things entirely.
But you'll also notice that I was addressing a particular ATTITUDE
toward relationships, the feeling that one MUST HAVE a relationship
with its associated insecurities (I'm not going to catalog them
again). It ain't the necessity of social intercourse I was talking
about but a longing and obsession that becomes a driving force in
one's life. A person whose entire life revolves around an obsession
with a house or a pet or a political cause is in just as much trouble
as a person who is obsessed with romantic relationships.
 
>Even if we limit the discussion to relationships with SOs, I

Of course they can be necessary. My postings on this topic have
questioned whether this kind of need is an entirely healthy state. I
say no, you apparently say yes.

>Being alone just isn't as satisfying after having an SO.

I've eaten at some fine restaurants, and had meals there that make all
other meals pale in comparison: food cooked to perfection, artfully
balanced and presented. Now, there were a few possible reactions
to these intense sensations of culinary pleasure: I could decide that
no other eating experience could match them and devote my life to the
pursuit of the most sublime and refined cuisine on the face of the
earth, bankrupting myself in the process and alienating my family and
friends as I pursued my obsession; I could decide that this experience
comes only a few times in a lifetime, and resign myself to comparing
my ordinary meals to the absolute perfection I've known once or twice
in life, knowing that nothing I ever eat will ever match the bliss I
know is possible; lastly, I could realize that I very well may eat a
meal that will match the perfection of the two or three I've known,
decide that this will be very nice if it happens but that I won't get
crazy about it, and decide to appreciate the simple joys of a bowl of
oatmeal and a cup of tea out on the porch as the sun's coming up.
In short, I strongly disagree that being alone isn't as satisfying
once you've had an SO.

It seems to me that you're talking about two different things here.
One is the seeming incapability of *some* married or involved people
to make friendships outside their primary relationships.  This could
be for many reasons.  The two most common are: 1) believing that it
is somehow improper to share anything with anyone else now that you
have an SO, and 2) simple reluctance to have more than one friend at
a time.  The second reason, although I disagree with it as it
applies to *my* life, is a choice some people have made.  The first
(and probably most common) is a twisting of social traditions and
should be gently challenged wherever appropriate.
But there seems to be something else that's being suggested in these
postings that I have some questions about.  Based on these postings
and other postings, I can see that people get offended when they
meet someone and that person mentions that they have an SO, as if to
warn the new acquaintance off or something.  Now I've been in that
situation and felt offended; I thought that my interest was purely
friendly and it was presumptuous of the person to think I was in any
way 'coming on' to him.  However, when there's no obvious outward
signs of your being ""taken"" (e.g., a wedding ring) and it looks as
though this friendship could go in either direction, at what point
is it appropriate to let someone know you're not available?
I'm not talking about meeting someone at work or in a professional
context; then, you should be nothing but professional.  But we often
meet people in social situations - situations in which it is common
to meet MOTAS and assume that they might be open to starting a
relationship.  My basic reason for going to a party is to enjoy
talking to people, maybe meet a few more, the usual.  But if I'm
also uninvolved at that time, I won't pretend that I might not be
seeking a potential SO.  So if I meet someone, I want to know as
soon as is reasonable what his 'status' is, so I won't get any false
hopes up.  (This may sound crass, but it's honest.)  I also assume,
perhaps incorrectly, that if a new acquaintanceship seems to be
heading in a potentially romantic direction, it is polite of me to
inform someone if *I'm* not available.
The way I try to do this is to somehow, as naturally as possible,
work in a mention of my SO, in a context that doesn't seem like I'm
saying, ""Look, bub, I'm taken, so back off.""  I think it's only
fair.  Maybe this appears to people as if I can't think of myself
except in terms of ""him and me,"" when, in fact, I'm only mentioning
it for their sake.
Let me put some caveats is here:  I don't assume that every man I
meet is 'after' me; it's pretty easy to read the subtext of a
conversation and tell what's what, so I only do it then.  If I miss
a few times, I'd rather err on the side of honesty than be accused
of leading someone on.
Most of the time it's a relief to get all the sexual stuff out of
the way right from the start, so we can simply enjoy really getting
to know one another.  It's a shame that it can't be that way from
the beginning, and anyone who's read my stuff in mail.feminist knows
that I don't subscribe to feminine/masculine roles, but that's the
way it is now so I try to deal with it as best I can.
So I guess my question, after all this long-winded nonsense, is
this: at what point would *you* like to be told that a new
acquaintance is 'unavailable'?

Consider a person like Mother Theresa, or anyone else who has
dedicated his/her life to helping the unfortunate. There are other
ways to achieve full enjoyment and fulfillment in life than through
a relationship with an SO, I believe. Since we're social beings, we
NEED other people; I'm not denying that. But I do deny that one needs 
a sexual/love relationship to be fully happy in life.

I don't really think it's a matter of keeping one's ""cool"" in a
relationship; one can fully experience passion in a love relationship
without abandoning one's good sense. And a shattered relationship
always hurts; it's how constructively one DEALS with the hurt that's
important, I think.
Anyone who decides to sign a marriage certificate without considering
the potential breakup of the relationship and its allied legal and
financial ramifications is a fool, for example. Being in love is no
excuse for abandoning one's ability to reason.

Apologies if I offend anyone's sensibilities with this, but the
sensation of orgasm is one of the most intensely pleasurable physical
sensations the organism is capable of. Evolution/God (pick your
favorite) has come up with an extraordinarily effective mechanism for
getting nervous systems to engage in reproductive behavior, n'est-ce
pas? Now imagine that it would be possible to experience this height
of pleasure continually, 24 hours a day. Would you choose to do so? I
certainly wouldn't: the intensity of orgasm for most humans is, I
think, enhanced by the experiences that precede and follow it. It
ain't as much fun without the dating, getting to know someone, the
pleasant evening and the foreplay, and waking up the next morning to
watch the sun rise together. Human experiences are, I think,
pleasurable in context, butted up against contrasting experiences (not
all of them as intense or pleasurable). Love would not be nearly as 
enjoyable if its intensity never lagged and picked up again, I think. 
You fall in love with someone, then the intensity of the experience 
decreases. But all of a sudden you see your partner turn in the light 
a certain way, or s/he says something that reveals a new strength or 
vulnerability, and Bingo: the feelings intensify back to where they 
were when you first met. After a relationship like this breaks up, 
everyday experiences can acquire a poignancy they don't ordinarily
have. For me, this can focus my attention on experiences I'd otherwise
ignore, and is an important part of getting through the mourning
process. It's a matter of learning to appreciate the little things
again for their own worth and stop measuring them against the
overwhelming intensity of the sensations that accompany what we call
love.

Right away, I guess. As Heather mentioned, it *is* better to get the
sexual stuff out of the way immediately. Of course, once that
happens, it takes some of the excitement out of the potential
relationship. 'Course, I have to admit it was more like nervous
tension and acid stomach than excitement. 
Actually, what would appeal to me most is being slammed up against a
wall by a new acquaintance and being told, ""Look, bub, I'm taken, so
back off."" There is just no chance of mis-understanding or
mis-interpretation by either party in that case...

Sigh.  I was mainly talking about ""romantic"" relationships, which

He whose breath reeks of Mo Shu Alpo:
Need for a relationship has little to do with maturity, immaturity,
machismo, or shoe size. (In this beagle's opinion, anyway) Bill is
claiming that the need for a relationship is unhealthy.  Whether it
is unhealthy or not, many people (and beagles!) do need a relationship,
and we have to deal with that need somehow.  Being told that you
don't need what you know good and well that you *do* need is less than
helpful.
You can say that what we ""need"" consists of oxygen, water, food,
and in most climates, clothing and shelter.  This is what we require
to survive, not to live.  What we require to live is not as easily
defined.  It varies from person to person, and from time to time
throughout our lives.  It is also difficult to detirmine what we
need verses what we merely want.
I've been attempting to write about people in general, not about
my specific case.  (I'm a little strange, and things that are
true for me are often not true for people in general.)  Perhaps
there's a better word than ""need"", perhaps there isn't.  I'm
not a writer, ok?
To satisify George's curiosity, yes, I feel that I need a relationship.
Perhaps this need wouldn't be so strong if society wasn't so strongly
couple oriented.  But with most people coupled and only interested
in doing things with their SO (and kids) there's really noone else
to do anything with.  And many people who are single don't want to
""waste"" time with someone who ""isn't going to work out"".  And to add
insult to injury, the VAXen are usually down for backups on Friday
nights, so I can't even read usenet!  :-\
The answer changes if we use George and Bill's definition of
relationship. (relationship = sex) I *think* that for me, sex is
on the top of the ""want"" list, rather than on the ""need"" list.
But I'm not sure at this point.  Coming up with a more definite
answer will require extensive research.  :-)

You have a problem here.  Finding out that someone is attatched (assuming
that you haven't been having an affair with someone for a year before
finding out that they were married, something which happened to a friend
of mine, or something of that nature) should not be painful.  Mildly
disappointing, okay -- pain - no.
Pain means *big disappointment*.  You will get enough big disappointments
in your life without going out of your way to get more.  If you make a
big emotional investment in ``being able to be the SO of person X'' then
you are asking to get hurt when person X isn't interested.  You are
asking to get crushed when person X agrees to go out and then decides after
a few dates that you aren't really all that compatible.  Stop setting
yourself up so much.  You will end up believing that the world is horrid
and painful and rotten; you may end up stuck between believing that the
world owes you a {living date} and full of resentment because you aren't
getting it.  it is a real sad and painful trap.
The way out of it is to not care so much whether any particular person you
are interested in is interested in you.  There are lots of ways to
organise this to accomplish this effect.  ALready having a SO is the
easiest, but we have a bit of a bootstrapping problem here.  Asking lots
of people out is another  good solution.  Or finding something you like
more than dating.  (( zillion people will tell you that you are crazy to
like anything more than meeting attractive members of the appropriate
sex, but ask yourself this -- how happy are they?))
Good luck!

No! No!  This is a big misconception!!  One of the great media-lies is that
people in love are kept together by their deep love (read emotional
dependence) upon each other. This is simply not the case.  A sense of
humour is much more useful in keeping a relationship together.
Speaking personally, and for the ``already had several relationships''
crowd, that emotional investment is a big turn off.  When I meet
someone who is obviously infatuated with me I want to be as nasty as
possible to that person so as to stop this disease as soon as possible.
After all, if we just met, they can not have much of an idea as to what
I am really like (yea, even if they have been readin me for 5 years on
usenet!).  What they are doing is trying to stuff me into their image of
``the ideal lover'' and they are seriously in love with that ideal.
Rather than being impressing, this is a real drag.  Even if I wanted to
live for the sake of someone who has all that investment in me (which
I assuredly do not!) I couldn't.
This is really sad.  What I am looking for in new people is that they
are interesting as people.  If I get an evening of good conversation
out of any new people, then I am pleased.  if I get someone whom I can
respect I get someone that I am likely to look up again and again.
It is difficult for me to work up respect for anyone who is desparate
for a relationship.  I feel that I am getting railroaded.  What I want
is dinner, conversation and good times.  If you turn out to be a lot
of fun to be with then I am goign to want to spend more time with you.
But if you are desparate for a relationship, then you are going to be
not very much fun to be with and I am going to spend my time elsewhere.
Rememeber the adage where the girl ``plays hard to get''?  This is 
deceitful little con whereby girls (all who are presumed to be
desparate for a relationship) decieve the guys who don't want to be
clung to that they are not clingining until the poor guy gets so
intrigued that he ends up marrying someone for the difficulty involved.
This business of viewing someone as a trophy to be won turns my stomach,
but there is a point here.  This scam worked!  How come?  Because for any
reasonable (read not-love-desparate in addition to whatever else you call
reasonable) person a big display of need is a turn off.
As you go on in life, you want someone who can help share the load of
life's trials and aspirations.  You don't want someone who is so
desparate that in addition to holding your own shit together you have
to be the emotional support for them as well.  (As a temporary thing,
supporting a loved one is a great and reasonable thing.  As a day in and
day out vocation it is hell on earth.)
The only thing to be said for this approach is that it is likely to
work on very young and inexperienced women/girls.  There is something
very wrong about how women are raised.  All of them in this society
get some of a very bad brainwashing trip which says ``the function of
woman is to nurture the emotionally wounded''.  It is not the case that
most women enjoy this nurturing -- mostly they resent it like crazy but
feel that they ``have'' to do it.  if you go out projecting ``I'm
emotionally wounded -- I need a relationship'' you will probably catch
someone who will start the nuturing end of this trip without thinking.
If this is what you want....

You missed it.  I *don't* think that the world ain't so hot.  However, I
was only able to reach this enlightened position *after* deciding that
I was going to stop being so desparate for a relationship and so resentful
that I was only getting lousy ones (or none at all).  You can't help but
get resentful if you are getting rejected all the time.  But if the rejection
is in your mind (because you set yourself up) then it is also easy to fix.

I think not. Look, I'vve done this before. Everybody eats.   Whether you
go to McDonalds or eat at home or eat fancy, all you have to do is ask
a different person out to dinner every night for a month and I am sure
that you will have a much wider selection of interesting people to think
about then you have now.  I did this once.  I ended up with a lot of good
eats and 3 good friends.  it works, given that you are going to eat
anyway it is relatively cheap, and it gives you something to do while you
consider how intersting this person you have gone out with is.
By the way this ``go out with one person at a time'' is a big high school
thing that needs dropping as soon as possible.  In the old high school
days (or at least my old high school days -- maybe people have changed
since then)  you measured your status by whom you were going out with.
And *anybody* was better than *nobody*.  So if you started going out
with someone you had to ``break up'' with them before you could go out
with someone else since it was the status of the relationship that was
important, not the people.  Now that you have survived high school you can
get all teh status you want by being a damn good programmer/designer/
whatever it is that you do or by being a good dancer or any number of
things which are all better than ``who is your steady''.  So you can
start going out with people for the sake of the people rather than the
sake of a relationship.  If you know 3 neat people who happen to be
of the opposite sex, you can go out with all of them and enjoy them as
people.  I know that this is a big high-school no-no and is to some
extent perpetuated by the great American Love Myth, but in the real
world this stuff is *ok*.
If you go out with a lot of people, the only person who will think that
you are a reject is *you*.  There is no big social stigmata about this.
There are circles where it will be assumed that for some reason you
want to get laid by lots of different woemn, but even those aren't all
that common.  Most people are really not all that preoccupied with you
to notice that you are going out with a lot of people (outside of
high school, where everybody is bored, people find more interesting
things to do than keeping statistics on each other).  it will be assumed
that you want a lot of variety in your life, and a great many people
(including me) will find you intriguing.  If you know lots of people
then you are probably broad enough as a person to be very interesting
and if you keep going out with lots of different ones then you must
have high standards (or you would have clung to the first one that was
reasonable to you).  There are 2 points in your favour.  If I end up
not liking you all that much I know you must be able to take it (since
you have had a lot of practice in gracefully ending dinners at this point).
If I knew this about you I would go out to dinner in a minute.  I may be a
bad example, since I go out to dinner with almost anybody who asks me since
I am confident that I can handle any sort of situation that can arise
(because, sigh, I *have* already...) but for people with less gusto than
I do you would still be a good bet.
You will loose out on the most clinging people (who will be afraid of your
presumed independence) and on the people who are terrified that anybody
who asks them out to dinner is going to rape them, but I wouldn't call that
much of a loss.
It is fairly ironic that the people who are most deparate for love are
also the hardest to love.  If you tone down the desparation then you become
much more attractive.  This is a difficult lesson to learn.

  No, but they often only seem concerned about how the particular insecurity
in question affects *women*, which can often cause others to think that's
all they notice, instead of being concerned with how it affects *people*. 
This ""exclusive"" attitude tends to drive men and women further apart, which
as far as I understand it is *not* one of the goals of the feminist 
movement. :-) This attitude also tends to discourage men from participating
in the feminist movement, even those who may be in line with most of the
goals of that movement.

  I suspect that this is in *general* true due to differences in society's
expectations of men and women, but of course there are always individual 
variations.
> You'll rarely see a man say ""Anything you say dear"" and MEAN it.  
  That depends on what ""MEAN it"" means. Often people willingly sacrifice their
own ""self-interest"" on a specific issue because it is more important to someone
they care about than it is to them. I really don't think this is sex-specific.
My experience is that *all* people do this to a greater or lesser extent
dependent on the individual. I have seen nothing to indicate more of a tendency
for one sex to do this than the other.

	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not
having sex with them.
Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most
likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS.  That simply isn't true.
It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.

Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Last I heard there's no medical evidence for this.  My information  may  be

Giiiiive me a breaaaaak!
Anyway, I do have a question about the original posting.
What's the criterion that's used for distinguishing between
'possibly safe' and 'safe' acts? Are 'possibly safe' acts
ones that have not caused any known cases of aids but may
as far as we know lead to transmission of the virus? Or what?

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted
out of the New York Post or some similarly inane publication?  I mean,
you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the 
posting were about something which affected only women, then it would
make some sense.  How about a posting on how *pregnancy* is incurred,
with detailed descriptions of sex acts.  Go on.  I DARE you. Nyaa-Nyaa-Nyaa.

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed
Matt Crawford!  HA!  Now I can leave you wondering whether I've 
actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never
lepton his hadron, excited his fundamental modes, accepted an
injection of hot magma into my steaming caldera, intersected his
orbital, or even licked his throbbing popsicle.  
I will still maintain that a discussion of AIDS is inappropriate
for this newsgroup, not because it affects more men than women,
but because it is fundamentally absurd to assume that a classification
of people based on sex makes sex a primary concern.

If they are shared by both sexes then definitely.  There is a newsgroup called
'net.med' specifically for medical issues.  You should use that.

These kind of remarks are uncalled for.  This guy was making a genuine point
that these issues are NOT to do with women alone so keep your accusations to
yourself.

Well, Ross, this isn't MY experience  (except at a few computer conferences
:-).
There is a paperback out entitled <The Great American Man Shortage and
What You Can Do About It>.  Now, I haven't had the training to be very
critical about statistical methods, so all I will say in support of the
thesis is that it does match some of my perceptions with some reasonable
supporting data.  General disclaimer:  I read this book about a year
ago, and promptly recycled it to make room for more unread books.
Essentially, as we get older, there are FEWER men ""available"" for partnering
for a variety of sociological and biological reasons.  More female babies
were born, a higher childhood mortality rate for males, and a shorter life
expectancy for males in general are cited as the major biological reasons
(and they call US the weaker sex?).  The sociological reasons have to do
with girl-children being socialized to ""marry up"", combined with women
(particularly we baby-boomers) doing well in our own right, 
making ""up"" even higher, and therefore, decreasing further the number of
""available men"".
I don't know how old you are Ross, but it seems it's only a matter of
time before your situation changes.  Or is it a matter of attitudes?
I didn't find anything too illuminating in the ""what to do about it""
section, though it may provide some good suggestions for those of you
who want to investigate new ways of meeting singles.

This must be one of the reasons that, traditionally, women have been
counselled to marry young.  Also, consider the importance so many men
place on a woman's looks -- younger women are usually better looking.

Come on!  Does one REALLY need to be SOCIALIZED to want to marry up?
That's like being socialized to like candy.

See the discussions in net.social about Affirmative Action for women
and the principle of Comparitive Worth (the idea that traditional
""women's jobs"" should offer salaries equal to ""men's jobs"" of comparable
difficulty).  Should women one day find full equality in the workplace,
your problem will only get worse.

When I worked in NYC, I'd sometimes hit the singles bars with my
friends after work.  At these places, the men at ususally outnumbered
the women by about seven to one.  This was also the story at the
""singles"" parties I attended.  Perhaps women have such a difficult

if they spend most of their spare time sitting at home with girlfriends
talking about draperies and stuff.

It bothers me that women complain about the lack of ""available men"" when,
in fact, part of the problem is their own desire to ""marry up"".  Though
I can't really blame women for marrying up if they have the opportunity
(everyone is a bit of an opportunist at least) I find it difficult to
stomach men being blamed when a woman can't find someone to ""marry up"" to.
Sure, it's not the woman's fault that she was socialized to want that,
but if it becomes a problem, why blame the men for not being good enough?
I'm not sounding off at Moira in particular, just the attitude that the
situation is tough on women but they bear no responsibility for it, that
somehow men are failing them.
I read a particularly annoying article about this a few years ago.
It went on and on about the lack of suitable men.  But in one place it did
admit that, statistically, there were more unmarried men than women up until
the age of 29 or so, even though many of the woman readers of the article
would be younger than that.  And it contained one example that particularly
upset me.  A single woman decided to have a party, inviting a number of
single men and women.  The article went on to say that ""there was only
one really interesting man there - a surgeon - and all the women arranged
themselves around him, hanging on his every word"".  Now, how did they think
the other men felt about this?  How many of the women who were complaining
about the quality of men were surgeons themselves?
I think a lot of the problem is the attitude of the women.  If a woman
can find a man to ""marry up"" to, fine - that is her priviledge.  If she
can't find a man who is her equal, she has my sympathy.  But if she
rejects men who are her equals because she is looking for someone ""better"",
she has my anger.
(As a man, it is difficult looking for someone who is your equal if the
women who *are* your equals are all looking for someone better.)
Another thought: if a woman does ""marry up"", explicitly seeking someone who
is ""above"" her in status, should she then have any reason to expect him to
see her as an ""equal""?

WHAAAT?????  Not going to singles bars is a damned sight different from ""not
going out""!
Since I have a girlfriend, I'm currently ""not looking"", but if I were, a
singles bar is about the last place I'd go to.  I'm involved in a number of
activities that I like to do for their own sake.  But interestingly enough,
these activities have considerably better boy-to-girl ratios than
seven-to-one!

That sounds sexist to me.  Most women I know are pretty career-oriented, and
are not particularly likely to ""spend most of their spare time sitting at
home with girlfriends talking about draperies and stuff"".

Gimme a break, huh?  You want to make a claim here that you've never
been lonely on a Friday night?  Or that you prefer not to be involved with
someone?  I tend to think that most people prefer to be involved with
someone as it (to me at least) is a lot more fun to share one's life
with someone else.  And I tend to find it to be more comfortable to
share my life with a women.  Call me sexist, if you wish.
And the idea wasn't that there was a man on the other side of the door.
But rather that (generally speaking) a man is gonna knock on your door
a hellofalot more often than you'll knock on his.
And breaking up from a relationship is difficult for all involved, BTW,
so get off your ivory tower!

Nope. I didn't forget.  I just figured that the *theory* I stated
might be accepted as a possible theory, and that it wouldn't be attacked
as if this were some sexist debate.   If you feel that makes me
""*that* insensitive and chauvinistic"", then ""Gosh, Mrs. Cleaver, I
sure do apologize.  I certainly didn't mean to make you think.""

Quite right.  But I ALSO mentioned singles parties, sponsored by
groups like ""Young Singles of (your town)"".  I also took classes
(such as acting/improvisation) and attended various hobby clubs
(such as Toastmasters Club).  The ratio at these other activities
was not as bad as 7/1, but women WERE a distinct minority even here.
Women SHOULD be a MAJORITY at these places, if the ""manshortage theory""
were true.

I don't get that Moira said anything about ""marrying up""
socially.  Personally, I have nearly always dated men
from two to ten years older than myself because I find
I have more in common with them.  And it is true that
as time goes on, the number of (available)
men in that category decreases.
If I did in fact misinterpret your words, Moira,
forgive me!
If I were to ""marry up"" *professionally* (not necessarily
socially), it would be because I want to marry someone I
can respect, who I feel can do things that I can't.
So what's wrong with this?  My own personal taste is
such that I admire good hacking more than good baseball
playing.

What aspect of aggressiveness to you ask about?  Showing personal interest?
Showing physical desire? I personally have no problem with the kind of
aggressiveness (assertiveness?) that the young lady (in >>) displayed.
However, there was another woman whom I met that was aggressive about
wanting sexual intimacy.  Now, my particular beliefs are to abstain and so
that kind of forwardness was unwelcome.  Even after discussing our differences
on the subject, she made it quite clear that she would not see me exclusively
unless we slept together at some point. Mind you, I do indeed have desires,
and this one was not easy to say goodbye to as we got along so well in other
facets.  I am sure that I'm not the only guy that has been in this reversal
of roles. If it hadn't been so difficult to part company I could laugh at the
comedy of it...
In the past, however, when I have ""partaken"", I did enjoy the aggressiveness
of a woman.  Rather than feeling inhibited by it, I felt that it was out of
a desire for me and took as a compliment (to put it mildly). Hence, I look
forward to a wife that effectively communicates what's on her mind!

I admire aggressive/assertive women over timid ones.  They won't let anyone
push them around and they take a stand on what's important to them.  However,
if a/a implies bull-headedness or bitchiness, then count me out. An open mind
and an assertive nature is a winning combination.

You might enjoy the following passage from ""Miss Manners' Guide to
Excruciatingly Correct Behavior"":
    Other so-called inventions turn out to be cases of historical
    ignorance.  Take, for example, the ""modern"" matter of ladies
    asking gentlemen for dates.  Have you never heard of ""I find I have
    an extra theater ticket for Thursday night""?  Yet one is constantly
    hearing of ladies who are puzzled about how to take the initiative
    and gentlemen who are bewildered about how to respond.  Many ladies
    are unable to take no for an answer, and many gentlemen unable to
    give it.
 
    The roles of the pursuer and the pursued are well known in society, and
    there is no excuse for those who have practiced one side to botch things
    and plead ignorance when playing the opposite part.  Miss Manners has no
    objection to a lady's initiating a social engagement, provided she does
    so in the dignified, straightforward way that ladies have always
    appreciated in gentlemen.  This means that one suggests a specific date
    and activity, and is gracious if it is declined.  After three separate
    refusals, one stops asking.  Gentlemen should realize that it is
    perfectly proper to refuse such an invitation politely if one is not
    interested, and that elaborate excuses need not be given.
 
    Why is it, then, that a lady who knows what it is to be pestered with
    unwanted attentions does not know how to shrug and accept fate when her
    advances do not meet with success?  Neither continued pursuit nor bitter
    behavior is gentlemanly, she should know.  A gentleman, who knows what a
    rebuff is, will sometimes yield to the attentions of someone he doesn't
    really enjoy simply because he feels put on the spot at having been
    asked.  He should know that it is a lady's prerogative to say no.  They
    should both know that sexual attentions should never be demanded or
    given out of the disgusting notion that they are a return to the person
    who pays the entertainment bills.
 
    You see, Miss Manners has nothing at all against modern trivial
    variations on behavior, provided the traditions are observed.

'Tain't so, Frank. What's attractive to you may not ring my bells at
all. If most less-than-attractive women were 'more or less ignored,'
we'd be awash in what our parents' generation called Old Maids and
Bachelor Gentlemen. Instead, springtime rolls around each year and a

ordinary looking or even ugly Janes. Many men are strongly attracted 
to women you or I would find totally unattractive. It's instructive to 
check out a few of the kinkier personal ads in your local 
'counterculture' newspapers. Someone recently told me she'd seen an 
advertisement for women with large and prominent veins. There are even 
porno magazines that specialize in grossly obese women for certain 
men with special tastes. Chacun a son gout.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,

	Well, like I said, I wish that I were more than I am, if I am at
all. (Got that?) I wouldn't want to remain totally mysterious once I got
to know someone, although it's always nice to keep someone guessing a
little. Adds spice.

I've been told that I have very intense and intriguing eyes and that
such mysterious men are quite attractive etc etc.  Usually this ends up
with a sensual kiss and my friend sighing....  ""Oh Sting... Oh Sting...""
It's kind of an ""in joke"" but you understand.
Mystery adds some spice and the motivation to find out more.  The fun
is in getting there you see.

Sometime last year I brought up the idea that many men
and women are not aware that the opposite sex is JUST
LIKE THEM.  Human wants and needs are pretty much
universal.  The only difference might be in some cases
that women and men are taught to go about fulfilling
and communicating their needs differently; that's all.
What would I gain my being ""mysterious""?  Maybe some kind
of hold over someone who was trying to figure me out,
but that's not my idea of a relationship.  Being mysterious
would mean that I wasn't understood, and the one thing I
want most from a relationship is to be understood.

I remember answering something to this effect on a psychological test
battery when I interviewed several years ago with the ""Government"". 
I don't know whether that was the ""right"" answer, but I was offered
the job. 
More to the point, do you (out there) really believe that? I'd like to,
but I can honestly admit that I never treat male and female friends
(friends at the same level of intimacy) exactly the same. I try to, but
there seem to be, for example, certain topics or activities that are reserved 
for one group or the other that needn't be: career discussions, personal
problems, personal views. 
Any comments, or am I really just reacting to different levels of closeness
in friendships.

	Well, it depends. If you mean genetically, then I don't think that
there is any difference between men and women, intellectually or
emotionally. There are of course differences physically - men are
generally stronger than women, women can take more pain than men, etc.
But I don't think that's what pooh meant. But socially, I would say that
generally, although there are exceptions, men are different than women.
What I mean by that is that because of the way children are raised
depending on whether they are male or female, they are taught certain
social traits, and those are hard, if not impossible, to get rid of no
matter how ""liberated"" you become later in life. Like I said  though,
there are exceptions. I've found myself to be more emotionally and
intellectually compatible with men than with women, in general. 95% of
my friends are men. My best friends have always been men. In fact, at
the moment I have only one, maybe two, women friends who I would call
close friends, besides my sister. The situation with most of my
friendships with women is that we know each other only on a very surface
level. If we try to communicate on any deeper level there is usually
either disagreement or just plain incomprehension. Don't get me wrong -
I certainly don't dislike women in any way. I thoroughly enjoy being a
woman and have never wished that I weren't (although there was one woman
who did make me wish that I were a man... but that's a different story.)
It's just that for some reason I don't become close friends with women
very often. So I think that although genetically men and women are not
different emotionally or intellectually, society molds most people
enough that you can't really say that there is no difference between men
and women.

Recent readers of net.women have been treated to the assertion that men are
very different, since they want power and dominance, while women don't...
(Personally I'm unconvinced either way - the women I know are not mysterious
at all, nor do they desire to be)

parts of this discussion so I hope that this isn't a repeat. It seems to
me that our society produces two catagories of personalities, which I
will refer to as heart to heart and head to head. 
The heart to heart type of person tends to express emotions freely (at
least to others of their type) and are fairly willing to allow others of
their type to know what will hurt them.  These people tend to be more
willing to express their emotions frequently, so they tend to release
pent-up emotions more easily than the head to head type.  This type
tends to appear more emotional and is usually emotionally stronger.
This is type seems to be dominant in women.
The head to head type of person tends not to show weakness to others of their
type.  They may be open about most of their feelings, but usually
exclude their vulnerable side from this openness (often leaving the
impression that such does not exsist, if possible).  This type is often 
proud, and would often prefer to hide weakness or problems to the point
of discomfort or injury rather than allow weakness.  This type tends to
try to deal with most significant emotional problems internally, thus
often having bad feelings bottled up inside with no release.  This type
tends to appear externally tougher but is in fact weaker.  This type
seems to be dominant in men.
This is not to say that there aren't men who I would categorize as heart
to heart or women as head to head, on the contrary, it is fairly common
for people to cross the traditional lines.  It seems to me, though, that
sometimes these heart to heart men and head to head women tend have
trouble being accepted by the more traditional members of their same
sex.  I think it is because people can accept a different personality
type more easily when they have a sexual difference to which to
attribute it.
Well, that's my two cents.  Let them be well spent.

Putting my comment back into context, I did add that men
and women (in my view) have the same basic needs and wants,
but that they are taught to go about getting them and
communicating them in a different fashion according to their
gender.  I believe that's basically what you're saying,
Lady G.
>I've found myself to be more emotionally and

So do I.  Of those women friends I'm close to, almost
all of THEM have more male friends than female ones too.
Any ideas as to why this is so?  What makes these types
of women more compatible?
>So I think that although genetically men and women are not

The point I was trying to make was that, getting back to
the things that drive both men and women, there is little
difference except in their outward manifestations, which
are moulded by society.  I have known men (and women) who
use the outward differences as an excuse for not getting to
know the person underneath--on the premise that ""it's 
impossible to understand them anyway.""

You're right Phil.  Women have Rambo fantasies too--like being dropped
off in Afghanistan or Iran and single handedly toppling the Ayatollah.
That's why they had a woman in Rambo Part II.  Too bad she got killed...

I don't treat conversations with my male friends any differently than
I do my female friends.  We talk about all the same things whether
it is personal relationships, sex, jobs, family, etc..  The only time
I don't talk about the same things is when I don't feel 100% comfortable
around a person (will he understand? type of thing)  I feel if a person
is a true friend you should be able to talk about anything regardless of
the topic.  If there are topics that you can't bring up because of pride
or a sense that they aren't appropriate then I don't feel there is a true
friendship.  I think that with friends you should be able to be yourself
no matter how you really are without having to worry about what you say.
I don't think that a person's sex should make a difference on the level
of intimacy involved.  I prefer to tell things to both sexes to get
both a man's opinion on the situation and a female's view (they can
really differ).  I think this can give you a better and more overall
outlook than just always talking to the same sex about the same things.

How about baseball? (;-)).
Seriously, I'm not so sure that I go along with the abovestated sentiment.
Many of my friends have different interests, and non-interests as well,
and I notice that I talk about different things with them as a result.

and did people on the net find they left personal topics to be

my answer was i felt i could talk to members of either sex about

	I've also heard that women's and men's fantasies differ. Another
difference that I've heard is that men fantasise about specific people,
whereas women either fantasise about their SO, or about faceless people
or men that they create in their mind. I found that difference
interesting because I always do the former rather than the latter. 
	I found the above differences fascinating also because my fantasies
always fall into the first catagory. I couldn't care less about romance
(at least as far as my fantasies are concerned) although atmosphere
occasionally has a place, depending on the fantasy. But details are of
the utmost importance. Certain words are wonderful, and I could write a
book about clothing (capes, fishnet stockings, high heels, etc.)
although I must admit, a nipple under a sweater doesn't do much for me.
	There is something else that I'm curious about. In my fantasies how
I'm dressed, what I say, etc. is just as important to me, usually, as
how the man looks, what he says, etc. (That's what I meant by the heels
and fishnet stockings - no, seeing them on a man would not turn me on!)
I'm wondering if that's usually the case. Or if that's peculiar to men,
generally, since they concentrate on details (at least according to the
above sources) or if that's rather infrequent and I do it because my
fantasies are extremely detailed, that is, from what I've read and heard
of other people's fantasies mine usually go into more detail. This could
be because I'm the type of person that always pays great attention to
detail, or possibly because I write a lot and try to write everything,
including my fantasies, as clearly as possible. Or it could be that when
I discuss fantasies with another person they just hold back more than I
do. I have been told that I'm a bit, uh, unihibited when it comes to
sex. I've just never been able to figure out if that's a compliment or
not. ;-)

Interesting; I find that as soon as I start fantasizing specific
details, my mind wanders and my attention [and whatever] flags, unless
there is a specific person involved in which case I fantasize whatever
makes them special (i.e. what turns me on about them).  But I tend to be
a ``realist'', and don't allow much slack for fantasies, anyway, unless
the fantasies are somehow come pretty close to reality.  I guess this
comes from the (probably false) idea of having only a limited quantity
of imagination.  Funny thing is, the *hottest* ``fantasies'' for me are
really just fond memories.  And I guess one fantasy might be that this
situation is reciprocal...
Am I strange, or what?

You might try getting them a carpet with a thick padding.
That may cut down on the noise.  Perhaps some kind of acoustic
tile on your ceiling would help.  However, you should at least
discuss the problem with your housemate.  Perhaps they can be
a bit quieter if it is late at night.

I recall how a humorous but serious advice columnist whose opinions I seem
never to escape from once gave advice on how to handle this problem with
regards to a neighbor; by writing a courteous note saying, ""Hello, I am
your neighbor from next door.  I couldn't help but notice that your new
pet, which you keep in the room next to my bedroom at night, seems to make
a considerable amount of noise late at night.  Since it has gone on for
some time, I was concerned that perhaps you had not heard it, and that it
might be in some kind of distress.  Since I am quite fond of animals
myself, I hope you will understand my mentioning this to you.""
I must admit she put it much more succinctly and tactfully than I have done,
but I'm sure you see the general idea.  A note works much better than saying
it in person, since it avoids a potentially embarassing reaction from the
other person, if they realize at once what you are referring to.
However, having lived downstairs from similar people when I was in college,
I can understand how

My experience in similar situations has been that talking it over with  the
others  involved  is  the best solution.  They may not be aware that others
can hear them (and may be somewhat embarrassed when they  find  out).  They
probably don't realize they're causing you a significant problem.  I expect
they don't want to regulate your sleep any more than you want  to  regulate
their sex.  Working out some mutually acceptable compromise is probably the
best bet.

I can understand how you feel.  I used to have the same problem
with an old roommate (although my bedroom was not directly under
his, but on the same floor).
The 'only' way I was able to deal with it was to introduce some
interference (such as a TV set or a stereo).  It doesn't have to
be loud (in fact I wouldn't suggest that you try to blow them out
with sound unless you want to create friction :-)), but just enough
so that you can hear it over the ... ahem .... noise.  The idea is
to get your mind to pay closer attention to something else.
Hope it works (or at least helps)...

To help you sleep, you might try earplugs.  Another alternative
is white noise (e.g. the hum of one of those cheap air cleaners).
I have no idea what you could do to keep from getting jealous, however.
In elementary school, whenever a kid tried chewing gum or eating in class,
the teacher would ask, ""Did you bring enough for everybody?""
I don't know if that would work in your case.	:-)

WRONG!  This is true only for the shy types.  I used to live at a place
where the two of them were very noisy.  I dropped hints about it, and
the girl was the one who talked candidly about it.  I don't like to talk about
sex, unless I'm involved :-), but I did convey to them the fact that it
kept me awake.  They knew, but it didn't stop them from having a good time.

Sanford.  (It may not be readily obtainable, having been published circa 1973
by Paulist Press.)  Squarely based on the psychological work of Carl Jung and
his followers, this explored how each person has within him or her an
""invisible partner"", a feminine or masculine (respectively) side of the
personality.  He used the terms ""anima"" for the feminine side of a man, and
""animus"" for the masculine side of a woman.  A couple of interesting points
from the book (not quotes, just digests from memory):
Many people have difficulty integrating this opposite-gender piece of
themselves into their total person, despite the fact that (though they don't
realize it) both the person and the anima/us want to come together.  What 
people do instead is project their ""invisible partner"" out onto a MOTOS and
""fall in love"" with her/him -- only to be dreadfully let down when they
discover that the MOTOS is a) a human being, neither divine nor perfect,
b) not a match to their fantasies -- because not their anima/us.  In other
words, if you become terrifically infatuated with someone, it would pay to
look at yourself and/or at the image you have of the other person to see
what aspect of your ""invisible partner"" is actually trying to get out and
be accepted.
The book also discussed (in general) situations where the anima dominates the
man.  (The author did not have sufficient experience studying women to talk
much about the animus dominating the woman, but similar principles would
apply.)  The result is a sort of homogenized, feminized masculinity.  Two
manifestations of this dominance by the ""invisible partner"" are:
1) Homosexuality.  If the masculine side (which naturally desires union with
   the female) has been suppressed, the feminine (which wants the male) will
   come out.  Many of the favorable qualities of the feminine may also come
   out (e.g. I have done many theatrical productions with a man who is the
   sweetest-tempered person I know, and I'm pretty sure he's gay).
2) ""Dr. Zhivago"":  A man who is, more than most, attuned to the wants and the
   thinking of women; an ""initiate of the Great Goddess""; a man who seems
   fated to an unusual degree of self-knowledge; the ""Dr. Zhivago"" type (I
   must read that book now, to find out exactly what this means!).  This type
   of man is likely to have difficulty integrating, not the feminine, but the
   masculine side of himself into his total personality, having learned early
   to prefer the feminine and reject the masculine.  Being myself a man of
   this type, integrating the masculine side of me into my total consciousness
   has been recently one of the priority items in my own growth.
A person who has succeeded in integrating the masculine and feminine sides
(perhaps without even being very aware of the issue) can be quite a beautiful
person, e.g. a man who is definitely masculine, yet has the gentleness and
considerateness which are archetypally feminine: a man like Dave Seifert.

While a lot of what you extracted from ""The Invisible Partner"" was
quite interesting, one thing worth watching out for when making statements
like that is the erroneous stereotyping that such thinking promulgates.
Who is to say what behaviors are ""unmasculine"" (not ""right"" for a male),
""unfeminine"" (not ""right"" for a female), or for that matter, feminine
and masculine?  I think a lot of people reject certain elements of
their personalities (like sensitivity in men, or assertiveness in women)
because they subscribe to the notions that these behaviors are inappropriate
for their sex, and that's a great big pompous load of selfdamaging bullshit!
Some people even go so far as to say ""I have behaviors or feelings that are
'against' the nature of my sex [whatever that is!], therefore I *must* be
a homosexual, or a transsexual, or who knows what"".  You are what you are,
and anyone who tells you that certain parts of you exclude you from (or

Jeff, welcome back.  Too bad you haven't changed a bit in your capacity
to infuriate me and spread misinformation about gay people.  The idea that
being gay is somehow isomorphic with the manifestation of the feminine
is an old old canard, and totally discredited.  What's more your phrasing
is downright insulting: ""...the feminine (which wants the male) will
come out ... Many of the FAVORABLE qualities of the feminine may ALSO come
out.""   Gaaaakkk, spare us.  Wonderful, too, that you have discovered
a second classification for the ""problem"" of the ""anima"" so you needn't
be stigmatized with the ""problem"" of ""homosexuality.""
Note that I'm not arguing with the issue that some men may display
qualities which are traditionally considered ""feminine"", but rather that
1.) this reflects more on the classification system than on the person.
2.) this issue is entirely orthogonal to the person's sexual preference.
Why do I bother here?  Frankly, I don't know, for I'm losing patience.
Still, this kind of misinformation, whether malicious or not, needs to be
addressed and corrected whenever it is presented in a public forum.
Jeff Sargent, more than anyone else, has been responsible for foolish
statements about gay people in the midst of his public self-analysis.
Too bad Jeff seems incapable of showing sensitivity in this issue,
for he does it again and again and again and again...  
Flame, you bet this is a flame.  Jeff just can't seem to get away
from the ""gay"" thing, generally posed in the form of a statement about
gay people (invariably perjorative) loosely tied to an issue he is
currently struggling with.  We had to put up with this for MONTHS
last year, and I'm frankly sick of it.  
Hey, I must have left my ""sweet-temper"" at home.

I ran into an interesting variation of this several years ago.  My wife
(now ex-) and I were in marriage counseling.  At the start of counseling,
we took the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), which
is a widely-used personality measure.  One of the measurements which comes
out of the MMPI is called the ""masculine/feminine"" score.  To my surprise,
I came out extremely feminine (more that two standard deviations from the
mean)!  Now, I am a heterosexual male with a strong interest in outdoor
sports, and no inclination at all to act effeminate.  Why did the MMPI
label me ""strongly feminine""?  The counselor explained that, when the test
was invented shortly after World War II, ""masculine"" meant ""interested
in hunting and fishing and not interested in the fine arts"", whereas
""feminine"" meant the reverse.  Since my time in the mountains is spent in
technical rock climbing or wilderness skiing, not in hunting or fishing,
and since I like the fine arts, I'm feminine (according to the MMPI).
Maybe I should go out and buy a skirt....

So, if #2 is true, why was the paragraph preceding that so flaming (by
virtue [or vice] of its implying a calumnious accusation)?  If, as you
yourself state, a heterosexual man can display archetypally feminine
qualities, why take issue with the fact that someone else has stated the
same thing?

You will note that my self-analysis has been public only minimally in
recent months, partly because I have a group of actual people that I meet
with once a week for mutual support, and partly because net.singles did
not meet my needs (quite the opposite; there seemed to be a flame-throwing
contest going on for a while).  As I wrote above, I was trying to show
sensitivity; if you didn't take it that way, that's YOUR problem.

Pejorativeness is in the eye of the beholder.  This concept certainly helped
me to start integrating the archetypally masculine side of me into my life;
and I figured that a concept which was directly on target and helpful for me
stood a good chance of being generally true.  After all, I *am* a human being.
Basically I'm saying this:  As I reach a state of greater personal wholeness
and integration, the homosexual desires I have felt in the past recede more
and more, and the heterosexual desires get (sometimes inconveniently) stronger.
I would invite you to examine yourself honestly and see how well-integrated
you really are.  Start with these data:  You put me in a stereotype of myself
which is months out of date, and you reacted angrily to a statement intended
to show understanding and sensitivity.

And, I think, rightfully so.  You are not ""making an effort"" to understand,
you seem to be making an effort to fit other people into your worldview AGAIN.

We might want to believe, but just asserting ""I've changed"" and showing real
evidence of it are two different things (though I've come to realize your
ability to equivalence YOUR viewpoint, no matter how tainted, to ""WHAT IS!"").

Because of YOUR implication that homosexuality IS ipso facto an outgrowth of
this same thing.  Fact is, I have my doubts as to why some people choose
homosexuality; I personally think a lot of gays DO feel stigmatized about being
labelled contrary to their sex (men labelled ""feminine"", women labelled
""masculine"") and choose a gay lifestyle because of that. (Of course not all
people so labelled do this.)  But that doesn't speak for those homosexuals who
simply choose to be gay because it is what they want.  And in either case, it
is nothing to look down on as ""suboptimal"" just because you don't like it.

Well...  :-?  Since gays are the group your statements are ""pejorative"" about,
I'd say they have a right to be upset.  Of course pejorativeness is in the eye
of the beholder!  In your eyes (i.e., what for you is apparently the only
""correct"" view of the world), for sure it's not upsetting.  To not recognize
how obnoxious it is to those you are referring to is the height of
insensitivity!

Translation:  As you are more pleased with your own self-image as analyzed,
your homosexual desires recede (of course they do, you hate and despise them,
what else could be expected from a positive self-image for you:  to have
such desires would invariably CAUSE a negative self-image!).  Your cart is in
front of your horse.

Intended, indeed.  But lacking in any real sensitivity.  I'm with Dyer:  you
really haven't changed.  I was just about to mail a note of congratulations for
the ""suggestion"" note you had posted, thinking you might be seeing things a
bit more clearly than the old days with the rosary-colored glasses (oh god
that was a bad one!), but no.  It was not to be.  Not stereotyping at all.
Actually witnessing little or no real change despite the changes that YOU
may subjectively perceive.

Quit looking for reasons that people are gay, quit trying to find differences
between gay people and 'good Christians', and quit referring to gay people
as suboptimal... and you won't get flammed by gay people when you make an
ass out of yourself by your stupid statements.

Let's show some sensitivity, who has got the jackhammers?  Oh, you don't

It sure is, but if many gay people find your statements about gay people
to be offensive, perhaps it is because there is something to see.

Good for the concept, and I'm glad that you feel that you are getting
integrated.  Many gays have no problem integrating their masculine sides
into their lives... or allowing their feminine sides to be a major portion
of their lives.  Oh, some gays have problems (like, ""I'm gay, I guess I have
to be a hairdresser""), but more schools like the Harvey Milk school in New
York should help.  What would be better is if people would quit trying to
make gays out as being either intrisically different from other people
or supersinners.  You seem to have given up on the latter.

Sounds like you are doing a good job of brainwashing yourself into traditional
Christian values (but better watch that lust stuff).

(Grumble ... mutter ... damn marriage counselors ... grrr)
The MMPI is probably one of the most  commonly  misunderstood  and  misused
psychological  instruments  in  existence.  This  is unfortunate as, in the
hands of  an  expert,  it  can  be  an  invaluable  tool  in  psychological
evaluation  and  therapy (I've seen an MMPI expert perform feats that would
put any fortune teller to shame just by looking at a client's profile).  It
must  be  remembered,  however,  that it's only a tool and only one of many
tools that should be used in a thorough evaluation  protocol.  The  results
must be placed in the much greater context of the person as a whole.
Becoming an MMPI expert is non-trivial.  The one I referred to above was  a
licensed  Ph.D.  psychologist  with  literally thousands of MMPI's worth of
past experience to draw on.  Unfortunately, obtaining a copy  of  the  MMPI
and  it's  scoring  sheets and instructions _is_ relatively trivial.  It is
frequently used and abused by people who, in my opinion, have  no  business
messing  with  it  at  all.  This  includes  most  marriage counselors who,
despite what _they_ think, generally lack the training to make  proper  use
of it.
Part of the problem is that the scoring procedure for the MMPI is  straight
forward.  So  much  so, in fact, that there are computer programs that will
do it and even produce tentative analyses from the scores.  These  analyses
frequently  contain  blatant  contradictions  laid  side  by  side  and are
considered worthless by most experts.  Untrained users of the  test  seldom
do much better than the computers.
Anyway, without going into further detail, the masculine/feminine scale  is
only  one  of a number of dimensions measured by the MMPI.  Any one of them
is virtually meaningless in isolation, regardless of score.  They  must  be
evaluated  in  the total context of the other scores and of the client as a
whole person.

""The human mind unconsciously resists the truth"", ah yes, what a genial
mathematician that old Freud was.   And what a wonderful weapon he provided
to the keepers of the status quo.  ""you are upset because I said women should
go back home where they belong?  well, it is because your subconscious is
reacting to the truth I just stated"", ""you are upset because I stated that
homosexuals are badly integrated individuals?  gosh, that subconscious of
yours must be having a hard time with the truth today"".
Freud said so many unproven, outrageous libellous things in his lifetime that
he HAD to cover himself with such a weapon.   You see, anybody who would get
offended by his theories, did not because they were offensive, but because
their subconscious had a hard time with the truth.  Yep, a real genius!

	I'm not surprised at this at all. When I was in the ninth grade, I
was taking one of those dumb ""how to be a person""-type classes, and we were
given a MMPI. It turned out that I was highly feminine. I sort of expected
this, because I was one of those kids that would rather read a book than
be out playing ball. I still felt a little bad, until I found out that
EVERY OTHER GUY IN THE CLASS was classified as ""highly feminine"".

line between friendship and SOship lies.  The main purpose behind this was
to determine just how far some people would consider taking a friendship
(ie one that remains purely platonic).
Mainly I'm concerned with the physical aspects of a relationship.  That is,
just how physical can friends be before they can no longer be considered 
just friends?  I'll give an example to show what I mean.
In college this past year, I got to know a female student who hung out at the
campus radio station like I did.  She already had a boyfriend, so any sort of
SOship was understandably ruled out.  However, we carried on much like we were
SOs.  That is, we hugged quite often.  We played (for lack of a better term)
snugglebunnies on the coach.  But we never did 'The Act' as Ann Landers refers
to it.  About the most we ever did was just shy of kissing (on the lips).      
The point I would like to make about this is this:  We never did anything 
serious, and at this time I had no other SO in my life, yet my RDA of 
physical and emotional comfort was fulfilled because of my relationship
to this girl, *despite* the fact that we never, ever did anything that others
might consider sexually fulfilling.  Now I just want to know why I can't seem
to have this kind of relationship with others of the opposite sex?  Furthermore,
I suspect that a few friends of this variety would equal the gratification
that can come from an SOship.
Any comments?

  I suspect this kind of relationship is more common than you might think. 
Also, I doubt if there is any clearly-defineable dividing line. I have a friend
(although I don't get to see her as much any more because we've both gotten
quite busy with other friends and other interests) with whom I have a very
close relationship. We hug, and kiss, and some of the kisses are not the
""friendly"" kind. However, we have *never* been SO's, or even close to it (or
lovers either, for that matter).  This relationship has survived through 
several SO's on each of our parts. I think one reason that you don't hear more 
about these relationships is that they can be awkward with your current SO, so
they tend to be kept more private than a real SO relationship. People fear
disapproval, both from their SO and from others.
   Also, they can be dangerous, such as when one of the parties starts thinking 
of the other as an SO they could be setting themselves up to be hurt. I had to
work through this one several years ago, but somehow the relationship survived
the strain.
  I think what defines an SO vs. a friend is agreement between the parties
involved and has nothing to do with the actual behaviors between them. Although
less common now than during the ""free love"" era, it is not unheard of for
someone to have an SO *and* one or more other lovers. Thus, it isn't as simple
as sexual relations defining an SOship either. I'd say that if you *both* view
the relationship as an SOship, then that's what it is, but if *either* party
does not see it this way, then the *mutual* commitment which defines an
SOship is not there.

I think this would have a lot to do with the cultures of the two people
in question, as well as just what the 'physicality' (ech, anyone have a
better term?) means to each.
I've lived in Miami for the past four years.  The heavy influx of Cuban
immigrants there has definitely transformed it into a more ""Latin""
culture.  I share this culture (I am Puerto Rican.)  However, I spent
the majority of my ""formative years"" in Ohio.  Now for the point (aren't
you GLAD? ;-))
I see the Latin culture as being far more physical among (hug and kiss
greetings are normal among friends of either/both sexes).  The midwestern-
American culture is a lot more reserved.  Were I to hug a Miami friend
of mine in greeting, it would be perfectly normal behavior for our
friendship, and not at all a come-on.  Were I to do the same with an
equally close friend in Ohio, we would get, at best, strange looks.
So much for analysis of culture.  Now, if two individuals are both
particularly physical in their expressions of friendship, they may hug,
caress, hold, and so on, and not care what ANYONE else thinks (which is
nice.)

Chris,
	I hope the editing leaves in what you consider significant.
	Your comments about touching and your RDA of affection seems
to me to be symptomatic of American society.  We're phobic about
non-sexual touching (and many are phobic about touching, period).
	Particularly in industries that are machine-oriented,
we need to compensate for the lack of touch in our lives.  Touch
is laden with significance; people don't know how to handle it.
We all need it (I've heard it estimated that we need 4 hugs a day
for mere *maintenance* of mental health, let alone growth!), yet
we all want to deny it.  ""I am a rock, I am an island"", as the
song goes.
	So what do we do?  We get involved in bad relationships.  We
take all sorts of abuse.  We do things that, on the surface, are
self-destructive.  We can put up with an almighty great amount
of bad to get a little good.  
	It's so much easier to find folks who, like oneself, might
be afraid of touching.  It's often easiest to just say, ""I don't
touch, whatever the provocation."" (I've heard prostitutes say that
one aspect of their work is just holding men, because the men can
not get that nurturing in any other way.)  It's a risk to hug.
It's also very rewarding.
	Let's risk.  I'm open for hugs, and I (unlike Lucy 
in Peanuts) don't charge 5 cents.

This may sound old-fashioned, but the ""Sexual Revolution"" notwithstanding, I
think 'The Act', or the possibility thereof, separates friendship and SOship for
most people.  In the relationship you describe, the possibility of sex, if there
to begin with, was certainly extremely remote, and hence neither of you felt 
under pressure to live up (or down) to the sexual expectations of the other.
Thus freed from sexual anxiety, it sounds to me as though you were able to
attend to each other's need for affection without worrying about whether things
should ""get out of hand"" (to borrow a phrase from ""St. Elmo's Fire).
Unfortunately in most relationships, the sexual ambiguity remains present, so
there is always a mild level of tension anytime the celebrants engage in any
physical contact....
I'll certainly agree with you that the kind of relationship you describe is
extremely edifying and satisfying.  It's such a relief to be freed from the onus
of wondering whether you're living up to her sexual expectations or wondering
why she isn't (or is :-)).  Just another plug, I suppose, for being friends
first (where by friends I mean friends with no sexual expectations).

I disagree.  I think that for most people, the SO-ship begins when the
cloths start to come off or ""Private Parts"" are fondled.
Also, pls. note that I said that SO-ship begins, & not friendship ends.
I am a firm believer that to have a REAL relationship, you must be friends
AND lovers.

While I agree with you in theory, I've realized it doesn't necessarily 
always work out that way in practice  (if only because there seems to 
be an implication of an inherent passage of time).  I've experienced the
freedom you speak of after just a few hours with one person; on the other 
hand, it was missing after a few months of non-sexual friendship with another.
The difference is the open honest communication I enjoy with the first 
person compared to a situation where that didn't exist in the least.

First, I'm a little new to the net.singles group (possibly just naive) and
am really not sure what 'SO' (as in SOship) stands for.  Could someone please
clarify the term? I think its meaning through context is pretty obvious.
This article reminded me of a relationship that was very similar to one I knew
of a few years ago.  A coworker and friend of mine became very friendly with 
the woman who was the receptionist for our company (and also married).  At
first they seemed to be just pretty good friends, then she was asking him(my
friend) out, then they actually started going out occasionally.
What made this seem somewhat unusual to most watching was that this 
relationship was supposedly all above board, that is they weren't hiding
anything from anyone.  Her husband knew of and had met my friend and everyone
who ate lunch in the company cafeteria would see them eating together 
every day, alone.
Most of us who knew either or both of them didn't really condemn them, but
at the same time there was a nagging feeling in the back of our minds that 
this really wasn't okay.  I think this was mainly a result of our social
conditioning, but I still feel these two were a little confused regarding
their own desires since I know that they each were having thoughts of a
sexual nature towards each other, yet doing nothing about them.
My point here is that if you're 'snuggling' and hugging someone of the opposite
sex, yet not having any sexual contact, this isn't just a close friend (like
one of the same sex) and you're probably denying yourself of something you 
really want.","ikKdfYD531cJ",12,1985-07-08,1,1

Now, this comment irritates me a lot, since I can identify with it first
hand.  When I was still a graduate student, I had a female friend, another
graduate student, who I was very good friends with, but with whom I had no
""romantic involvement"" whatsoever.  However, about halfway through graduate
school, she got married, to someone who was also a (somewhat lesser) friend
of mine.  We continued to sometimes goto lunch together; sometimes all 3 of
us, sometimes just she & I (or some other people from her office).
However, several people at the office where she worked treated me like I was
some kind of heinous criminal.
If you read Miss Manners (which I strongly recommend), you will see that
Miss Manners also addresses this issue, and says there is nothing at all
improper about this; that only recently has it been required that married
women engage in all social activities in conjunction with their husband
as a ""demonstration of marital solidarity"".
I think the following assumption:
>I still feel these two were a little confused regarding their own desires
>since I know that they each were having thoughts of a sexual nature towards
>each other, yet doing nothing about them.
>
>My point here is that if you're 'snuggling' and hugging someone...
is the problem here.  Unless one of the two people confided in you that this
was the case, I think it is grossly unjust to question their integrity in
this manner.  If they did have such feelings, well, then they did have a
definite problem there... but it is unreasonable to just assume it was so,
since I think many people of good morals would consider it so wrong to
have such feelings as to largely discourage them from beginning.  I mean,
attractions of this sort often do have a rational element to them; and if
you could be ""turned off"" WRT someone because, say, they didn't believe in
giving aid to starving children in Africa, you could certainly as well
be ""turned off"" in this sense by the fact that they were married.  (Of course
to be logically sound in our arguments we have to establish that there exist
people who are ""turned off ... in Africa"", but I suspect such people (or
analogues) exist.)

Two friends having lunch together isn't okay?  Since when?
How do you 'know' that they were ""having thoughts of a sexual nature""?
Did they tell you?  Or are you just assuming this?

Oh, so I should have sex with anyone I hug?  Thank you very much,
but I'll pass on that one.  I hug lots of people that I wouldn't
have sex with, including other males, relatives, married women,
children...
It is quite possible to be close to someone, give them hugs, kisses,
and cuddles, and *not* have sex with them, and to be quite happy
with the situation.  You can even sleep with them and not have sex
with them.
Too many people think the way you do.  It doesn't lead to more sex,
it leads to less hugging.  :-(  I wish that more people thought the way
Chris does.  Sex isn't the be-all and end-all that the popular media
make it out to be.  Wonderful, yes, but there *are* other worthwhile
things in life.  Affection, caring, trust, these are what really count.
hugs to all,

Do most people feel that SOship has more to do with exclusivity or sex?  I
would tend to place SOship above sex.  Certainly many people have sexual
relations with more than one person at a time (not necessarily all partners
present at the same time).
Is it possible to have several SOs at the same time?  If sex defines SOship,
then this must be the case for many people.  It certainly is possible for
many other people to be significant, but I feel that the meaning of SO is
one that is 'more significant than anyone else'.
Clearly there isn't any clear cut dividing line, as has been previously
stated, so SOship must be defined by each person based on what they think
it is.  After all, SO is just a label, it's the meaning that counts.

How do you 'know' that they were having thoughts of a sexual nature?  Did you
just 'figure this out' on your own or did one or both of them actually tell
you?  Maybe you just 'naturally' assumed that they were.
>My point here is that if you're 'snuggling' and hugging someone of the opposite

First of all, why can't they be just close friends?  To me this would seem like
a good definition of close friends.
Second, by asking for this I'm not denying what I want.  I don't want sex at
the expense of physical pleasure.  Sex is 'OK' but physical friendship is
fantastic!  And please note that physical friendship does not mean sex.  
It means being able to relate to each other on a physical level as well as
a mental and spiritual level.
What I really want is physical comfort, not sex.  (does that mean I just
answered yes to Ann Landers?)

    Ok gang - Lady Godiva is back, and I just can't resist this one. To
reiterate what Snoopy said, how do you know that they were having
""thoughts of a sexual nature"" towards each other? Did their faces
suddenly break out or did they start to grow hair on their palms?

    I definitely agree. I have had (and still have) many friends who I
hug, kiss, cuddle with, give backrubs to, both male and female, married
and single. I have also slept with men when there was no sexual contact
whatsoever. It's really not that difficult. And it's quite enjoyable.

  Yep. And who are we to argue if sex happens to figure in? And who are
we to argue if it doesn't? I have some very good, very attactive, in
some cases VERY attractive male friends whom I never think about
sexually. Not only is it possible to hug, kiss, etc. people of the
opposite sex without having sex, but it is possible to do it without
even thinking about it.

There is a cartoon (I think it appeared in the New Yorker) which shows a man
and woman talking, and one of them is saying ""Do you think anyone suspects
we aren't sleeping with each other?""
I have a girlfriend, and we lead pretty independent lives.  She has some
(non-romantic) male friends whom she sees occasionally, and I have some
(non-romantic) female friends whom I see occasionally.  In a few cases, this
has involved hugging or kissing.  Sometimes I have felt a desire to take
things farther.  I don't act on such feelings--but I think they're kind of
fun!

It is just as possible that a platonic friendship becomes sexual because
it seems the only way to get the hugs and snuggles.   It seems that, for
whatever reason, your colleagues have been able to bypass that trap and
get what they wanted from the relationship.  Maybe *she* wasn't getting
the physical affection she needed in her marriage.  Just maybe her husband
understood that and trusted her to be truthful with him about the friend-
ship with your friend.  All sounds pretty healthy to me.

Mainly because most people can't do all that without turning on,
and at that point they want to finish what they've started.  Unless, of
course, both people have a powerful motive for not finishing, like the
married friends that Rion Cassidy mentioned:

No, I don't think those two were confused at all.  As a veteran of a long-
term marriage, I can tell you that relationships like that are often very
deliberate choices.  Sometimes they can provide just enough emotional 
release to make it possible to stay in a less-than-satisfying marriage.
Of course it requires a delicate balancing act, and both parties really
have to know where to draw the line (and what their spouses will accept.)

I agree that it's an oversimplification to say that sexual involvement adds
problems to an otherwise solid relationship.  If problems are there,
they have to do with the way people communicate.  And believe it or not,
there are some multitalented individuals out there who are very good at both
communicating and making love.  (Some of them are even engineers.
Take my word for it.  :-) )  Actually, problems with relationships have less 
to do with individual skills than with the combination of personalities and 
expectations.  Some just don't work very well.  (OK, I'll admit I was a soc 
major.  All you psych types can flame me for that. :-)

    First of all I agree with the first two sentences. 
    I also agree with the last two sentences. 
    Its the middle one that poses the problem.
    I've certainly had sexual relationships with some people that were
anything but fantastic. They weren't even ""OK"". But that doesn't mean
that sex in general is just ""OK"". It depends entirely on the person. Of
course just because you have a good physical friendship with a person
doesn't mean that you ought to sleep together, (I'd never get any sleep
if I did that), but I don't think that sex is going to be too good if
you can't also have a friendly physical relationship with the person.
I've known people who slept together on a regular basis but never
touched outside of the bedroom. It doesn't work too well. On the other
hand, I've felt much much closer to some people when we were sleeping
together than when we weren't. I think that it a truly fantastic
experience, better than cuddling or holding hands etc. if done with the
right person.

In retrospect I perhaps didn't express myself very clearly when I made my
initial comment above.  (Incidentally I've been kind of amused by the re-
sponses I've seen to this remark.  Hardly anyone notices the ""or the
possibility thereof"" phrase, and at least to my mind this is the most im-
portant part of what I had to say.).
I believe that a certain physical attraction plays a major role in whether
most people view someone as an SO or as ""just"" a friend.  In these times
this physical attraction frequently has a sexual expression, though not
always (thank God).  It's also the case that many people don't love everyone
they have sex with; on the other hand I think even the most sexually liberated
among us will admit that sex, in theory a purely physical sensation, can
awaken in us certain deep-seated feelings.  Among my sexually liberated
friends, for instance, I've noticed a tendency toward lots of one- and 
two-night stands, and I think the reason is that if they have sex with the
same person more than that the feelings I allude to surface, and they don't
want that.

I'll agree that SOship must be defined by each according to his or her
desires; on the other hand I don't think that the ""dividing line"" is as
relative as most people think.  Sometimes I shake my head over people like
a friend I have who insists that sex is just pleasure and has no commit-
ments and yet who always ""falls"" for everyone she has sex with.  Her cap-
acity for self-delusion on this matter has caused her a lot of grief; I
bring her up only to say that I suspect she's got lots of company....

Why is it that most people on this net seem to discuss only

So far I have only noticed one person who will dare to hug both
men and women.  Thanks Snoopy, I knew there were reasonable people
in this world.  It's true that a physical relation with someone
who you can never be sexually interested in will not lead to
SOship, but it can be rewarding, and fulfill some of those RDA's.
Are most people looking solely for a sexual relation, and so rule
out anyone who might not fit?  This would lend credence to the argument
that the two of you are denying yourselves something you really want.
I have decided for myself that I would rather have a few extra physical
relations in order to get my daily requirement of affection.  From the
physical relations, there are a couple of possibilities of sexual
relations, but somehow it doesn't seem so urgent to push it into that
realm.
I also agree that the beginning of SOship is when the two of you
decide on it.  Sex is just an act and not a consummation.  It has
no meaning in and of itself.  The interpretations that we give to
sex cause all the trouble.
I vote in favor of a hug party, but given the wide dispersal of netters,
I don't think it would work.  I have sent hugs over the net to people,
so if you need it, consider yourself hugged.  If it's not enough
then look over at the person at the terminal next to you.  If they are

By now I'm sure Rion has been told that SO = Significant Other  more  times
than  enough.  The  underlying  question  of much of the current discussion
seems to  center  on  what  _is_  a  Significant  Other.  The  most  common
definitions implicitly put forth seem to define SO as someone with whom one
is both  romanticaly  and  sexually  inolved.  I  would  like  to  offer  a
different perspective.
From  a  psychological  view  SO  is  a  technical  term  with  a  specific
definition.  It  refers  to  _anyone_  who  has  an  immediate, significant
influence  on  a  person's  life.   Examples  include   parents,   friends,
relatives,  siblings, teachers, etc., etc.  Note that the relationship need
not include any romantic or sexual aspects.  Anyone the person cares  about
_for any reason_ is an SO.
From the above perspective the question of where friendship ends and SOship
begins  is  meaningless.  A  friend  _is_  an  SO, by definition.  The real
question then  becomes  one  of  how  much  romantic/sexual  involvement  a
friendship  can  stand or whether it's possible to be friends with a sexual
partner.  All of these conditions are subcategories of SOship.

I agree that most people use the term SO to mean someone who is
'more significant than anyone else'.
Thus ""*Significant* Other"" is a misleading term.
It might help to think of SO as standing for ""Special Other"".
This reflects common usage of the term SO more accurately.

BINGO!!  Thats the exact problem that I  have  right  now.  I  have  a
friend  who  moved  in  with  me three months ago.  We have known each
other for many years and have always  been  touching.  Its  also  been
just  short  of  sex.  This  seems to be just fine for her, but I have
gotten rather attached to her and find that I do have sexual  feelings
for her.
I know that we have some kind of committment,  because  we  have  been
talking  about  moving  lately  and she tells me that she'll move just
about anywhere in the world with me.
Sometimes I feel like she would be receptive and sometimes I feel like
she wouldn't, but I know that if I tried to make a sexual relationship
out of what we have I could ruin a GREAT friendship.
So, yeah, we touch and have back and foot rub sessions and hug and  do
lots  of  things  together,  but I've gotten to the point where I want
more and right now I feel frusterated.

    Ok - this makes two. Of course I hug both men and women. All the
time. Of course socially it doesn't raise as many eyebrows when I hug my
friend Dorothy (or any of my other female friends) as when I hug one of
my male friends. I don't get any more fulfillment from hugging my male
friends because there is some possibility that I could be sexually
interested in them just because I am heterosexual. Hugging different
people is more or less fulfilling depending on how close I am to that
person. My best friend happens to be male and since I am emotionally
very close to him, I like it a lot when we hug. As far as being sexually
interested in the people that you are hugging, I've hugged some of my
friends, both men and women, who I knew were sexually interested in me,
but whom I wasn't interested in. Does this bother me? - No, although I
prefer it if they don't make a pass at me. That can make things uneasy.

Yes, I have noticed this before.  Hugging other men is not something that
I would consider ""wrong"", I'm just not ready for it yet.  Hell, I'm just
learning how to act around women, I don't need the extra worry on top of that.
When I think on it, I can't see any reason why I shouldn't hug a man as much
as I should hug a women.  After all, why does on need hugs in the first place?
Warmth?  Both men and women can give this.  Companionship?  Again, both
can provide it.  Love?  Sure, why not?  Why should love between men imply that
they are not ""right""?
Still, I'm nervous about it.  But I am getting better.

I agree.  Sex used to be the big mystery to me.  Over the years I had 
basically come to terms with most major aspects of my life (religion, politics,
philosophy, what brand of Coke I like :-)), but sex was unkown to me.
I was the kid at school whom everyone picked on.  The butt of all the jokes.
The spaz.  The geek.  The nerd.  And frankly, it didn't help my social life
a lot. Anywhere I might be threatened by abuse I avoided, and gained many
benifits and losses.  Most of those who picked on me were into sports so I 
avoided athletics like the plague, leaving me with a terrible physique.
When I worked on math, science, computers, I was in my own little world,
safe from ""the bullies"".  Thus I ended up being ""a brain"".
And girls!  Hah!  That was the worst part of all.
Between the ages of 10 and 14 (approx.) we are meant to learn how to
""socially relate"" to those of the opposite sex.  The hormones are running wild
and we act like fools (usually) the first few times we ever try to get any
where with the opposite sex.  But we are forigiven for our fumbles because it
is expected of us.  It's part of the learning process.  Within a few years,
most of those initial problems have faded and we have a reasonable set of
social graces from which to work with.   That is IF you even went out and
practiced.
But no, I was stuck away reading books, and working on computers.  (I don't 
regret this, but I know that this is what happened)
So now, when I finally try to break out of my shell, I'm given none of the
freedom we were given when we were younger (it may not have seemed like much,
but it was there, trust me.) 
I better stop with this train of thought before you start thinking of me
as a whiner.  I'm not complaining (well, just a little).  I just want others
to realize where I'm coming from and to realize that not everyone is as
socially graceful as they are.  We all have faults.

[send 1000 agrees to net.agree]
However, Sex is not always ""just an act"".  It's degree of importance is 
dependent upon how much importance we place on it.  That is, it's as
important as we make.  So for you it may be just an act (this is also
fairly close to my view) but to others it is not.  
I do not wish to force my view of sex, hugging, kissing, etc. on anyone.
I hope others will be open-minded enough to consider alternatives.

We may not be able to have a hug party per se with others on the net
(unless they happen to live close to you), but we can have a sort of long
distance hug party.  Tell you what, next time your amongst a group of friends,
give them a hug.  They're just as infectious as laughing and just as much
(if not more) fun.  And maybe they will spread, who knows?  Actually, who cares?
Don't be concerned about how it will affect the state of the world.  Don't do 
it as some ""mission for mankind"".  Just do it for yourself, and for those 
around you.

Well if my experience means anything, the time when a ""GREAT friendship""
gets ruined by a sexual relationship is when one or both of you are using
the sexual part of the relationship to imply something that is not spoken
between you.  Sort of like being sexual brings up all of our socialization
about ""finding a mate"" and the rest of that crap.  Then we start making
all sorts of assumptions and stop communicating and the friendship goes to
hell in a handbasket.
On the other hand, if you are able to talk about what is going on and if
you are able to keep in mind that becoming lovers is not always a step
forward in the relationship.  I don't think that exploring the idea of a
sexual relationship is that huge a risk.  Scary, yes, but a threat to the
friendship, no.
The scary part (for me I think it is probally a whole lot fear of feeling
like a fool) has often kept me from acting on my desire to be sexually
involved with a friend.  In this context by ""acting"" I mean initiating a
conversation on the subject.  I mean it's no easier to think of an ""opening
line"" with a friend than with a stranger.  And with a friend you probally
don't want to just walk away if it doesn't work :-)
I once spent a whole evening and the better part of the early morning
visiting with a friend talking and listening to music and reading each
other favorite quotes while finishing old bottles of wine.  She finally
blurted out ""where do you want to sleep?"".  I think it must have taken
me a good minute or two (tho' it seemed like *much* longer) to dare to reply.
I hoped that it was a proposition but it could have been an inocent
question....  you can probally imagine the rest of what was going through
my mind.  Later when we talked about it she was very worried that she had
been ""too forward"" (isn't socialization wonderful? :-)  We were both *VERY*
scared.  It didn't turn into a long term SOship, partly because we didn't
live very close together, but it's 6 years later and we are still good
friends.
On the few occasions when I've screwed up the courage to say what I was
feeling I've been ""turned down"".  And I can't say it was pleasant!  But
the friendship survived just fine, even if my ego was limping for a while.
Good luck,

	""SEX"" is the most intimate of sharing experiences,
	""HUGs"" are a less intimate    sharing experience...
You may approach sex seeking purely physical gratification, but doing so
is like wolfing down a BigMac as compared to spending hours of ecstacy
enjoying a sumptuous multi-course feast as the sensual delight it can be.
But even taking the time to invest the energy to fully enjoy an intimate
sharing experience can be simple physical gratification compared to the
truly soul fullfilling experience which CAN be shared between two humans.
When approached in the appropriate manner, a hug can give you more
satisfaction to the depths of your soul than hours of sexual intimacy.
What I'm alluding to is spiritual union.  When you get close enough to 
another person to hug them, your auras ""hug"" each other as much as your
bodies do.  The melting and merging of auras, the positive feedback of
love, life force, chi-energy, spirit, is the kind of experience which
truly meets your minimum adult daily requirements of ""love"".  You may
approach this level of sharing with almost anyone, but from my experience,
the deepest, most fulfilling of intimate sharing is typically only
possible with your ""soul mate"".  I'm referring to a sharing of the most
intense kind, of the type of energy you raise in your body through
practices such as meditation, yoga, and prayer.  Ritual can be a part of
it, but the essential ingredient is transending your raw animal passion
(or waiting until it has passed by having ""sex"" first), and focusing on
your ""love"" energy rather than your ""lust"" energy.
For anyone interested in exploring this further, I suggest checking out
your local library or bookstore, in the occult or eastern religion section,
for information on Tantra, or Tantra Yoga.

     Speaking of hug parties - last night I was up until five this
morning with some professional musician friends of mine whom I have just
recently met. A lot of hugging went on. Not just between me and the
musicians (almost all of whom were men) but among themselves too.
(Thinking back to the comments about only talking about members of the
opposite sex hugging.) The one thing that happened during the
evening/morning that really stuck with me was when one of the men who
was going to be leaving that morning pulled me aside and said that I
should spend as much time as I could with these guys while they were
here because not only would I make a lot of terrific friends but that
they really liked having me around and that they needed to be touched
and hugged and to be accepted like that. He said that it really meant a
lot to them. I saw that he was very right. He admitted that he needed
that sort of thing too. So for an entire evening/night/morning I held
hands with, hugged, and kissed some of the most wonderful caring men I
have ever met while we talked, played pool, drank, etc. and not once did
anyone make a pass at me or say a lewd word (although I was complemented
a few times), and not once did I want to make a pass at anyone. In short
it was one of the most wonderful nights of my life and one that I shall
always remember. I have no doubt that it helped me every bit as much as
it helped them.  Let's face it gang - hug parties are a very good thing.
      cheers and a great big hug --

I wonder why they can't do it without turning on?  Even more important,
why do they feel they *HAVE* to finish it off by making love?  I wonder if
it might just be that they *feel* that they must do it, not that they really
have to. I think that some people just don't realize that you *don't* have 
to go 'all the way' every time you touch another persons body.

If you're really into serious hugging, you might consider buying a hugging
suit.  Nike and Adidas manufacture some good ones.  The chief purpose is
to prevent friction burns.  The nylon suits are cheaper and more durable,

I can't agree with this at all.  I have trouble remembering how many times
I've preformed 'The Act' with women I hardly knew or hardly liked.  Sex is
just physics.  
SO-ships don't have to include 'The Act'.  What about the traditional
'virgins until the wedding night'?  Would you assume that all of these folks
aren't SO's before the consumation of their marriage?  I think most of this
discussion has been viewing SO-ship as though it were a homoginized state,
not as an evolving symbiosis.  
Where is the dividing line?  There are many.  I've always found it to be an
unspoken agreement represented by some gesture such as a look or or a smile,
a hug or a discovery by one about the other.  The question: ""Do you like Ayn
Rand?"" once catapulted me into a very long and intense relationship when I
answered ""Yes"".  A probing conversation had led up to that question, but
that was the clincher. 
From this I generalize that the dividing line is heralded by gestures
marking gradations approaching the dividing gesture.  These gestures might
superficially mean something completely different, but the @i(way) they are
preformed sets them apart.

The 'attitude' can be one of two things:  something you temporarily feel
inside (for days, weeks, months...), or something that you put on at home
before you go out--much like a suit of armor.  I've used both at different
times.  Which ever one my self image will support.  Once you have it down,
it can be modified and applied to other situations besides the persuit of
MOTAS.
The 'attitude' internally is one of self-asuredness bordering on an ego
trip, but under control.  It's a competativeness that's snarling if
provoked, but protective of all MOTAS--and especially target MOTAS.
To support this kind of competativeness, a few things are necessary.  First,
a foundation for this temporarily huge ego to rest upon.  Everybody's got
some-thing that they are really proud of, and this pride can be used to
charge up the ego.  Just put yourself into a pride-loop for a while.  Run it
as a backround job, and watch your confidence rise!  
Second, treat MOTAS--especially the target MOTAS as one of two things:
either a complete sex object or as a complete non-sex object.  One or the
other is bound to get their attention and hold it until you make your next
move.  This doesn't mean total disrespect, but a little brashness can be
effective.  The key here is that while you're treating them in one of the
above manners, it's easier to think of them symbolically.  Thinking of them
symbolically is very important, as it takes fear out of the situation for
you. 
Once you've raised the problem to a level of symbolism, it's on turf that a
programmer can handle.  Looks aren't important to play Joe Studd.

	One interesting theory from social psychology has to do with 
people ""matching"" each other.  That is, IN GENERAL, people have a
pretty good concept of where they rate in attractiveness and tend to 
be attracted to those who are on about the same ""level"".  This
is an *extremely* broad generalization, but seems to hold true in many
cases.  
        I've rarely seen an awful-looking guy with a beautiful girl
or vice versa, but one does tend to see a lot of average-looking couples
or gorgeous couples or hideous couples.  (Then again, we have Christie
Brinkley and Billy Joel! :-) )
	Perhaps ""matching"" explains only the initial attraction - naturally
one's ""matching"" in looks might not be the best predictor in ""matching""
for personality characteristics.  Or is it?  People who are attractive
are often percieved as socially adept, well-adjusted and happier (according
to social psych).  
	The theory is that because attractive people have always
been TREATED as though they're OK, they ARE OK.  Perhaps Blonds Have More
Fun because people *believe* Blonds Have More Fun and therefore *treat*
Blonds as though they Have More Fun, and therefore Blonds *DO* Have More
Fun (again, this is VERY broad - there are many miserable blonds and many
happy brunettes!)!  Does this sound like an infinite loop?
	So, if the matching theory holds up, one might meet more people 
who are ""matched"" in attractiveness, thereby increasing the chances
of winding up with someone matched in attractiveness, even though the
final factors may have nothing to do with attractiveness (directly).
>See how easy it is?  How do I personally choose my own dates, you ask?

>
>	Frank Silbermann
	Yes, you probably go on the basis of personality and character that
may have been shaped partly by going through life as an attractive or 
unattractive person!
	[I certainly feel my personal life would be a lot different if 
I was 30 pounds heavier. I suspect my personality (often confident and 
friendly) would be different if I went through life perceiving myself 
as unattractive.  For a long time I DID perceive myself as unattractive - 
that kind of perception is acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I guess I 
ACTED unattractive and hence MADE myself unattractive.  Now I feel I am 
judged on the basis of personality characteristics, many of those shaped by 
confidence developed from being perceived as attractive (well, cute).]
	Everything said here is largely hypothetical and reflects some
ideas from social psychology.   Please don't mail me telling me I'm 
completely wrong because you're gorgeous and your SO isn't!  These are
broad generalizations and suggestions!!!

Psychology Today's explaination was that people choose their partners
to be AS GOOD LOOKING AS POSSIBLE.  It is only to avoid pointless
frustration, disappointment and rejection that they settle for the
best they can get, i.e. someone whose looks are comparable.

Occasionally wealth, power, fame or good social connections will substitute
for good looks.

	OF COURSE you need a reason!  Or a few.  I never meant just go
out and suddenly like yourself - I for one most certainly know it can be a
long and difficult process.  But the final result is often a *component*
of attractiveness!!  
>I've seen several cases where a *physical* change wasn't necessary.  
	I've seen MANY!  But a physical change is only an example.  I
know that when I'm low on self-esteem, often a good workout and knowing
that I can rely on my body and my health helps.  Sometimes, but not
always.  Sometimes doing something else that I feel is unique and that 
I like about myself helps (e.g. I'll start a new knitting project!!)
But not always!  FINDING those reasons to like oneself, and then using
them  *can be* important to self-esteem maintenance.
	The point is, there are no absolutes; there is no formula 
that can be applied with success to all people!!  All I meant was that
in general, I have found that people with positive self-images and
who **in general** are happy with who they are, tend to be happier

First of all, in a romantic relationship, it's not always clear how strong
the friendship is.  Such things tend to get muddied a bit by other elements
such as sexual attraction.  If the friendship isn't strong to begin with, it
may be harder to keep it going afterwards.
Second, when I have broken up with a girlfriend I have usually felt a
conflicted combination of pain, anger, resentment, and lingering romantic
attraction to her.  The anger and resentment would tempt me to withdraw in
an attempt to ""get back"" at her; and the pain and the lingering attraction
would also tempt me to withdraw as a form of self-protection.  If you
consider that these kinds of things tend to occur for BOTH parties when a
couple breaks up, it's not so surprising that maintaining a friendship is
difficult.
The time I found it easiest to remain friends with a former girlfriend was
in a situation where we had been close friends before we became romantically
involved, and the feelings of friendship were always stronger than the
romantic feelings.  Thus maintaining the friendship was important to both of
us.  We had both decided simultaneously that we wanted to end the
relationship, so neither of us felt ""abandoned"" by the other.  In addition,
I was getting interested in someone else, so I didn't mope around and harbor
resentment as much as I might have otherwise.

   Lots of break-ups are unfriendly;  some are friendly.  For myself it depends
on the particulars of myself and the SO, and the particulars of the break-up.
(e.g. the presence of 3rd parties, and especially sex therewith.)  In any case,
break-up often lead to feelings of hurt, rejection, ""lets get back together""
(very messy), jealosy, ""please let me string myself along"" (also messy), etc.,
which are not condusive to an immediate transition to ""Let's spend a lot of time
together platonically"".  Sometimes its best to just leave it alone.

Watch TV comercials for an hour, Tim. If you still think male-types and
female-types are outdated, passe', or a moot point, then you are merely
being naive (no offense intended). Despite ""equality"" of the sexes,
types exist and even some of the most ardent feminists I know support
different types for men a women, just not the ones we have today.

You were bothered by the way a salesman tends to emphasize the advantages
of his product, while ignoring the disadvantages and weaknesses.  Similarly,
some people are good at putting on a good front, making themselves seem better
than they really are.  I believe you expressed annoyance at the success
of this (dishonest?) tactic.
I have no sympathy for the guy who just plain _lies_ about his accomplishments.
But I believe you should try to emphasize your most attractive qualities
and distract attention from your faults as much as possible.  These will
come out soon enough anyway.  But why expose them to someone before
that person has first had a chance to appreciate your good points?
To connect this to the evil-eye business -- The person afraid of the evil
eye will dwell his disatisfactions.  He is overly modest, feeling that
pride not only goeth before a fall, but actually causeth the fall.
Focusing so much attention on his faults, such a person begins to create
a self-image based on them.  This makes it doubly difficult to improve,
since any new behavior will be seen as phony and unnatural.
The Positive-Thinker, on the other hand, focuses his attention upon what is
good (or improving) about himself, not because he is completely satisfied
with what he sees, but because a positive self-image is necessary for proper
growth.
In other words, if you tell yourself that you are stupid, you will lose
confidence in yourself, and the resulting anxiety will cause you to make
stupid mistakes, thus confirming your self-image.  If you tell yourself
that you are intelligent, you will not be afraid to use your mind.
The result is that, effectively, you will conduct your life in a more
intelligent fashion.  Similarly, if you tell yourself that you're a really
sexy guy (in your own way), you will begin to behave in a manner consistent
with your self-image.  The result is that you WILL become sexier.
So, when a person you know well seems to be promoting himself in a biased
way, he is not necessarily dishonest.  He may be merely focusing on
the bright side.  And let's face it.  A person who often puts himself down
in public is likely to do the same thing to his spouse, children,
friends or employer, once he begins to strongly identify with them.
Who wants to have someone like that around?

Honesty is not the point.  A woman KNOWS she is only mortal.
If you come on like you're in love and you hardly even know her,

In her book, _The_Truth_About_What_Women_Want_in_Men_, Susan Eno explains
why some women pair up with tough, superficial, uncaring men.
She says that women really want a man who is both --
	1) tough, confident, and competitive, so he can protect her
		from the world,
and
	2) sensitive, vulnerable and caring so she can feel loved.
It is difficult to find men capable of relating to people in BOTH modes.
So, some women compromise and choose a man who is only 1), while others
settle for a man who is only 2).  But, what women really want is someone
who can go either way, depending upon what is appropriate to the situation.
I, myself, am a 2), trying to tack on some 1) characteristics.
I was discussing women a couple of weeks ago with a friend of mine.
This guy is a ""Big Man On Campus"".  He'll be president of the senior class
this fall.  He's active in student government and the fraternity system.
He complained that, while he knows hundreds of women, and dates frequently,
he still feels lonely.  He doesn't know how to switch modes from being
the jolly ""master of ceremonies"" type, so his relationships, though pleasant,
lack intimacy.  Because of his religious beliefs, casual sex is out of
the question.
I responded told him that I have the reverse problem, namely, how
do I get women to notice me in the first place?  Once I know the
woman cares for me a little, I can take it from there.
We agreed that, together, the two of us would make one hell of a guy!

Glad you asked.  I use these two terms because if I don't, a handful of
people come out of strange corners and begin uttering hostile rhetoric
because whatever word I happened to use offended them.  The above terms
connote nothing at all except a person's sex, and are based on a strange
grammatical flaw in Niklaus Wirth's original book on Pascal.
Having argued endlessly with Sophie Quigley, Beth@sphinx, and Jeannette
Zobjbeck (sp.) over words for female people, and other irritating aspects
of English syntax, I would rather not use any words at all than get into
another argument.
Disclaimer follows.
(However, I have decided Jeannette is basically a nice person.  This doesn't
absolve the former two, however, who have never yet said anything to me
that wasn't purely vindictive.  However, it seems pointless to endlessly
argue over mere words, especially when there is so little time remaining
to do so...  I hope you won't start another such argument in here; there
is enough in net.flame already.)

I suppose I gave up the distinction a long time ago. When you start
putting labels on someone close to you, you're bound to come up with
contradictions eventually. I have found that sex is another special
thing in a long list of special things you do with those who you are
close to. Like going to Art Galleries, playing raquetball, seeing a
movie, talking about ""the profound subjects"", goofing off, getting
drunk, going to a ballgame, etc.
Why is sex so special that it should change the letter and spirit of a
relationship? If you start out as ""friend"" and suddenly (after a night
of sex) become ""lover"", what has changed? Have you lost a friend and
gained a lover, or do you now have a friend with whom you share the
intimacy of sex? Do you love that person any more now that you have had
sex with them? If you meet a (fill_in_the_gender) at a bar and take
them home for a roll in the hay and then, after a few more times
together find that you both enjoy skiing and become ski-partners, have
you lost a lover and gained a friend, or have you found another area of
interest that you are exploring together?
If you really love someone in that SO sort-of-way and have never had a
sexual encounter with them are they not your SO ?? My solution has been
to merge the two with the reasonable expectation that I will have
relationships where sex is an integral part and some where it wont.
Also, not all my friends like to see movies with me (mostly they don't
like my taste, but that's another story...). Oh, also I prefer the
scenario of ""sleeping with my friends"" rather than ""being friends with
those whom I sleep with"", but I guess that's just me...

There are no absolute standards here, it depends on what culture
or subculture you are in.  For instance, in France, platonic friends
do all of the above.  And in some subcultures of Californica,
casual friends have sex, as well.
The term ""SO"" is usually used by monogamous or nearly monogamous people.
Assuming you fit that category, simply list your behaviors according to
increasing intimacy.  As you go down the list, you'll eventually reach
behaviors that you do not do with most of your friends.  When you get
to one that you rarely do with more than one person in any given week,
well that's where to draw the line.

Love?  Who said anything about Love?  One can have a friendship and a VERY
intimate relationship including sex without (at least what I see as) Love.
There is a BIG difference between friendship and relationship though.

Is it significant that Sunny wrote ""love"" and you wrote ""Love""?
What feelings do you have for friends and others you are intimately 
involved with if they are not loving feelings.  Seems to me even 
more difficult to draw a line between ""affection"" and ""love"" than
friendship and SOship (or do you think it is the same question?).
I also have difficulty using ""relationship"" as a significant
descriptor.  To be in relationship with another is to relate to them;
this definition includes a whole spectrum of behaviors.  Stewart
Emery has written that any relationship that lasts as long as 
three months cannot ""end""; it has affected your life.  It
simply changes form.  This seems descriptive of my experiences.

Neither, both, one or the other.
Actually, to me the wrong idea is where the person interprets the
backrub/holding hands/cuddling as anything more then 
a backrub/holding hands/cuddling.
Life I've said before, this doesn't mean that it can't be more then
just a backrub/holding hands/cuddling.  But unless it is mutually agreed
upon by both parties it *isn't* anything more then a
backrub/holding hands/cuddling.

The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

To me, the word ""woman"" connotes a person who is 5 - 7 years
older than me.  I DON'T know why; it just does.  Pardon me for
living.  Actually, anything 19 - 30 will do.  (19 because one
cannot get into a bar in NYS if under 19;   the 30 is negotiable).

The word ""girl"" has at least two meanings.  It can refer to any
prepubescent female.  Also, it is often used to describe any
adult female who is still young enough to be sexually attractive.
In the second context, the word ""girl"" is used to avoid the negative
connotations often associated with the word ""woman"" (one such negative
connotation is a middle-age spread--check out who shops the ""women's
sizes"" at Sears).
Feminists insist on restricting the word ""girl"" to the first meaning.
I recommend that we humor them when posting to this network,
to avoid unnecessary flames.

When meeting a woman without benefit of a third person's introduction,
you are at a disadvantage.  The woman may feel cheap if she allows
herself to be ""picked up"".  She may wonder if you are secretly a
homocidal rapist.  Having just met you, she may not be sure whether
she is even attracted to you.  If she does agree to go out with you,
will she have to submit to sexual harassment?
For these reasons, always suggest a first date that is SAFE.
Don't ask her for dinner Saturday night.  Ask her out for Monday lunch.
Or a picnic in a crowded park.  Choose a casual date that provides
NO OPPORTUNITIES for you to make unwelcome sexual advances.
If the date you propose is ""safe"", the woman will be more likely
to take a chance on you.  The ""safe"" date allows her to build
her trust in you gradually.
What's important in to take things one step at a time.

In the best of all possible worlds, it seems clear to me that the time
to stop calling females ""girls"" is the sams as the time to stop calling
males ""boys.""  But we don't live in such a world.  Many of the feminists
I know choose to use ""after high school"" as the divider.
As a practical matter, I use this cutoff for females, but not strictly
for males.  This is because it's easy to take calling an older male
a ""boy"" as a friendly reference, whereas calling an older female a ""girl""
fits so well into the existing sexist pattern that it is too likely to
go unnoticed, thereby reinforcing the pattern.

It does seem unfair that an adult male can be imprisioned
for having sex with a 17 year-old, if she is indeed a woman,
and not a girl.
One traditional viewpoint is that a girl becomes a woman
when she has sex for the first time.

I think the reason so many woman in the middle age group

First of all, nobody's seen Jackie Onassis lately, without her sunglasses.
As for Gloria Steinem, I might call her a girl, if only to annoy her.
Most of the rest are movie actresses.  Haven't you heard of special effects?
Didn't you see ""Star Wars""?  It's all make-up, like with Dustin Hoffman
in ""Tootsie"".  Even if Jane Fonda does still look good, she's nowhere near
the pinnacle of cuteness she displayed in ""Barbarella"".

Thanks, Paul.  Once upon a time, there was a heavy sexual connotation to the 
word woman, as in the phrase ""real woman"" (before the lunatic fringe got ahold 
of it.) There are still some of us around who don't do a bad job of living up 
to that, aged and feeble though we may be. :-)

Believe it or not, some of us don't wear ""women's sizes"" and some of us don't
shop at Sears.

This is the one place I have to disagree with you, Paul.  I think ""young
lady"" is one of those great equal opportunity phrases.  As someone said,
say that to a 40-year-old woman and watch her smile.  Also watch her snicker.
My 18-year-old daughter, on the other hand, would snarl at you (but what
can you expect from the younger generation? :-)  )  I am quite sure it would
offend more people than ""girl"" -- at least teenagers and many women over 55 or
so are comfortable with that one.  Really now, is there anybody out there who
likes being called a young gentleman?
I think ""lady"" is probably the most acceptable across the board today, but
the more educated, independent women (those you are most likely to 
meet) generally prefer ""woman"".  There is one pitfall, though:
when used with a possessive (my woman) or as direct address (come here, woman)
that word takes on heavy redneck connotations.  Better be very sure of the
person and the situation before you try that.  I personally find it 
intolerable in nearly all situations, but on occasion it can be delicious.
With these (or any other) words, you need to make a distinction between
public language, which should be neutral and inoffensive as possible, and
private language, which can be much freer (and more fun!)

Today's young, professional straight couples actually have a lot in common

There's not much difference there, except sexual preference!  Some

If the gays pioneered a yuppie lifestyle, perhaps AIDS is living
proof that gay's ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" attitude
eventually WILL lead to their destruction, just as a yuppie
lifestyle woven only of materialism (and NOT sexually transmitted
lethal diseases) leads to a society devoid of spiritual consciousness.
Another problem is differentiating between yuppies and preppies.
Not an important problem, mind net, but a problem nonetheless.
Sure, bermudas from Beans can be construed as prep, but do they
wreak of yuppie? Somehow prep is more of a socially accepted
term, and yuppie is definitely derogative.

Maybe I'm just a little slow today.  Would you care to rephrase
this argument in two or more sentences?  That way I can attempt to
follow what appears to be, in this form, a completely disjointed
morass of sanctimonious assertions.
On a different note, I'd be interested if someone could tell me
where the term ""yuppie"" originated (i.e. who first used it?  Time
Magazine or the like?)  The first time I remember hearing it was
on a Mark Russell comedy special a couple of years ago.

Now that you ask, I can't figure out what he's saying either.  But when
I first read the original article, I read perhaps the first two lines
of the paragraph before deciding that the rest probably wasn't worth

I find it difficult to believe the implication of this: that the vast
majority of men do not want to take any responsibility for birth control.
I take this responsibility seriously, and the few men that I've talked
to about it also do.
Perhaps the statistics also measure the sort of men that these women chose?
If they are so disappointed in men that don't express concern about birth
control, then why are they having sex with them?  Is there some sort of
correlation between the fact that these men are not interested in birth
control and the fact that these women were attracted to them?
Also, were the men not discussing birth control because they didn't care,
or because they were uncomfortable discussing it and got the impression that
the woman was too?  Communication is the responsibility of both parties.
Essentially, my experience contradict's Judy's.  I'm curious as to why.

In general I agree with Judy but there are some important nuances that have
been disreguarded.
From my experience, and I don't ask, if the woman uses no contraception
she will bring it up; then it is *both* our responsibility to deal with
precautions, even if that implies abstinence. It is a matter of
etiquette rather than insensitivity. As it is customary for men to ask
women out, it is customary for women to bring up birth control before
sex if necessary.  Most single women today use some form of birth
control, so the question is (unromantic :-) and) unnecessary.
When two adults get ""swept away"" they are equally responsible for their
actions. If there are unpleasant consequences that the partners of
Judy's friends refused to deal with, then this says something about
their character rather than the male gendre. There *are* a lot of nice
men.
It is part of the laws of nature that physically women suffer most as
a result of mistakes. Ultimately, it is to their best interest to enforce
prevention of mistakes. Do not misunderstand this statement, it is not
meant to take responsibility off the shoulders of men; but when a bad
apple comes by the woman should not sulk and cry because she can *do*
something about it.

I agree with Dave. I've asked every partner I've had (""every"" doesn't amount
to a large number here, but it's >0!) if she's using something, and they all
either were, or were about to. I asked the question when it was clear that 
we were going to need it, but in time to stop if necessary. If a man doesn't
ask this one simple question before going to bed with a woman I'd say she's
getting a lesson about his personality and outlook--but if she's prepared to
sleep with him without precautions, she's not treating herself any better.

I've also tried to think of movies where birth control was used, and ""Summer
of 42"" was the only one I could think of (and there it was introduced as ""what
every Man carries in his wallet"" and what kids are embarrassed to buy). There
are a few movies featuring unwanted pregnancy though....

I also take this responsibility seriously, but I unfortunately do not
find it difficult to believe the above implication. One of my women friends
(i.e. not an SO) told me that every man she ever slept with (I don't know
how many) simply expected her to be ""ready"". When I expressed some shock at
this state of affairs (no pun intended), she was shocked that *I* was shocked!

That surprises me.  In such situations, unless the answer was made clear to
me beforehand I've always asked the woman whether she was using any form of
birth control--and if she wasn't, I have used a condom.  I don't think it
has ever occurred to me NOT to ask--I don't want to get anyone pregnant!

OK, so we agree on one thing: it's unromantic.  However it's quite
necessary.  What happens if she forgets?  Is it really so horrible
to ask ""What about birth control?"" and get an ""All taken care of, I
use the <foo> method.""  Wouldn't you rather hear an ""Opps, I forgot,
hang on a minute"" than get a ""We have a little problem"" call a
couple months down the road?
A little consideration goes a long way.

	The issue is far too important, to my mind, to be relegated to a matter
of etiquette.  Far too much stands to be lost by people who aren't raised
with the same awareness of the ""proper"" etiquette as you have.  Indeed I
feel that etiquette is largely a function of showing conern for others, and

Where have I been - this custom is new to me. From what my female friends
tell me, when they bring up the issue of birth control it is self
preservation, not custom.
Undoubtedly many will disagree with me, but in reality, there is only one
means (not counting abstention, which begs the issue) of birth control 
available for the male - the condom. In my opinion, and thus far without
fail, in the opinion of all of the women I have gotten an answer from, the
condom is esthetically unappealing and deprives both parties of
sensitivity, not to mention the fact that when used as a last minute
option, lack of other preparation can leave both parties physically sore.
For this reason and others (such as effectiveness), I find the pill or the
diaphragm (in that order) to be better options. I am more than willing to
do my part in paying for such things (though ""etiquette"" seems to preclude
this in practice - the offer has never been accepted), but I can hardly
take the pills for the person.
Between the combination of esthetics and chemical reality, for many couples
the responsibility for birth control does fall to the female. I don't like
it either...

Some will suggest that abortion is a legitimate out. I disagree. Abortion
should not be viewed as a substitute for responsibility.  Birth control fails, 
and abortion is then legitimate to my way of thinking. If nothing else, 
abortion involves severe emotional trauma. Any normal woman stupid enough to
willingly go to bed with a man who cares so little about her health, safety, 
and feelings is making a tragic error.

Are you sure?  Since fetuses don't think, maybe the only thing they
really ""understand"" is ""swept away.""

The question is rigged.  How often do most of us engage in sex without hugs?
If Ann had included a ""sex with  hugs"" category, she'd have gotten an

My wife and I talked about this one  for a while. Our conclusion is that Ann
Landers is off her rocker in at least 2 ways.
(a) My wife argues against the  72%  conclusion,  saying that sex is better,
but  were  I to develop permanent impotence for whatever reason,  she  would
have little problem giving it up. I  argue  against the 72% conclusion, too.
Count 2 votes for option [1] above.
(2) AL's sampling technique is  completely  bogus. The only people who would
respond  to such a survey are those who have a *really strong  feeling*  one
way or the other. That survey is  unlike this network, where responding to a
survey requires nothing more than the same medium used to see the  question,
that is, a terminal. No; to respond to AL, you have to get a postcard, write
words  on  it, find a stamp (now let's be honest, netters: how many  of  you
know where there's a 20c stamp in  your  house right now? :-), get to a post
office, and mail it.
That means that only those who are really motivated to one side or the other
of the question will answer. Now, of those for whom the response would  have
been ""sex over hugs""  (i.e.,  the  28%  conclusion),  how  many  would be so
motivated as to write AL a postcard? *My* wife certainly wasn't. (Maybe  you
or your wife was, of course...) Considering also the number of women whom AL
quoted with complaints such as being raped 5 times a week by their husbands,
it seems to me that those  for  whom  the  response  is  ""hugs over sex"" are
considerably more motivated to their side of the question than are those  of
the ""sex over hugs"" persuasion.
It was a pretty stupid way to  conduct a  survey. But then she never claimed
it was scientific, did she?

say that ideally they wanted both.
I'm afraid the Landers survey indicates that far too many American women
feel that they have to choose:  i.e. that their lovers don't make them
feel secure/loved, merely erotically desired.
This may well tie into the (statistically proved) fact that people with
pets tend to live longer.  People need affection, and the pets apparently
supply a more significant source of that than husbands do.  (Judging from
the fact that single women live longer than married women, while married
men live longer than single men--and all sorts live longer if they have
pets.)

While I can survive without sex (notice I said
""survive"") I find life to be very depressing without being  
hugged more or less on a daily basis.  
The hugs can be deviod of sexual content but must be from
someone who needs them as much as I do to be really
satisfying.
I think it was Maslow who said that one needs four hugs a
day for survival, eight a day for maintenance and twelve a
day for growth.

If I could choose only one, I'd choose hugs over sex, too.  Sex without
hugs is almost unthinkable!  But if I was assured of having the hugs
either way, I think I'd give the same answer as almost any red-blooded...
human!
All in all, reading Ann Landers is a poor substitute for hugs *or* sex.

i like both a lot (too much, sometimes).  being gay, i have a peculiar
vantage point because sex is always so readily available and (until 
recently, with the AIDS crisis) carried few long-term risks (read:
pregnancy).
i had been somewhat promiscuous for a while and grew very tired of
sex itself, though it took me a lot longer to realize why i kept going
back -- it was the loneliness -- the need to feel attractive, to feel
loved.  it took me a while to figure out after that that i wasn't
getting what i thought i was getting from these one-night stands.
i thought a lot about just asking someone home to sleep with me --
read:  let's curl up together, cuddle a bit, and go to sleep -- because
i missed having someone next to me at night after breaking up with my
last boyfriend.  I really would have preferred a hug to the sex i was
getting at the time.
there were a few times, however, when sex was exactly what i wanted.
it took me more time than anything else to acknowledge that it was
OK to have a sex drive (and an annoyingly high one at that), and that
it was OK to indulge it once in a while as long as i was careful not
to get (or spread) any disease and didn't hurt anyone.
i find that my sex drive gets higher when i'm depressed, and i think
now that has to do with wanting the reassurance of someone holding me
close for a while.  
i've found, though, that i do prefer a steady boyfriend and a more
monogamous relationship (i'm just getting started getting involved
with someone, so i am seeing other people, which feels strangely
foreign to me because for so long i have been a total monogamist (in
belief when not in practice -- i gave myself hell for anyone i slept
with that i wasn't in love with), but i learned what can happen to
a potential relationship if it gets too deep too fast).  i want things
to go slowly, and i don't want any real pressure yet.
also i think i can understand why more women would prefer a hug to sex.
many men are out there to get *their* rocks off, and really don't care
much about the other person, be they male or female.  I have had some
wonderful sex partners (mostly the ones where a mutual concern for the
other person's pleasure was apparent, but not such a dominating factor
that they forgot to have fun too), and i have also had a few people
i wouldn't trust to screw in a lightbulb after extricating myself
from their presence.  While i am no 'fem' (i just consider myself a
normal, average person who happens to be gay) i am constantly annoyed
in particular by the 'butch' attitude -- 'I don't do that', or ""you
can do anything you like.  just don't expect me to reciprocate."" (my
first boyfriend told me that.  i stayed with him for a long time
because we were both young (high school), each others' first, and
because i was too stupid to see he was being selfish and inconsiderate).
i guess what i'm saying is what i said in the first paragraph.  it's
nice to have both, but i can really understand the 'hug > bug' view-
point, seeing as how i held it for a while.  it seems that you have
to know which you are looking for at the time (or if you are looking
for both).  once you know that, you can go from there and will
probably be more satisfied with whoever you find.

A big difference between men and women is that men are naturally

the survival of his genes by having as many partners as possible.
Promiscuity in women, on the other hand, with their
few eggs, has no advantage: The limiting factor is gestation 
time, not number of partners. ""Male promiscuity"" is therefore selected
for while ""Female Promiscuity"" is not.
Now, humankind, with its overly developed brain, has worked this
fundamental tension into an amazing web of customs, beliefs,
rationalizations, guilts  and neuroses.  Females, for example,

Did you hear about the prostitute in San Francisco who had a bisexual

If you believed in promiscuity, perhaps you'd better rethink it.

If our society had evolved in such a way that women were not financially

I like thinking about such things. The conclusion one must reach from your 
reasoning is that the majority of males must be ABSTINENT (since some males
should be promiscuous, females shouldn't be, and, you know, the NATURAL way
it takes one of each sex) ... -)

That's awfully stupid.  If it were that vital for a male to have many
partners, it would be equally important for females to help them out in
this regard.  If said sexual promiscuity were vital for the survival
of our species, that is.  If it's a matter of intra-species competition,
then the argument reduces to ""promiscuous men will tend to have more
children, who will then grow up to be more promiscuous--if they're male.""
And even Lamarck would have barfed at that one.
What Mr. Filipski's pseudo-evolutionary claptrap wants to hide is the
fact that any differences in promiscuity derive from enforced inequality
of sexual privilege, only possible in a species mentally capable of
knowing and caring who their kids are, and thus of maintaining cultural
traditions of sexual coercion and restriction.  Sure, the spread-the-
genes argument holds for many polygamous mammals, but only because a
dominant male maintains an exclusive harem of females and tries to
prevent the less powerful males from spreading their genes at all.
Humans could have a biological predisposition toward promiscuity (some
species mate for life and do OK, so it's moot), but there's no rational
evolutionary argument for males-only.  The notion that men somehow ""want
it"", ""need it"" or ""do it"" more than women is merely an excuse for the
basest expressions of misogyny, and a miserable one at that.

I suspect most theories on the origin of marriage are based on impure
speculation and not much more.  Consider matrilineal and matrilocal
societies: in these, who the father of a child is , is of no importance.
In many of these societies, women have a lot of power, are not considered 
the property of men, and are the people who inherit land.  Two examples
of such societies are the Iroquois nations and the Hopi.
In this discussion of sex and society, most of the views presented 
seem to be based on fantasies rather than research in the relevant
sciences.  If there is anyone on the net who has researched the 
evolution of sexual behavior, please speak up.  In the meantime,
Margaret Mead's _Male and Female_ might be a relevant read.

I think we may have a problem here. Assume a population of 20
with 10 males and 10 females. Now for the males to be promiscuous
they need to have at least 2 partners. Now how can they achieve this
without the females becoming promiscuous?
The answer is clear. The males are engaging in homosexual activities.
This raises a new question. How does two males having sex maximize
survival of genes?
The answer is clear. The women are revolted by the homosexuals
and mate only with the non promiscuous males. Therefore through
time we see that monogamy was selected. So why does the original
article try to plead a case for promiscuity.
The answer is clear. The author is homosexual.

I suspect that mankind is naturally monogamous, though also promiscuous.
It is one thing to have many lovers, and another to take many wives.
Certainly married love seems to be more popular than promiscuity,
whatever women's magazine surveys may say.
On the other hand, some fathers (and mothers) run extraordinarily
successful campaigns to convince their sons to be unfaithful to their
wives.  It seems to be a tradition in some families.

Hmm...I'm not normally one to conspire with religion, but I'm female, so
I guess that I did.  *grin*.  
Now, let's look at it this way:  All the men in the world go out and are
as promiscuous as possible for a month.  Now, almost all women are preg-
nant, at least, the ones who possibly could be.  I guess the men are now
out of luck, since the purpose of sex is procreation, and all of the
available women are now pregnant, right?
Another way to look at it is:  a woman should sleep with as many men as
possible, since some of them might not be fertile (perish the thought!)
and, after all, the woman wants the best chance possible to get pregnant.
I realize these are both silly, but so is the conspiracy theory, etc.
I don't really care whether men are promiscuous or not, nor whether
other women are.  The only person I'm concerned with is myself, and I do
what I want to do.  I would certainly like to *know* that someone I'm
seeing is sleeping with other people (partly because I'm endlessly
curious, partly to be aware of any possible physical/emotional problems
that could result from this), but I don't *insist* that
he tells me.
Also, I do not feel responsible to someone I'm seeing for who or how many I have slept with, although I see
no reason for that information not to be given.  It's just
that *I* am the one with the rights here...it's my body, I can do what
I want.  (No matter what my religious cohorts (*snicker*) tell
me.)

Walt Kurszewski, 
In answer to the question ""Why all the interest in baby feeders?"" your
mother may have put her finger on it :-( when she called them ""baby
feeders.""  I don't know if I believe the paradigm whole-heartedly but
there are those who feel that almost all of unexplainable human nature
deals with the instinct to get ones genes into the next generation.
The build that we consider most sexy is pretty much the build most
capable of giving birth to and raising healthy children.  Our
forebearers who liked large breasts, mated with women who had large
breasts, and added lots of more people to the population with an
acquired (by genetics or environmental imitation of parents)
taste for large breasts.  Those who liked small breasts mated and had
less nourished children, fewer children, and passed on the interest in
sex with small-breasted women to fewer in the next generation.  Even
Twiggy has her fans, but not as many as Raquel Welch does.  Those
forebearers who had a taste for oak trees didn't pass any genes to the
next generation.
Now this explanation probably should be taken with a grain of salt.  I
don't know if there is a specific gene that makes males interested in
large breasts.  Also some thinner women are also considered attractive.
Or maybe that is something else that is automatic.  In situations when
societies are over-populated, the interest shifts to women who are less
capable of bearing or even to men.  I have heard that rats when placed
in stressful, crowded environments seem to have a much larger
proportion of homosexuals.

Maybe men who are fascinated by large breasts are jealous?
Actually, I think it has to do with genetics and the built-in 
urge to merge.  You tend to notice sex-linked traits and respond.
Development of such secondary sexual characteristics implies something
about sexual maturity and suitabilty as a potential mate.  That's
why some women find beards so attractive, too.  Of course, this
is mere speculation.  But I do have a beard (and small breasts).
I don't find large breasts especially alluring, except in a bucket
of fried chicken.  I'm a leg man, myself.  (Yup, I'll go for the
drumstick, even with big breasts.)  I actually prefer women with
smaller endowments -- they aren't as self-conscious about their
bodies (or so it seems), and they can give much nicer hugs.
Ever try to give a really nice hug to someone while holding a
couple of footballs in between?  It isn't very comforting or exciting,
unless of course you have a thing for football players or pigskin.
Now before any of you women send me your breasts in the mail with
notes like ""Are these too big for you?"" let me just point out that
I have nothing against large breasts -- at least not at the moment.
Given the opportunity, I'd put me against them.  Or against small ones.
In pairs usually, but I'd settle for an odd number greater than 7.
But I'll only do that if they're attached to a generally personable
lady with nice legs, pretty eyes, and the other standard features
required for a test drive, two per, plus or minus 1.  So, if you can
include that when you send me mail, go to it.
Next question?

Cultural conditioning.  The object of attraction can be ANYTHING - 
remember when legs were the object of attraction?  At one time
ANKLES were the big thing.  In Japan, it was (is?) the back of a woman's 
neck, and to make herself really beautiful a woman blackened her teeth.
The question might expanded to three parts: A) Do both men and women 
fixate on a particular part of the body as being the sign of sexual 
(or aesthetic) attractiveness? B) What body parts have been in vogue
in various cultures and times?   C)  What are the causes of this fixation
on one or two parts of the body?
I'm an elbow man myself.. :-)

I might agree with your explanation if it wasn't for the fact that the size
of breasts of non-lactating women is actually uncorrelated to their potential
for feeding babies.  There are women with large breasts who have very little
milk and women with minuscule breasts who can feed triplets and still give milk
away to other babies.

The problem with this is that actual size of the breast has little to do
with ability to nourish children, at least according to La Leche League, a
non-profit organization devoted to encouraging breast feeding of infants.

Just because most males in the U.S.A. now like large breasts doesn't 
mean that a significant number of men always have liked large breasts on women.
Large breasts seem to be characteristic of American women.  This may be 
due to the environment, e.g, trace elements in the water, diet, and
lifestyle.

Ahem.  While this was obviously a ""joke"" posting (kiwi fruit indeed!),
it brought to mind a question I have had for a long time.
Since the pleasure a woman experiences during ""conventional"" sex is
directly related to clitoral stimulation, it seems to me that length
is not the important size factor in the male anatomy.  I would think
that circumference would be the determining measurement.  Thoughts?
All men are not created equal.

It has yet to be proved that small breasts are less capable of
nourishing a child.  Certainly, large ones are more easily accessible,
but that is only a trivial amount of convenience.  I don't believe
that the equipment necessary for producing milk needs a C cup or better
to all fit.  And regardless of the apparent societal bias, more is not
always better.  A baby can only drink so much.  
Can someone here cite references that say that large breasts are more
nourishing for a child?
Also, large breasts can be something of a liability, since they tend
to bounce around uncomfortably.  This is intensified during pregnancy,
and while nursing, because they get somewhat larger and heavier (which
may actually be an argument that large ones are necessary...*grin*) at
that time.  I would say that having such things in the way all the time
is not a survival trait.","qIlpFFSuVWYJ",5,1984-12-16,7,1

Sometimes this news group takes itself too seriously. The point seems
to be to inject something funny into the otherwise too serious articles.
Besides, everyone was invited to discuss his/her favorite sexual body
part.
personally, I'm a walk man. I can tell more from how she walks than
anything else. But every so often I get the urge to dive in head first

You can't make that analogy, anyway.  Men can see the size of
breasts BEFORE they get together with a woman, but women can't see

Why are people of both sexes attracted to large structures?  Why the
fascination with the Spruce Goose, the Taj Mahal, the Washington
Monument, Ahmad Jamal, etc.?
Because they stick out, of course!  They are attention-grabbers!  They
behave differently during motion (slowly-damped second order linear
differential equation) than any other part of the anatomy.  I'm sure
that well-endowed women playing volleyball get nearly as much attention
from women as they do from men, although the physiological response is
different.  The women are probably thinking, ""That poor girl, her tits

	I think that perhaps the women you know are less willing
to *talk* about what they want from a man (including the size of his
penis, etc.).  Unfortunately, our society conditioned women to look
upon sex as undesirable, a necessary evil, and that they should
not like it.  So, if they aren't supposed to like it, then they
aren't going to discuss what they *do* like.
	Fortunately, things are different today.  However, that
centuries-old attitude of sex being evil and nasty has left some
bad after-tastes (like Tab); this inability to communication 
likes and dislikes about sex is one of them.
	BTW, I hope the ""That's Baloney!!"" was meant as a pun.. :-)

	It's just like SAT scores; the size of the ""bulge"" (basket,

I believe the statement ""pleasure...directly related to clitoral stimulation""
to be extremely shortsighted.  The pleasure I experience during ""conventional""
(is there another type?) sex is not directly related to friction, fit, or
orgasm and I strongly suspect the a woman's response is similarly unlimited.
I could also mention the infamous G spot but defining pleasure as stimulation
of body parts is too limiting for me.

wonder at the modern engineering which allows *her* to jog without
screaming.  *Most* people are of ``average'' appearance in some way,
that is why average is.  It is unfortunate for those who can not find
the beauty in each and every thing.  (cliche'? pardon.).  Tunnelvision
directed at one aspect of a man/woman(either order) *is* running people
into a wall without their realizing it.  Somebody completely wonderful
could walk right by *you*, and because there breasts/muscles/shirts/pants

Again, I'd say, along with Maria Moldau (?spelling?) that
""it's not the meat, it's the motion"" -- what ya got ain't nearly as
important as knowing what to do with it!
But all this aside, I think the thing which is *most* important for pleasure
in sex is WHO your partner is -- all the equipment and technique in the
world falls a poor second behind someone you love who cares for you and
wants to give you pleasure.

I go for the direct (i.e., blunt) approach.  I have wrangeled over this 
issue several times with my mother (my dad didn't care).  Why should the 
government (or your parents) interfere in anyone's private relationships.  
I have argued that children may need the legal protection of marriage, but 
that otherwise it is an anachronism.  Ask if they would rather have the 
possibility you getting divorced relatively soon rather than just splitting 
up.  Are they willing to foot the bill?  Just thinking about making lawyers 
rich is enough to turn almost anyone's stomach!  Besides, since they have 
little effective control, most parents eventually relent, unless the potential
spouse is of the wrong sex, religion or color, in which case they have been 
known to disown.
I have found that sleeping arrangements during visits home are a MUCH more
contentious issue.  I finally convinced my mother just this Thanksgiving.
We were talking about one of her best friends of many years standing, whose
husband died while in public service.  As a result, the government gives her
a generous pension, on the condition that she does not remarry.  So I asked
my mom if she was going to ask her friend and her friend's current SO to
sleep in separate rooms when they come to visit.  She finally saw the light.
But not until after the usual midnight visits (""hey, don't moan so loud, 
you'll wake the rents""), and the occasional boycotts (""well we sleep together
at home, why should we come if you don't respect our relationship"").  It 
appears that the basic issue is one of adulthood, and their acceptance of it.

Two separate issues here, and they need to be dealt with in separate but
coordinated ways. If that makes no sense, excuse me, but it's been a long
day...
>	1.  Introducing their current SO to the parentals, 
Sometimes this simply never works out. Parental units sometimes have severe
blind spots, such as believing that their 'little baby' is still little,
still virginal, still under their control, or still unable to make their
own decisions. Part of this seems to be the problem that when a parental
unit admits to their kid growing up, they have to admit to themselves that
they are getting older. How many of you have mothers that still pretend to
be 29? or 39? (I was retroactively adopted a number of years ago--
fortunately in jest...). The apron strings are very hard for some people to
let go of, and sometimes it is even harder still to get the parents to
recognize that the apron has been let go of.
Well, onward and sideways. If you are lucky, you can sit down with your
parental unit and say ~parental unit, I'm in love and I'm moving to
California to be near him~ and have the parental unit say ~God speed,
dearest child, our love goest with you!~ Fat chance. The normal response I
seem to get is ~Again? Well, one of these times you'll HAVE to get it
right....~ The most normal reaction I've heard from friends seems to be
somewhere between a screech and a gurgling howl. 
Well, if you are in the unenviable spot of being the one meeting the
parental unit(s), what do you do? First, and most important, listen to your
SO. Rule one is to learn as much about your passlq-in-laws to minimize the
chance of a major faux paux. All it takes is one, and you're dead for life.
Smile a lot, agree a lot, and be as painfully pleasant as possible. Reality
can wait until after they get used to you. Remember that they are most
likely going to consider you a whore or a rapist REGARDLESS of what you say
or do. Having a congressional medal of honor or the nobel peace prize
helps, but not much. 
There are occasions when you meet a set of parents that are open, honest,
and a real joy to be with. If so, open up and enjoy. I was lucky enough to
have that with my ex-wife's family. Everyone should be so lucky. Few are. 
Probably the key is to remember that the fate of the free world rests upon
your interview with 'THE PARENTS.' Or at least pretend it does. If the
parents are important enough to even attempt to get on your side, you need
to go out of your way to win them over. You probably will with time, but
the good first impression is critical to making this an easier thing to do.
>	2.  Being introduced to the SO's parentals.
The critical person in this is the SO. He/she needs to do as much as
possible to pre-approve you to their parents. It might (probably won't)
work, but lots of nice, wonderful comments help (leave the sex life out of
this). Letters of reference, notarized, help. Bribes don't, neither does
yelling. Quiet logic (~No, I CAN'T find someone in my own state to live
with~) sinks in eventually, usually. Keep your SO informed-- there is
nothing worse than walking into a replay of the Nuremburg trials. Help your
SO find areas of common interest (if any-- exclusive of your SO, of course)
to talk about to prove you are human. Warn them of specific quirks (Dad
believes that Nixon was a crook, Mom that he was hung out to dry-- no
Watergate jokes!) and problem areas to avoid. Be supportive, you'll both
need it.
>Now the light conversation starts, and the inevitable

>your future plans'.  ohboy.....
>
>Now, by this time you and your SO have decided that you aren't quite
>ready for happy wedlock-hood, but that won't deter you from sharing

Many parents aren't as worried about this as they used to. I've found that
discussing the current sad state of the world, divorce statistics, high
cost of divorce lawyers, and the hassles involved in breakups to be light
and diverting reparte in getting to this very subject. I've also been
tossed out of many homes, so it doesn't always work (not that I'm
constantly trying to move in with people-- I do this for friends, too, on
a consulting basis... :->)
>do you just send a
>postcard with your new address after you have moved in (not too
>practical if the move is 2000 miles away)
Sometimes the only possibility. If the parents are dogmatic and simply
won't listen, sometimes it is better to simply not subject your SO to them
until you've proven the relationship a while. If ever. I've seen a couple
of very stable long term relationships blown up by parents-- as important
as your relationship to your parents is (and it IS a very important
relationship, whether you admit it or not, just ask maslow) there are
circumstances where getting the acceptance of your parents is more trouble
than it is worth. sigh.

predict my parents reaction with out much difficulty.
First off, a little background:
For a year, I lived with a girl, on a purely non-sexual basis.  this was
understood from the start, and we both repsected each other's privacy.
We slept in separate rooms, but had no problem with discussions on
policy within the apartment, etc, and occasionally had dinner together.
Now, my parents, while not overly thrilled with the idea (""How do WE
know nothing is going on?""), accepted it without much problem.  the only
difference I really noticed was that, as opposed to other years and
other roommates, they continually asked ""How are things going with you
two?""  The answer was always the same, things were fine.  She got
married at the end of that year, and moved out.
Now, while my parents claim to be rather ""old-fashioned"", I get the
feeling that they actually have pretty liberal feelings toward this.  I
think that if I informed them that I had intentions of having a girl
move in with me (*I* would NEVER give up my apartment :-), they would
show ""parental concern"" about the amount of work I get done, and such
things as potential children (is that coining a phrase?), but would
eventually see that there was no great harm (if there was great harm,
they would inform me).  I don't think that they would ""disown"" me for
any real reason, regardless of who the girl was.  Now, concerning my
brothers and sisters, this attitude would change.  I know for a fact
that they would not be at all happy with the prospect of my sister
(older that I am) moving in with a guy, but that is they way they have
always worked.  Each child in my family was treated differently: not in

realized that we were each different.
I don't think that I could make a very educated comment on meeting
parents, seeing as it has only happened once in my life, and was not an

living together *long* after a sexual relationship has been established.
I agree that platonic co-habitation could be rewarding, and lead to
a long lasting friendship on which to base other things, but I don't
think this case comes up very often between people and their SOs.
	You seem to believe that the purpose of co-habitation is to make
sex more convenient. My experience has been that the reason for living
together is a deeper commitment to the relationship emotionally, though
not yet a lifetime commitment. It has the effect of *reducing* the importance
of sex, by increasing everyday non-sexual contact, and allowing the people
to see more aspects of each other's lives other than the dating/love/sex
portions which dominate early in a relationship. I cannot believe that anyone
would go to the trouble of adjusting their home life to a MOTOS simply for
""ease of access"" in a physical relationship. Finding the time and place
for sex is not such a problem, if sex is all you are looking for.
	The important thing about living together is *NOT* sexual contact,
but the commitment to share more of your life with your SO. This does not
require sex, but it certainly does not mean you should stop an existing
sexual relationship. Sex and living together are independent issues, and
are far too often associated with each other without regard to the
underlying feelings which generate them.

Admittedly I haven't personal experience to back this up, but have you
considered *residing* together, as distinct from the usual sense of
""living together""?  It occurs to me that if you and your SO could
successfully deal with the stresses of sharing a residence, for an
extended period, *without* using sex to paper over disagreements, then
your friendship would be so solid that you would greatly increase your
chances of a successful marriage, should you decide to exercise that option.
Another way to look at it is: one thing at a time.  Work out the balances
of plain vanilla daily life first; when they are running reasonably
swimmingly, *then* start working on the adjustments of sex.  Don't try
to do everything at once.
The obvious difficulties in this arise from this not being the best of all
possible worlds: a) the temptation to go ahead with sex would be there, and
would probably be very strong; b) even if you didn't give in to that
temptation, you'd have a tough time convincing outsiders of your celibacy
(particularly parents, I suppose).  But the idea still seems to me to have
some wisdom in it.  Perhaps you could try it, and let the net know how it
works out?

Jeff, you seem to have this idea that sex throws sand in the works.
When sex is not a problem (and in this case, it definitely isn't :-)

don't fix it....

Of course in the ideal world we are all friends before we become
intimate.  In practice, as someone (perhaps on the net) has said ""First
you find out if the hardware is compatible, *then* you worry about the
software...""
Realistically, couples who cohabit for more than purely economic
reasons are more than likely to have slept together, probably for some
time.  Perhaps someone with more self-discipline than I could deal with
the loss of sexual contact while negotiating ""the stresses of living
together."" In my case, it would have induced enough additional stress
to have guaranteed a break-up.
From my own experience, sex is hardly used to ""paper over"" disagreements.
The influence is usually in the other direction.  One tries to resolve
(in some sense) disagreements before going into the bedroom so that they
don't follow you in.  Sex as a tool of placation is a definite bummer
for everyone involved.
Too, the stresses of living together don't ever go away (sorry to pop
your balloon.)  No matter how long-term the relationship, there are
always the proverbial hairs in the sink or toothpaste squeezed from the
wrong end of the tube and a million other things that make you
momentarily wish you were living with *anyone* but your partner.  You
learn to adapt, but most of all you learn to care.  The world won't end
if you move away from the way you've always done things just a bit to
leave some space for someone you love.
Finally, living together ain't a whole lot different than being
married.  It hurts just as much when it dissolves (I speak from
experience) even when relatively ""amicable.""  The major difference is
that when you've only been cohabiting the lawyers and the courts don't
have to get involved.  When you go through a divorce, the lawyers and
the courts are the least of your problems.
Advice?  Hardly any.  Living together isn't the romantic ideal folks
cook it up to be, but then neither is marriage.  (Sound of more
balloons popping?) You make your relationships the best way you know
how, which never seems as good as it could be.  Me?  I wouldn't trade
it for anything

I suppose I should have restricted part b) to parents.  I agree that other
outsiders ought not to try to control what you do in your home.  (Note that
I said ""control""; I didn't say suggestions were entirely out of order....)

Actually, the general impression I get of this society is that people go
around hoping that they *will* [1/2 :-)].

I'm not so sure I agree with your first sentence.  From my minimal (but
nonzero) experience (the net registers shock), I have come to the conclusion
that chastity is really a good thing.  If your experience doesn't teach that,
O.K.; things like this really have to be either discovered or accepted on
faith, and despite all my net.religion postings, I'm really a sufficiently
obstinate sort that I usually have to learn things by discovery....
This doesn't say chastity is an *easy* thing, and that I sometimes don't get
envious of those who allow themselves easier access to sex; but that does not
mean that contemning those who are thus active is part of my credo.
> When you stop thinking of sex as something to be avoided, and
> something that is inherently evil, then sex isn't the massive
> problem you have made it to be...
Sex, in and of itself, is neither ""to be avoided"" nor ""inherently evil"";
after God created man and woman with physical bodies and sexual desire, He
saw that His creation was ""very good"".  Sex out of the context of commitment,
however, is another question.  Clearly you and your SO have some degree of
commitment; this gray area is one I cannot address from experience; but I do
still question whether sex outside a *lifetime* commitment is a good thing.
> Really Jeff, for someone who holds no respect for the social
> sciences, you try awfully hard to be a sociologist/psychologist.
Moi?  Disrespect the social sciences?  On what do you base this?
As to my being an amateur psychologist, I doubt that many people have
studied their most intimately available psychological subject (themselves)
nearly so much as I have studied myself (a mildly abnormal subject and not
fond of that, so I've been getting repairs made).  I haven't a lot of
training, but I have a fair amount of experience.

I suspect that a lot of parents have the belief that you mentioned in the
first sentence I quoted; it does sound as though Laurie's do.  I myself
entirely agree with your second sentence above, that the commitment is the
keystone [hence the parents' summoning of the Keystone Kops :-)], not the sex.

We HAVE been doing that, wonderfully enforced by distance and the fact
thgat sex is exceptionally unsatisfying when carried out over a pair of
computer terminals or a telephone. We don't like that option now, why would
we like that option when we are actually in the same room? During my recent
visit to my SO we didn't bother with that celibacy claptrap and got along
rather splendidly, so why ruin a good thing? If I wanted celibacy in my
relationship I'd marry a priest or something...

I just got OUT of that option (final 11/18, yippee, sigh). I'm in no hurry
to tie myself down again, if ever, until I'm sure I'm going to want to stay
tied down until I die (or beyond).

Jeff, sex simply isn't that BIG of a problem. In fact, I'd be willing to
wager that most people wouldn't consider it a problem at all (It's a
feature, not a bug!). You ought to try it sometime. Until you do, please
don't give illconceived advice based upon your own naive fears. People have
been fooling around for hundreds of years, at least, and the world hasn't
gone off it's axis yet.
>The obvious difficulties in this arise from this not being the best of all

The word 'understatement' comes to mind. As a matter of fact, we are both
so weak in our vows that we've given into the temptation. Repeatedly.
I don't see any problem with that, as long as we don't disturb the
neighbors or do terrible things to their dog with a fork or something.
b) even if you didn't give in to that

No, I could convince people of our celibacy, it's our sanity they would
wonder about...
But the idea still seems to me to have

you've been working on the celibacy thing a lot longer than we have, and
have been reporting at great length about it. Tell you what-- we'll try it
our way, and if it works out maybe you might be interested in joining the
human race with us sometime, too...

	Our wise and (very) christian friend Jeff Sargent introduces the
concept of co-habitating with your SO, but refraining from any sexual
activity (for a while). This is supposed to allow you to work out the bugs of
sharing living quarters, then you can engage in the ""more complicated"" job
of sexual fulfillment... 
Say what?  Come ON, guys and gals! Everybody KNOWS that healthy, ravenous sex
will actually help a great deal in bringing two loving people closer together.
If you have enough problems with sex (as with Mr Sargent) that it
complicates your life instead of making it more enjoyable, then you need HELP.
And just sharing quarters in abstinence will only postpone the showdown. You
should be able to have a happy, healthy and satisfying sex life even if you
aren't living with your SO. If you don't have that BEFORE moving in together,
don't even THINK it could somehow work out. See your local sex therapist. And
no Jeff, prayer doesn't help.

One reason it might be difficult to maintain such a close relationship 
with former SO's is that current SO's can be jealous of this other 
relationship.  There are alot of insecure people out there, and it can 
be difficult to believe that there isn't something going on.
Another reason (and to me the more important one) is that there is usually 
alot of pain involved when a relationship breaks up (or changes state, at
least).  It usually takes time for the pain to diminish.  Thoughts of things 
that could have been keep fliting through your brain.  It will often depend 
on the people involved.  
In all of the important relationships I've been in, we'd decided that our
friendship was very important to us both, and that we'd want to continue,
even if we broke up.  
In two cases we ended up seeing little of each other for about 6 months.
It can be hard to stop thinking of someone in sexual and ""possesive"" terms 
(haven't you ever felt deprived when seeing an ex-SO with someone else?) 
and the time apart can be beneficial to the long-term friendship.  
In the last case, we ended up sort of sliding into a friendship state from a
relationship, and things worked out well enough.  There was quite a bit of pain
involved for me (since I wasn't the one who had decided that the relationship
wasn't working).  I realized and agreed that it was better to break up, yet it 
still hurt.  It's often hard to disassociate your logic from your emotions.

It certainly is possible.  I broke up an engagement with a woman
about 2 years ago.  We have remained close friends to this day.
The vital difference between this relationship and those I've had
with other women was that both of us had a friendship that extended
far beyond the romantic and sexual.  Even though we had to face the
fact that we couldn't get married (at least for the time being) we
both agreed that the time we had spent together (and could continue to
spend together) was just too valuable to throw away in a
fit of emotional pique.
In my opinion, this experience (and the googol of more or less successful
experiences which I have heard about) underlines what has got to be the
most frustrating dilemma that occurs between individuals.  The issue
of ""friends"" vs. ""more than friends"".  EVERYONE has had the experience
of being attracted to someone (romantically, that is) and being told
that ""we're just friends"" or ""I don't feel that way about you"".
What can be done about this?  Hell, I don't know, but I'll toss some
personal observations and inferences onto the net traffic just for fun:
I seem to observe that there is a significant difference between what
people desire, expect from, etc. from their friends and from their
SO's (isn't that brilliant? :-) ).  It is my conjecture, however, that
these criteria are sometimes defective or ill-chosen ESPECIALLY in the
case of the SO.  It has always been my personal belief that a solid
friendship is an absolute necessity as a basis for any romantic
relationship.  Now I'm sure that my terminal is going to rock with
responses claiming, in effect:  ""Of course I know that!  I am always
close friends with my SO.""  OK, but my suggestion is that wheras people
always claim that such is the case, they do not actually put such
opinions into action as effectively as they might.
I can't really speak for anyone on the net, but much personal experience
with myself and my friends has suggested that many people have
a real double standard for friends and SO's.  By far the worst thing
people do is to decide that a person is a candidate for romantic
affection on the basis of a ""tingle"" or some other type of transient
emotional reaction.  This is REALLY DUMB.  Would you choose all your
friends this way?  I doubt it.  People tend to take too emotional
an approach towards choosing a SO.  They refuse to look at a situation
rationally and try to understand what are the dynamics between themselves
and their SO.  I personally feel that if you cannot satisfy yourself
that you could become close, lasting friends with this individual then
you are courting disaster by trying to turn them into a romantic
object.  Why?  Because during the times when your gonads are in remission,
when all the hype and emotional highs are lows, you're going to need
all the trust and faith you can muster between the two of you in
order to have your relationship survive.  Such stuff is also the
main ingredient in any solid friendship.
I've rambled on enough.  If anyone reacts to this I'll be glad to
discuss this subject more.

I think this might warrant a little further discussion.  Now I know all
of you kind people will correct me if I'm wrong, but it has always been
my impression that people outgrow jealousy.  I mean at some point in
ones life, not necessarily marked by any big event, it becomes
acceptable to have friends of the the opposite sex.  My current SO goes
out to dinner, and whatever with an ex-SO (one that her parents hope
she'll marry) on a regular, if not common basis.  It doesn't bother me,
because, as I see it, one of the first things you and your SO have to do
is learn to trust one another.  By the same token, I often have my
friends over (some of which are (gasp!) female) for drinks, cards,
discussion, just plain fun (there are fun things to do other than sex
:-) ).  If my SO can't attend these, I feel that she trusts me in the
same sense.  I know that I would not be able to limit my social life
based on the jealousy of a SO, and wouldn't want anyone to limit their
social life because of my feelings.

I can agree with this more readily.  In fact I would go as far as saying
that sometimes the pain never does diminish to the extent that would
allow any other form of relationship.  Probably the hardest thing to do
is to form a ""new"" relationship with an old SO.  In spite of this, it
almost always has to be done.  It's obvious that things can't and won't
continue as they were, and one of the biggest hurts is knowing that
though you may still talk to and love each other, you can't express your
affection in the same way you once did. I think this may be one of the
hardest things in overcoming the SO to friendship transition.
> It can be hard to stop thinking of someone in sexual and ""possesive"" terms 
> (haven't you ever felt deprived when seeing an ex-SO with someone else?) 
> and the time apart can be beneficial to the long-term friendship.  
I once again agree here, to a certain extent at least.  I often feel
happy when I see and ex-SO with someone else.  It means that they have
been able to bounce back and didn't mope till the end of time over the
break-up.  One exception to this is when the ex-SO rubbed in the fact
that she was seeing someone else.  This is the only bitter parting I had
(of course, I've had so *many* partings :-) ).  The time you have to
think of a relationship after its end is important to where the
relationship will go from there.  I always try to think of what did
happen and a lot of the better aspects of the relationship, rather than
harp on the short comings and ""what could have been"".  I realize that
this is idealistic, and I can't say that I've always been able to do
this, but at least trying helps.
Well, out of here for now ...

[If this doesn't turn out quite right please overlook it
 as this is my first posting ever.]
 
Throughout High School I never dated much, in fact the few dates
I had were when the woman asked me.  When I first came to college
I went out on a few dates (where I was the initiator), and I started
dating one woman exclusively towards the end of my first year.
We then broke up for a summer and when we started seeing each
other again she seemed interested in having sex (e.g. she asked
me to spend the night) but at the time I wasn't really ready
(READ terrified, afraid, scared, etc.) so I politely told her
no (I know, I must have been crazy :-)), but some months later
after we had dated some more we did have sex (about 1 year after
we had first met).  It was the start of a terrific relationship
in which we ended up getting engaged about 18 months later (although
this didn't work out, but that's another story).  I am very glad
that I waited until I felt more sure of myself and that it was
something that I wanted to do.  It was a wonderful expierence
and one I shall always remember fondly.  The things which seemed
to really make a difference were our trust in and love for one
another.  For myself, I knew what I was and wasn't ready for
and things seemed to have worked out fine.  Peer pressure was
not a concern, and rightly so!

As a side note, pregnancies among teen-agers have been cited as an
indication of immaturity.  In my experience college freshpeople are not
significantly more mature then the previous year.  I am sure, however,
that their incidence of unwanted pregnancies is far less [someone could
check statistics, but I'm too lazy...].   I submit that this is due to
the availability of contraceptives through most college health
services. Returning to teen-agers, are their pregnancies due to
immaturity or difficulty in obtaining contraceptives?  Would YOU give
up sex if you they were unavailable?
As far as what I think is too young for sex...hmmm....well, its
whatever society frowns upon too severely.  I suspect that even level
of maturity at a given age is largely determined by societal
expectations and peer example.  In societies where 14 was
marrying-time, I suspect 14-year olds were quite mature [or matured
soon thereafter!].

	Are young men and women jumping into sex too early?
I will interpret ""young"" as college age, =>17. The answer to this is given
current birth control technology no. What I do not know how to do is draw
a barrier, is 16 too young, is 15 too young, is 14 too young, is 13 too
young, is 12 too young. 12 and 13 to me is definitely too young, while 14,
15 and 16 do not seem as clear, while 17 seems okay. The question is
really one of when can someone take full responsibility for their own
actions and the consequences of those actions. There are some 12 year olds
who can, while there are many adults who cann't. By the way any 12 year
old I have considered responsible would not have sex.
Unfortunately a lot of this depends on up bringing, and is very similar to
alcohol.  Where sex is restricted in the home, as in not discussed or
recognized, I believe that it is very difficult to develop a healthy
responsible attitude about sex.  In homes where a person's sexuality is
accepted from the time of birth as a part of the person, affection is
freely shown, and sex is not a taboo topic, then I believe that the
individual can decide for her/himself when to have sexual activity and
what is appropriate.  The same is true of alcohol, in homes where alcohol
is considered evil people have a hard time dealing with it, where alcohol
consumption is considered part of every day life people have no trouble
dealing with it.
	when is someone emotionally and mentally mature enough to have sex?
Each person must determine this for the themselves, and I do not believe
that there is any sure sign like the development of pubic hair.  First, I
believe a person must know how to care deeply about their friends and this
caring must be active, willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of
others. Second, I believe a person must be able to recognize when she/he
is being taken advantage of, used, or degraded.  Third, I believe a person
must have the ability to know when to end a relationship, when it is no
longer of benefit.  Further, the strength to end a bad relationship.
Fourth, a person must be able to love themselves and others without the
need for sex.  Fifth, a person must have a self identity, and confidence
in that identity.

Larry Welsch description of when a person is ready for sex sounds
more like when a person is ready for heaven.  Making participation
in an activity that is hardwired into our beings subject to
subjective personal development does not make it more natural.
Without the aspects of pregnancy, disease and coercion sex should
be looked on somewhere between eating and driving.  Like eating
there is a built in requirement, like driving, doing without
causes a varying amount of personal inconvenience, and again like driving,
it can be dangerous, and individuals should receive instruction.
But as for the attributes Larry lists, while I agree that relationships
where the involved parties possess these are ""better"",  I believe
that for those of us who do not enter physical maturity with
the majority of them, it is through trial and error that they
are acquired.  And this can not happen if we wait outside of
intimate relationships to perfect ourselves.  Some people are
fortunate in their upbringing, and know how to value themselves
and others, but others have to learn these lessons by risking the
pain involved in unsuccessful relationships.

1. Peer pressure. Especially for the guys, it's supposedly means you're

school level (and even among the gals), it's either ""you're missing out""
or ""you mean you *haven't* had sex yet?"" It some cases, it gets to the
point where one who has not had sex (whether by choice or not) winds up
somewhat lower on the pecking order (or completely outcast).
2. Pressure of competition. A gal may feel that she won't be able to
keep her guy if she doesn't have sex with him. In some (many?) cases,
she right - but if the lover would break up because you won't have sex,
(s)he's clearly after a body, not the person inside. Such a person OUGHT
to be gotten rid of - you'll be a lot better off without him/her.
3. Media pressure. Magazines, movies, radio, TV - sex, sex, and more
sex. The young person is all but directly told that s/he should be
having sex. Whether it's seeing a favorite screen idol doing it, or
seeing the Hollywood fake, the message is continually pounded in. The
young person feels as though it's *expected* of him/her.
The dormitory atmosphere intensifies it some. The fraternity/sorority
atmosphere can make the pressure irresistible. A lot of people go off to
school before they are mature enough to handle the pressure, and there
are a lot of people ready to take advantage of this and shape them as
they wish.

In answer to: ""When are people mature enough to have sex?""
I feel that a necessary level of maturity has been reached when a
person does not equate sex with love, nor believe that love, sex, and
friendship cannot exist within a relationship in various purmutations.
As an undergraduate student at a large university, I see a lot of
students attempting to use sex as a method of defining their own
worth as a human being; or trying to make a long term relationship
work merely because of an initial sexual encounter with someone.  Some
of these students are in graduate school and have obviously passed
that fuzzy time between ages 14 and 21 when most people expect
maturity to fully develop.  Perhaps only with experience will come the
necessary level of maturity.  (Wait--wasn't that part of the question,
I'm confused :-).

I don't know about you, but I'd have a bit of trouble having sex so often
that I had no oppertunity to get to know my partner better.  Sex has become
part of the getting-to-know process, not a replacement for it.  In fact,
after sex is often the best time to discuss those more intimate emotional
matters...  I suspect that this psychologist has some other reason for
her views.

Say whaaaa?  Past years in many cultures, notably Victorian, were times of

...such as supporting her own beliefs.  Ed is right.  ALWAYS suspect
sociologists, psychologists, etc.  With annoying frequency, one finds that
they tend to fix on an idea and set out to prove it rather than fixing on a
question and setting out to answer it.  (They're not all fools or

I suspect that many a (seemingly?) insensitive man may have a dream that some
""perfect"" woman is going to graciously, with incredible humility, take him as
SO and thereby, shall we say, forgive him his sins and redeem him; that by
submitting her (imagined) purity and perfection to the possible depredations
of his impurity and imperfection, she would somehow relieve him of the gnawing
pain that comes from knowing that no matter how much one grows as a person,
one is never perfect; one always has sins.  In other words, men are looking
for a woman to play the role of Christ in a visible, palpable manner.  It is
probably for this reason that a man takes it as such a special honor to be
the first man to have sex with a particular woman -- that she cares so much
for him that she sacrifices even her virginity for him -- a blood sacrifice,
yet!  Perhaps somehow the verse, ""Without shedding of blood there is no
remission [of sins]"" is floating around in their subconsciousnesses.
A darker possibility here is that a man may, at bottom, really have it in for
women -- really, actually, hate them, or at least bear a grudge against that
side of the human species.  Thus, if his feelings of attraction to women, or
to a particular woman, are carefully analyzed, he may actually be considering
her to be pure and perfect with an eye to how good it would feel (emotionally
as well as physically) to defile all that sweet purity.  Note that this
entails, again, his considering himself as wondrously impure, so that he can
be the defiling agent -- unless, of course, he can even gain pleasure from
the thought of a woman being defiled by someone other than himself, say by
rape, or by (if homosexuality disagrees with him, as it does with me)
lesbianism.
I have been criticized by one or two of my Christian brothers because I
sometimes do purchase Playboy.  But it is astonishing what you find out when
you ""show God your dirty pictures"", as one pastor friend of mine put it --
i.e. be appallingly honest about your sexual fantasies; Playboy can thus
sometimes serve as a focusing device.
Anyway, returning to the theme of my earlier paragraphs, what would seem to be
necessary for marriage or SO-ship is that a man become sufficiently accepting
of his own and everyone else's sins/imperfections that he can be intimate with
a woman who is just as sinful/imperfect as he is, and love her nevertheless.
My only question is:  how on earth can anyone pull this off?

on holidays anyway, I'll take the time to followup.
	From: aeq@pucc-h (Jeff Sargent)
	I suspect that many a (seemingly?) insensitive man may have a
	dream that some ""perfect"" woman is going to graciously, with
	incredible humility, take him as SO and thereby, shall we say,
	forgive him his sins and redeem him; that by submitting her
	(imagined) purity and perfection to the possible depredations
	of his impurity and imperfection, she would somehow relieve him
	of the gnawing pain that comes from knowing that no matter how
	much one grows as a person, one is never perfect; one always
	has sins.  In other words, men are looking for a woman to play
	the role of Christ in a visible, palpable manner.
I, personally, am not looking for someone to redeem my sins, either Christ
or a woman.  I have my own standards of right and wrong, but they seem
considerably easier to live within than the Christian ones (judging by the
difficulty Christians seem to have) and so I don't ""sin"", by my standards,
very often.  And when I do, I seem to be able to forgive myself eventually.
And I see very little sign of longing for redemption among my closer friends,
either.
	It is probably for this reason that a man takes it as such a
	special honor to be the first man to have sex with a particular
	woman -- that she cares so much for him that she sacrifices
	even her virginity for him -- a blood sacrifice, yet!
I don't consider virginity to be particularly precious.  And the loss of
virginity does not need to involve the shedding of blood!  What are you
going to do, Jeff, if you have sex with a virgin and she doesn't bleed?
Are you going to think she was lying about her virginity, or will you
believe her but feel less honoured because she didn't bleed?  And what
happens if you don't quite feel fully redeemed afterwards - do you have
to go out and find another virgin?  (I'm deliberately being facetious
here - I'm trying to illustrate why I think treating virginity as
a precious commodity is silly.)
	A darker possibility here is that a man may, at bottom, really
	have it in for women -- really, actually, hate them, or at
	least bear a grudge against that side of the human species.
	Thus, if his feelings of attraction to women, or to a
	particular woman, are carefully analyzed, he may actually be
	considering her to be pure and perfect with an eye to how good
	it would feel (emotionally as well as physically) to defile all
	that sweet purity.  Note that this entails, again, his
	considering himself as wondrously impure, so that he can be the
	defiling agent ...
You seem to be saying, basically, that the man is attracted to the woman
because he wants to hurt her.  Probably some men are, but I don't think
this is predominant in the attitudes of very many men.  And for this to
work, you still have to see the woman as ""perfect"" and thus subject to
being ""defiled"".  A woman is a human being, not a church!
	But it is astonishing what you find out when you ""show God your
	dirty pictures"", as one pastor friend of mine put it -- i.e. be
	appallingly honest about your sexual fantasies; Playboy can
	thus sometimes serve as a focusing device.
Honesty about yourself to yourself is usually a good thing....
	Anyway, returning to the theme of my earlier paragraphs, what
	would seem to be necessary for marriage or SO-ship is that a
	man become sufficiently accepting of his own and everyone
	else's sins/imperfections that he can be intimate with a woman
	who is just as sinful/imperfect as he is, and love her
	nevertheless.
	My only question is:  how on earth can anyone pull this off?
My reply is: It is possible to accept oneself.  And if you can accept
yourself, you probably can accept others too on the same terms.
And I really don't like your use of ""nevertheless"" - you seem to be
implying that love is associated with perfection, and that it may
require effort to learn to love someone even if they aren't perfect.
Rubbish.  Can't you love someone's faults as well as their good
features?  Wait, I'll make a yet stronger statement:  If you see
someone as perfect, you can worship them but you cannot really love
them at all.  It is only the real, imperfect people that you can love,
not the pedestalized perfect ones.
I would say that you, Jeff, need to learn to accept yourself for
yourself, rather than looking for a woman to accept you and thus make
everything alright.  And yes, I know it's difficult.  (I have a
difficult time seeing myself as lovable and desirable during the times
when there is no one that visibly sees me in that way.)  But looking
for a woman whose presence will change your life is, I think, the wrong
approach.

Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff--you told us you were getting better.
Most of us with SO's desire them for companionship--you know,
warmth.  Not for confession or psychoanalysis.  Just to be with.
Such people are easy to find once you figure out that sinners
are intrinsically more interesting than saints.
As for these sacrifices-of-the-saintly-purity-of-virginity
fantasies, Jeff, I think you've been reading too much lives of the
saints, who had woefully little experience in this area.  This
""special honor"", ""blood sacrifice"", temple-of-the-holy-spirit
stuff may be entertaining philosophy, but it won't get you to
first base.  Not lusty enough.  Think bawdy.
Most people I know had their first sexual experiences in their teens,
when everything in the world is exciting and confusing (ah, those
hormones, like a sugar maple on a warm day in March!) and memories
of embarrassing bumbling are quickly forgotten in a jumble of new
experiences and you don't know who you are from one day to the next
anyway.  It must be a real nightmare for an adult with a bad self-
image and a good memory.  I feel for you, Jeff.

I don't know who should be more insulted by this-- men, women, or Gods. I
know I am. Is it my imagination or is Jeff contracting a serious case of
Religion on the Brain? Jeff, last time I looked, they didn't let women be
priest. Asking them to absolve you of your guilt isn't in their job
description. True, a woman who wants to be my SO will have to accept my
faults and foibles because I'm not going to change them just for her (I
might change them if I decide I want to, but not because she wants me to).
Also, I'm going to accept hers on the same level. But asking her to take
away the guilt of being you is silly! You shouldn't be guilty for being you
in the first place. If you don't LIKE the way you are and are creating all
of these feelings of guilt about it, don't ask someone for absolution. Ask
yourself WHY you don't like yourself and then go out and change it.
Anything else is a cop out. If you don't like yourself you will find that
it is VERY hard for others to like you. Believe me, it shows.

Ack. Should I laugh, or should I throw up? The historical purposes of
virginity were simply that it was the only way that you could truly prove
that anything that popped back out later was yours. Bloodlines tended to be
VERY important for things like inheritances and so proof of the bloodline
was similarly important. There is also (in cases) situations where a person
gives someone they care for something they can only give once (well, it can
be successfully faked, but that is beside the point.) Blood sacrifices?
What are we, cannibals? Even us druids gave up blood sacrifices ages (well,
weeks) ago...

Jeff, what HAVE you been smoking? I'd love a couple of Kilo's if you have
any to spare. Should do wonders for my meditation... (joke, dammit!) As far
as I know (please let me know if I'm wrong...) there are only two ways a
man can tell a virgin from a non-virgin. 1) she tells him. 2) he hunkers
down on his haunches and looks. I've never noticed any difference in things
like smell, and from the stats on teenage (and pre-teenage!) pregnancy age
certainly doesn't do any good. I don't even pretend to understand your
meanins and mootivations of this-- they certainly don't jibe with mine,
whatever they are. I would rather just have a nice pleasant evening helping
someone feel good. That isn't impure, and I'm certainly not out to defile
them. Of course, maybe I'm different from the rest of the world. Again.

Hmm... maybe I AM different. The best part of Playboy for me is the
fiction. Oh, well... I worry a LOT about people who are so insecure about
they own sexuality that they need to foist their insecurities on others to
prove that they are appropriate. If you like Playboy (and whatever it
brings into your mind) there isn't anything wrong with that.

sigh. Jeff, I think you worry too much...
>My only question is:  how on earth can anyone pull this off?
The easiest way I've found is to simply stop worrying about it and let it
happen...

As I read it, in Genesis 2:24, ""For this reason a man will leave his father
and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.""  It
doesn't seem to me that a man is looking for a woman to play the role of
Christ in his life, rather that in finding that woman, *together* they can
glorify God.  It was God's idea that man should not be alone (Genesis 2:20)
and that is why he made woman.

I'm finding it hard to reply to this, because (1) I don't agree with it but (2)
I don't really consider myself an authority on the subject, having never been
married and not really having an SO (just occasional dates).  I guess (to me)
you become involved with someone because of mutual goals, similar likes and
dislikes, companionship (as ken perlow has stated below) and some commitment
to the relationship (as the relationship approaches marriage I guess the com-
mitment gets stronger).  I don't see how sins and imperfections have anything
to do with it.

However, I do not agree with ken perlow's last statement.  It seems to be a
myth among non-Christians that Christians are boring people.  Why do people
think this way?  (Reminds me of the line in ""Only the Good Die Young"" -- I'd
rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, the sinners are much
more fun.)  If going to prayer meetings or gospel concerts isn't your bag,
don't do it and don't associate with people who do it!  But don't label these
people as *boring* just because they don't do the things you like to do,
because their lives are just as fulfilled to them as yours are to you, and
most Christians I've met do not feel that non-Christians lead dull lives,
just different.

Another thing that I disagree with is this attitude of people that you should
have ""experience"".  If you don't want ""experience"" but rather to be with some-
one who you really care for, would have/be the father of their baby, would 
stand behind them, etc., doesn't mean you're strange, just that you want some-
thing else out of a relationship outside of sexual gratification.  (I'm not
saying sexual gratification is bad either, *if that's what you want*, then go
for it, but don't belittle the people who don't want it, because their reasons
are just as good for not wanting it as yours for wanting it.)

About the only thing that I agree with in the previous paragraph is that life
is exciting and confusing when you're a teenager (however, I'm 23 and life is
still confusing, if not exciting :-).  I don't want to speak for Jeff, but (I'm
going to anyway) it seems to me that he would benefit from a loving and caring
SO (wife maybe?).  You're right in that he can't expect his SO to heal him,
but perhaps they can fill the gaps in each other's lives.

I don't know what you disagree with.  Didn't you do crazier things when

A-men brother!  :-)
pardon if i seem blunt and harsh, but i think i need to take Jeff to task.
so its time for this Christian to ask Jeff where on earth (or above it)
are you comming from?  try dealing with women as PEOPLE.  remember that
they are loved by God too.  
i dont see why Jeff needs to mix Freud with the bible.  i try to treat
people (male and female) as people.  (thats the idea i get from the
bible)  sex is one of those wonderful things God placed in this world.
dont you think Adam and Eve enjoyed it before the fall in Eden?  it
seems to me that only after the fall into sin that they started having
guilt trips about sex...  you got a extreme Madonna syndrome going. :-)

Perhaps he is afraid of his (as you call them) lustful thoughts.  Well Jeff,
I guess I have to agree with ken on this one, it's ok to feel that way about
your SO/wife (provided that what you do with your SO/wife is an expression
of love).  It's only natural to want to have an intimate relationship.  We as
human beings were built that way.  God didn't create Eve so that Adam could
put her up on a pedestal, but to be a helper and companion.

for the *context* of what he is saying.  I found his comments on the
similarity between the traditional attitudes towards women and
Christian mythology to be extremely insightful.  (NOTE: I am not
passing judgement on the validity of Christian belief by my use
of the word ``mythology''--mythology does *not* equal fiction.)
He didn't say that all men felt the way he described, or even that
he necessarily felt that way himself.
That some men are looking for an SO to ``forgive'' them is simply a
statement of fact.  That some men want their SO's to be ``pure''
is another fact.  I've met men who fit one or both of these--enough
men to say that perhaps these things are an ingrained part of our
culture.  And I think the ``light'' and ``dark'' sides are connected:
in order to ``grant absolution'' a woman must be ``pure''.  Is the
sexual revolution so complete that even more traditional men no
longer desire virgin brides?  Hardly.  The double standard still
lives here, as well as in our attitudes toward infidelity.
Guilt is still such a large element of our culture that Jeff's
observations should come as no surprise to anyone.  Throwing off
the bindings of childhood-inculcated guilt feelings can be one
of the most difficult tasks of a lifetime.  Trivializing this
by saying it is ``irrational'' and therefore no problem does no
good whatever.  Using an SO to help loosen these binds of guilt
makes a certain amount of sense, since intimate relationships
often take the place of the prototypes provided by parental
relationships.  (For instance, lots of men seem to be looking
for someone to continue mothering them.)  This is an unhealthy
solution to an unhealthy problem, perhaps, though I sometimes
wonder if such ``unhealthy'' things might not be natural phases
in a process of personal growth.  And, as a non-believer myself,
I can still see the usefulness in having God ``help'' free oneself
from guilt; if this works, isn't it far better than using another
human being for the same thing?
I was surprised at the gross intolerance displayed by some of the
people who replied to Jeff's article.  Chuq in particular usually
displays far more compassion than he did here.  He and I have
discussed the problem of guilt before, and I know he knows better.

Actually, you're right...usually.  Every once in a while, God can even use
Playboy to zap one with an insight into a twist in one's own feelings about
relationships, sexuality, or whatever.
I could comment that you don't need Playboy, since you have access to a woman
who is beautiful to you (I have no idea of her physical appearance, but she's
certainly beautiful to you) at any time you reasonably desire -- and not just
to a view of her, but to her reality.  Of course, in order for you to not need
or want to examine Playboy, this would also imply that you are strong enough
to handle having a real woman in your life, who may not always behave quite the
way you would most want, and who has some degree of control over you -- as
distinct from fantasies (with or without the aid of photos), which you control
entirely.  More power to you!  I'm not sure I'm at that point; the thought of
having an SO, now that I examine it more closely, is frightening.

Question for Paul DuBois:  Are you married?
Seriously though, Jeff has brought up a valid point.  If he is married, then
he doesn't need Playboy obviously.  In general though, I think the point is
that those Christians who are married have a distinct advantage that they can
have sex with their SOs and not feel guilty.  But what about us Christians
who aren't married and have to keep our hormones on a leash?

I, on the other hand agree with Robert Heinlein on this point.
In ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" Michael finally ""Groks God""
while having sex with Dorcas.  I don't think God is hung up
about genitalia and the use thereof and looking thereat.
I'm not going to be hung up about them either.  Actaully,
why am I submitting this?  I just remember that I've been
p.o.'ed about seeing all this religion-related flaming in
a group that should be devoted to talking about getting laid.
Well, this article talks about that, and it's funny, too, so
I guess I'll submit it.  Sorry....

Like it or not, there are some worthwhile things in Playboy (or at
least there used to be:-).  There's also some trash.  PARTS of the magazine
are degrading to women.  Actually, Playboy as I recall it significantly
overlaps Bon Appetit, Road and Track, maybe a bit of the New Yorker.  Best

First off, could you tell me just what need it is that is satisfied by both
a wife and Playboy magazine?  (Sounds like a koan for 20-th century
America, doesn't it?:-)  There seems to be some confusion in this whole
mess over Playboy--some think it incites the passions; some think it is a
surrogate satisfier.
If Christianity vs hormones is a problem, I suggest that you look again to
your religion.  It better have an answer for you, because the hormones are
there just as they should be, doing what they're supposed to do.  I'll give
you one clue:  ""Ignore them"" ain't a useful answer.

Well, not being an avid reader of Playboy, I really can't say whether is it
worthwhile or not.  I have heard comments by others that the articles are good
reading material, but what I was commenting on, mostly, was the nudity.

Well, ok, I see your point.  Perhaps the wording of Jeff's article is degrading,
but I don't think that was his intent.  I think I misread his posting, and
associated it with married vs. non-married (read on) ...

I think I have erred here.  What I was probably getting at was that once one is
married, one is able to make love to one's partner, relieving one of the necess-
ity of looking at Playboy or what-have-you.  (I know that it is not necessary
to be married to make love to someone, but this is an accepted rule by most
Christians.)  In retrospect, I realize that it's not necessary to turn to
Playboy or anything else to satisfy one's needs (I don't).

Since it has been said that this discussion doesn't belong in net.singles,
I'll refrain from comment here, and continue on in net.religion (when I'm
more awake).

The etymology of ""motas"" is not directly acronymic.  Motos = member
of the opposite sex, but the ""-os"" suffix in Romance languages is
a masculine ending.  The corresponding feminine suffix is ""-as"".
Thus, ""motas"" to designate a female significant other.
I have always found the ""o"" for ""opposite"" much too antagonistic,
preferring ""complementary"".  Although ""motcs"" is harder to pronounce,
it does permit the shorthand ""mot(cs)^2"" for ""significant other in
the same line of work.""

I'm getting a lot of flak for noting that ""motas"" means
""a female motos"".  It seems that the prevailing net use is
as the acronym ""member of the appropriate sex"", i.e., a
generic SO.  I'm pretty sure this was not the original
meaning, though, since there are all kinds of ways to
designate a non-sex-specific significant other, like ""SO"".
There aren't, however, many other good ways to say ""boyfriend""
or ""girlfriend"" without the age/sexism implicit in those terms.
""Motos"" and ""motas"" fit the bill, so I use them as I originally
noted.  Perhaps Chuq could update the netiquette document to
reflect this.

reference to MOTAS had A = *appropriate*.  It was originally coined in
an article which explored all of the various combinations one could
produce from MOT*S, replacing the * with one or more letters depending
on how many letters it takes to describe the preferred sex (also
depending on how many different sexes or sexualities you are willing to
allow).  Also, there are several other acronyms which appear from time
to time, notably posslq and SO.  SO seems to have finally won the
battle with posslq for ""how do you describe the person you live with in
an intimate, meaningful relationship possibly outside of marrige"".
posslq derived from a 1970 census form which had a classification for
""persons of opposite sex sharing living quarters"", but is restrictive
in the same way MOTOS is restrictive - it assumes a heterosexual
orientation.  SO stands for ""significant other"" and is the shortest
description which seems to cover the widest possibilities: living
together, dating, married, hetero, homo, bi, etc.
I always enjoy reading what everyone *thinks* some acronym stands for,
especially since some of the guesses are pretty wild (see the ""grep""
discussion in unix-wizards!)

        Laziness and/or unintendended ignorance, I guess; it's
much easier to deal with a group as a group than to separately
acknowledge the various sub-groups within the group.  It would be
easy (to use an analogy) to say that 'Black people do this' in
discussing certain behaviors that are practiced almost
exclusively by Black males. 
        Of course, this is not meant to condone the behavior you
describe in any way.  I am aware that the proportion of lesbian
AIDS victims to male homosexual AIDS victims is very low. 
        However, if perhaps the lesbian community were to become
more visible (both to male homosexuals and to heterosexuals),
then this tendency to lump the lesbian community in with the male
homosexual community would decrease.

   First of all, since by your own admission, you are not a straight person,
what makes you an expert on what straight people think?
   Secondly, it's not clear to me that you are right.
   Thirdly, if your observation *is* correct (let's assume it is for the 
moment), it may not be due to malice or bias against lesbians. It may just
be that in straight relationships men and women are much more similar,
by which I mean every straight relationship involves a man and a woman.
There isn't such a dicotomy in straight relationships as there is in gay
ones, where there are two distinct classes (male and female). Straights
maybe aren't used to the idea of two distinct types.

Why do some people think ""homosexual"" implies ""male""?  I can think of
two reasons.
I suspect that the word may have become specialized in the same way as
""man"", which originally referred to any human being -- and for the same
reasons.

A second possibility is that people confuse the Greek root ""homo-"" with
the Latin word.  (And are ignorant of the fact that the Latin means
""person"" rather than ""male"").

that there are more male homosexuals than female ones.  If true, this may also
contribute to people's impressions.
I must add that I, too have used ""homosexual"" in context where I felt it would
be taken as referring to a male, whereas I usually refer to female homosexuals
as lesbians.  However, I believe that most people realize that ""homosexuality""
can describe the persuasion (I couldn't think of a better word for it, offhand)
of both men and women.

This is silly: because lots of them make so much noise about it.  They make 
noise by talking, by using words, and, according to what Trish sees, the noise
mostly equates ""homosexual"" with ""male"".
[I think ""lesbian"" is a much nicer sounding word; I don't know, it has a nice
long ""z"".  And it only refers to women--kind of neat!, where ""homosexual"" can
mean women or men.]{But then, I can't go around saying people should like being
called something just because I like to say the word, and that's not what I'm
trying to express when I say such.}
Growing up, I hear a lot more taunts about male homosexuals than female 
homosexuals: ""lesbo"" was only a spook word to teach us we were no longer
allowed to touch each other in junior high (no more running holding hands 
on the playground :-( ), but we'd hear a lot more of ""homo"", used not only
for no-touch, but also for any boy who was behind in other aspects of
development, or who didn't act down to all the tough-guy norms (and there are
many more possibilities for ""defects"" and therefore name-calling here)[hey!
and don't forget all those long-hair hippy males suspected by >30ers of 
not-macho behavior].  Perhaps since boys didn't have their own word, but 
girls could (and I would hear ""homo"" referred to girls too), when we get 
older and use the long words (and maybe not even as a taunt! :-) ) we've by now
gotten ""homosexual"" tied to some sort of applies-to-men-mostly feeling.
I found some lost memory, faded and listing no references, kicking around in 
the dust here in the cave that refers to Queen Victoria declaring that women 
don't do such awful (her coloring, not mine!) things, and therefore influencing
legistlation against homosexuals so that it explicitly referred to not-women
(==men :-)! ).
Anyway, I didn't think that all straights always mean ""male"" when they say
""homosexual"".  But it is interesting that this is Trish's observation, and it
is worthy of thought that homosexual women find this aggravating.  We can
think about our hidden context next time we say ""homosexual"".

It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men and
women"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc.  The
linguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words as
pseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language.
Yet one can see the results of this.  Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she""
(unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean just
what the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptions
abound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners.
Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, or
else the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right?
(""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."")  This is why
many people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER,
police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid having
people assume that they refer to males.  Insisting that ""a policeman can
be a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (even
subconsciously) to mean policeMAN.  Notice that even a word like homosexual
(which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) gets
interpreted to mean ""male homosexual"".  (Thus it may not be just in
particular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions that
if no gender is specified, we're talking about males.)
Also, of course, there are other factors.  (Like assuming that the words
homosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive.  I seem to remember that a
lot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ...""
specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.)  But if you think about
it, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say a
word that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"".

I guarantee it's terminology - there is no word which means specifically male
homosexual, in the way that lesbian means female homosexual.  Therefore, most
people will assume that, if you meant women, you'd use lesbian: using the
so-called generic ""homosexual"" leads most people to conclude lesbians are not
included.   Now, if someone would like to invent a male equivalent word ....

Regarding the growing practice of using ""homosexual"" to mean only ""male
homosexuals"", I think one of the problems here is that there isn't any
word in English (that I can think of, anyway) to refer to just male
homosexuals.
""Lesbian"" quite clearly refers to just women homosexuals, so there's no
problem here.  But what do you use when you want a word for just male
gays?  ""Gay"" won't really do, because it has acquired generic meanings
too, and is often used in forms such as ""gay women"".
So I guess what we need is a new word, so female homosexuals won't
get lumped in with the male ones wholesale.

and women that I know) gays have a general idea of how straights think
because they are raised as straights.  Unfortunately, we aren't blessed
with a society whose parents might consider that their children might
not be heterosexual.  From my experience, children on this planet tend
to be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of their
own.  Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, it
makes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straights
think.
	As for straights thinking of men only when considering
homosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right.  Ask
any ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like.  The
odds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someone
who wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be a
transvestite.  Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pride
celebrations, few women are seen.  Perhaps if lesbians were more
visible to the outside world, they might become part of the stereotype
(if, indeed, this is desirable).

heterosexual males on girl children.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Not on something that has NO bearing on a
child's education!  Were that teacher found incompetent (sp?), or
were they a child molester- then, definitely.  But dammit, being gay
has nothing at all to do with a child's education!  Homosexuality != 
perversion (that's does NOT equal, and by ""perversion"" I mean the more 
colloquial [sp?] usage of the word...I don't want to get sidetracked into
a psychological discussion).  A few years ago someone very close
to me told me they were a homosexual.  Did our relationship change?
Of course not!  Why not?  Because WE didn't!  There was nothing weird
about him; I never suspected he was ""different"".  That's because he
basically isn't.

See the above.  I think they should only be able to remove a teacher
when there's something about the teacher that would be a bad influence
or have a negative effect on the children.  If anything, I think having
a gay teacher would help the kids become more open-minded; perhaps
gays wouldn't be so maligned in the future if youngsters could see that
they're not ""fairies"" or ""dykes"", but like everybody else.  Those were
the misconceptions I and my contemporaries had concerning gays when we
grew up  (BTW, by ""gays"" I refer to both female and male homosexuals-
it's just that that word is more difficult to type!)
Anyhow, there it is in a nutshell.

	I believe that what a teacher does in the privacy of his/her own
bed has no bearing whatsoever on his/her ability to teach children
readin', 'ritin', or 'rithmetic.
	Parents have no rights to remove a specific teacher, but do have
the right to send their children to any private or public school.  Parents
do have the right to file complaints with the school board, who obviously,
can collect all the evidence before proceeding to determine which teachers
to tenure, and which to dump.  If you don't want your children brainwashed
in uncle sam's brainwashing machine, send them to a private school.  Or
keep them home and teach them yourself.  And throw out the television.
	Homosexuality exists all around you, and if you think you only
have to worry about your children at school, you'd better think again about
the other children they hang-out with,  or they just might find out about
its existance anyway.  Who cares?  Gender identity and mate's identity are
determined before age 2, and nobody sends kids to school before age 5.
They ain't gonna become homosexuals just because their teachers are.  Gee...
for high-school sex-ed, it might not be a bad idea to require both a straight
and a gay teacher for every class.  (you think homosexuals didn't go to school?)
	Now, when your child's history teacher starts practicing sexuality
with his/her students in or after class, who cares whether its homo or hetero?
That's grounds for removal by the school board.  i.e. the issue is not
homosexuality, but sexuality.  Teachers have no place dealing with their own
sexuality in the classroom except in the parental-optioned sex-ed class in
high school.  There students should have both gay and straight teachers, unless
you want to teach the gay students in separate-but-equal sex-ed classes :-).

Many parents who may be very tolerent of homosexuals in their midsts (myself

abhorent and seek to remove any influences that lead the child in that
direction.  I view public schools and the teachers therein to be the employees
of the parents in this and should represent an extension of the views of the
parents.  Hence they have the right to choose the teachers of their children.
In my own high school experience I encountered one homosexual teacher and he
actively seduced or recruited partners from his students and I know from
this experience that having these advances being made is very confusing for
an adolescent and creates additional pressure which a teenager should not
have to deal with.
Further, I beleive homosexuality is a learned abnormality, i.e. it is the
result of environmental influences rather than congenital or genetic causes.

I would choose to eliminate influences that would ultimately lead my child

After posting my reply to the homosexual teacher question I realized I
hadn't stated my point as well as I would have liked.
The mere fact of a teacher's homosexuality should never be grounds for
removal.  If it is at all obvious the teacher is gay then there may be an
issue to deal with.  Any overt expressions of homosexuality cannot be
tolerated any more than we would tolerate a teacher who made sexual comments.
It is entirely possible to conduct classes in any subject, including sex,
without admiting or revealing ones own sexual preferences and in fact an
admission or announcement of sexual preferences of any kind are out of place.
I've had a teacher who openly equated mental maturation with puberty, ""You
grow up here (pointing to his head) when you grow up down there.""  He also
liked to snap bra straps.  My high school band director was gay and seduced
his students, I resisted but a friend of mine sucumbed.  For the last 2 years
of high school and the 6 years he lived after that were years of torment for
him which lead him to drinking and wild driving which killed him.  These are

teachers?  I know several gay teachers, and none of them would have
anything to do with their students sexually.  Besides which, I am
totally certain that hetrosexual teachers approach their students
(of the opposite sex) for sexual favours much more often than gay
teachers approach their students (of the same sex).  (If nothing else,
the numbers should work out that way.  After all, only 6-10% of the
population is gay, one may assume that the teaching profession has
no greater incidence of homosexualallity than the basic population,
and the vast majority of gay people are not into children... just like
the straight community.)  Anyway, I will agree that that one teacher
may not have been up to the standards of the teaching profession,
and should have been removed as a teacher; not because he/she was gay,
but because he/she was seducing his/her students from a power position.
Also, what gives you the idea that the young men that your single
teacher could make his students gay?  It is far more likely that
those he was successful in approaching were, in fact, gay already,
since it is claimed that sexuality (affectational prefferance) is
fixed by the time a child is 2 or 3 years old.  It is likely that
such young gentlemen (or women) were suffering from the effects
of the suppression of their of their sexuality, due to the fact of
the intense oppression gay people have suffered and are suffering
still.  After all when ""everyone"" tells you that being gay is
wrong/sinfull/evil, and you still feel these things, it tends to
mess up ones mind.
Finally, what life of anguish?  Most of the gay persons that I
know (and there are a great number of them), are normal people
with normal lives.  My life (which is the only one that I should
really comment on, although many of my friends would, I am sure,
agree with me) is very much normal.  I work, play, and sleep,
just as you do.  I have my joys and sorrows, just as you do.
Basically, my life is as happy as that of most anybody you ever
met or ever will.  My only major concern is that everyone be
able to live their own lives, do work which they like and are
comfortable with, and be able to live where they they will (and
can afford).","0W0d3fF-FacJ",14,1984-07-20,5,1

If you've got a teacher teaching sexual mores to gradeschool kids, then
yes, work to get rid of the teacher.  Homosexuality doesn't have anything
to do with it.  That seems to be the point you've missed, both in the
original and in your followup.  The issue is not related to the private
life of the teacher.  That isn't any of your damn business.  If the teacher
is teaching (or otherwise promoting in the classroom) sensitive topics not
relevant to what is supposed to be taught, the teacher is wrong.  PLEASE
NOTE that I did not say ""sensitive viewpoints"" - I said ""sensitive topics""
and I mean ""regardless of what view is expressed on those topics...""
>Kids at this age are extremely impres-

This statement is a good one - the ""neutrality"" is the main point.  It's
the same as the point I was tryin to make in the preceding paragraph.
Again - if you've got a teacher who is teaching sexual attitudes in a
gradeschool, you've got a valid complaint - but homosexuality is a red
herring.

quote that I saw from it, and the flavor of a couple of the responses has
me concerned.
     I teach at a high school, and the idea that public pressure should be
just cause for the removal of a teacher is questionalble at best (or at 
least I feel it is questionalble). For one thing, we need to recognize that
the majority (of parents, of teachers, of the public, etc.) has a remarkable
tendency to exhibit sheep herd qualities. This is to say that they can be
easily whipped up into a frenzy without actually examining what they're get-
ting worked up about. All of Germany got worked up during the 30's and 40's,
but would you say that they were right to remove Jewish teachers from the
schools? The public in Tennessee called for the removal of a teacher who
taugh Darwin's theory of the origin of species. Were they right to do this?
I'm not saying that either the state of Tennessee or the Germans didn't have
the legal right to do what they wanted to with their teachers, but I do
question whether they were RIGHT to exercise that right.
     Another point that I would raise, is the question of a parent's
qualifications. I would not suggest that all teachers know what is best for
their students, nor would I say that teachers necessarily know more about
education than parents. I would, however, suggest that an experienced
teacher might have a better idea of what he/she is up to in the classroom,
than a parent who objects to the subject matter, or the methodology of a
class. The reason I raise this point at all, is because I believe that
opening a teachers lifestyle to public scrutiny and approval will lead to
opening their opinions, beliefs, and methods of teaching to the same sort
of scrutiny, and the same sort of threat of removal for holding to ways
not approved of by the majority.
    Lastly (I realize I'm running on a bit here), I think that the question
about the teacher's sexual preference is irrelevant. So long as a teacher
does not flaunt, or try to coerce students into, his/her sexual orientation,
that orientation is nobody's damned business. It is as wrong to glorify
and flaunt hetrosexuality in the classroom as it is to do the same with
homosexuality.

	Larry, you are quoting the Declaration of Independence, which
    is no law of the US government.   While the sentiments that are
    revealed in that document are important, they (especially the
    *religious* portions) are just an opinion.   Please do not confuse
    the religion of our founding fathers, with the logic which led them
    to create the government they did.   Amazingly enough, *they* were

    easiest way to encourage tyranny.

the hell out of me to have folks running around trying to convince me that 
I can't live without one.  This is why I don't (for instance) subscribe
to net.religion; just to avoid the conversionist crap.
	As far as religion (separate issue from god) is concerned, there's
no good advice or assistance available there either; this silly pompous
old man in Rome tells us ""No birth control, kiddies"", and ""No abortions"",
and ""No sex until you're married"" and ""No sex when you're married *unless* 
you make babies"", and thus screws up more folks' lives with unnecessary guilt
feelings, and unwanted children, and repressed sexuality than anyone else
I can think of.  Similar messages are heard from other religious leaders,
occasionally embellished with ""Don't dance"" and ""Don't wear this kind of
clothing"" and ""Don't read that"" and other miscellaneous admonishments against
most of the really enjoyable things in life.  These bozos know nothing of
the realities of being single; you'll get much better and much wiser advice

	By the way, some of the BEST advice on personal relationships, love,
sex, and whatever is to be found in ""The Rape of the A.P.E. (American Puritan 
Ethic)"" by (of all people) Allen Sherman.  It examines the sexual revolution, 
whatever that is/was, and includes a hysterical chapter entirely devoted to 
the work ""fuck"", which is something you won't find in just *any* book.  It's 
a hard book to find, but very much worth the effort.

If you don't like Jeff's religious statement, withhold your own (the
above is an example). It looks like Rsk has swallowed the same
misinformation the rest of the world has, that Christianity is a
""negative"" religion. Fooey. Christianity is ""Thou shalt"" - and the power
to do things that are really enjoyable. (C.S.Lewis's ""Screwtape Letters""
deal with ""pleasures"" much more deeply, and quite accurately.)
Those ""bozos"" know a lot more about being single than you'd ever know,
especially this rabbi known as Paul. He who doesn't learn from the
wisdom of the ages, makes the same mistakes.

work for everyone. I don't want to start a discussion here that really belongs
in net.religion, but let's face it: in order for religion to be of some help
to you, you have to be able to believe many very important things for which 
there is absolutely no hard scientific evidence (that I can see), solely on
the word of other human beings.  Lots of people with analytical minds (like me) 
have a great deal of trouble with this. (If you want to continue this argument
with me, let's do it by private mail, since this really doesn't belong here. 
However, I think I'm justified posting this one article since you have stated 
your views here several times.)
  I don't know about you, but when I get lonely, one thing that makes me get
""desperate"" is just plain old biology. I have a sex drive (surprise!), and when
it goes for long periods without satisfaction, I become unhappy both physically
and emotionally, just as I would if deprived of food or sleep.  Human beings
also have emotional drives (in this case, for love and affection), which are
less well understood, but nevertheless real. I submit that it is these
physical and emotional drives that cause people to become ""desperate"". The
Christians are really into guilt trips, it seems to me. Everyone is bad,
we are all sinners. I just don't believe that, and I believe it is a *very*
destructive way to think. Guilt is *not* the only motivation, nor is it
even the primary one, at least for most of the people I know. I think love
and hate are *far* more powerful, and biology (hunger, sex drive, etc.)
more powerful still. I believe it is those who have strong feelings of guilt
about something that turn to Christianity (and other religions; no need
to pick exclusively on the Christians) because it promises the ultimate
relief from guilt. I don't really intend to put down Christianity here;
if it makes *you* feel better to believe it, great. Just try to remember
that not everyone feels as guilty as you do or looks at the world the same
as you.

I know that it is a personal thing, but for me the `desperation' is
not so much a biological (or `hormonal') need as it is just a desire
to give and receive affection.  If worst comes to worse, I can take
care of the sexual part myself.  And I can give myself a certain
amount of affection.  But there just isn't a substitute for sharing
a hug, a touch, or an admiring glance, with someone I care about.
Were I to choose between this without sex, or a series of one-night
stands, I know what my choice would be...

Sigh....  I never expected to have so many responses to one sentence.  I will
say briefly that there is considerable archaeological evidence; that the word
of human beings is the way one gets interested in God, but when you actually
come to know God, you have something (Someone) more than that as a foundation
for your belief, Someone with whom you have a dynamic relationship, not just a
bunch of words; and that I probably have just as analytical a mind as you do.
Greg also pointed out that people have physical sex drives and emotional needs
for closeness.	I fully agree.	Note that my article was not saying that guilt
was the ONLY motive a given person would have for desperation (it wasn't in my
case), nor that all desperate people must necessarily feel guilty about
something (I don't know all desperate people, so I can't know that); I was
merely pointing out the root of some of my feelings in the hope that it would
encourage others to look at themselves, see if their feelings had similar
roots, and deal with them if so.
Greg also blamed my Christianity for my guilt trip.  I admit that many people
(including Christians) view Christianity as being a system of rules.  Of
course it isn't; the name of the game is not avoidance of sin, but freedom
from sin.  Still, even though I'm not in the rigid fundamentalist tradition,
I still sometimes tend to feel that I ought to be punished for my sins and
failures -- but I don't feel that way so much because of my Christianity
(though I do have trouble reconciling God's justice, which I feel I deserve,
with His mercy, which I crave), but because I'm a terrible perfectionist and
have been since long before I knew anything about Christianity.
(Why is the above paragraph in here?  Because I see nothing wrong with using
this group at least partly for us all to just get to know each other, rather
than spending all our time addressing specific questions.)
Also, I would again pose the question (to all readers, not just to Greg):
Why are you so desperate?  There are probably plenty of nice MOTOS's
available.  Analyze yourself.  Be honest (brutally honest at times) with
yourself.  Find out what feelings (or actually, what erroneous beliefs about
yourself) are keeping you from going out and making friends with those
MOTOS's.  Decide to stop believing those erroneous beliefs; recognize them
for the destructive lies that they are, and change your mind.  The cause for
your desperation is not that your body and emotions have not received what
they desire.  The ultimate cause is that you have (for whatever reason) not
believed it possible for them to receive what they desire.
Another example of this, which I have just realized, faced, and dealt with,
and which I also offer in the hope that it might help some other readers:
I felt that I was not really a man.  Oh, of course I have the appropriate
physical characteristics; but I felt that I wasn't really a man INSIDE.  I camefrom a background not calculated to make one grow up feeling strongly male: my
parents divorced when I was 8; and my mother, who got custody of me, was (or
at least I perceived her as) domineering.  I've just been reading a book
(""Eros Defiled"", by John White) in which it is mentioned that those who grow
up in such backgrounds may become what is known as ""pseudohomosexuals"" --
i.e. men who may have some characteristics of homosexuals and/or lack some of
the characteristics of normal heterosexuals, who are more likely to have
homosexual feelings and be vulnerable to homosexual temptation than most
males, but who are not practicing homosexuals.	I certainly ended up this way;
I've never had a homosexual experience, but I've sometimes wanted males all
too strongly.  Anyway, the neat turnaround in my case was that my desire for a
really good woman as friend and lover -- the desire around which all my
frustration had been built -- came to my aid!  I realized that there is one
young woman I know whom I have been attracted to and cared about for some
months, not because she is a generic woman (I know, there's no such thing)
who could heal my ""disease"" and cure my problems, but because she is a good
companion, being an intelligent, sensitive, talented, and beautiful woman.
(And to top it off, I'm not sure if she believes that she's attractive!  So I
have some compassion for her too.)  In other words, realizing that I had a
desire which was a normal male desire, not based on sickness and pain, enabled
me to know that yes, I too am a real man!  [Then why do I like quiche? :-)]
BTW, the young lady involved has some inkling of how I feel; perhaps when we
meet for dinner and conversation next week [SURPRISE! Jeff got a date! :-)]
I will have an opportunity to progress....

Oh my god!  nobody has taken that one up yet!  Jeff Please!! I'd like to
suggest that you really apply the counsels you give us to yourself, especially
the ones about not accepting those erroneous beliefs and realising how dangerous
they are.  Why in the world do you have to equate homosexual feelings with
""not being a man""?  (what is a ""man"" anyway?) why are your desires for women
""normal"" and your desires for men ""based on sickness and pain""?  Has your God
really told you that some of those of those desires are bad and the others good?
Are you sure that you haven't been fooled by people rather than God into
believing such things?  people have said many things in the name of God to
suit their own little purposes and not necessarily for the good of others.  As
you seem to be in very close contact with your God, you should really make sure
that he REALLY disproves of those homosexual feelings you have before you
reject them as ""sick"" and throw yourself at women instead because you think it
is the ""right"" thing to do (I am wildly paraphrasing you here, and could be
completely wrong in my interpretation of your words).  If your God is a god of
Love as you say he is, he might accept many different types of Love, and if he
doesn't why doesn't he?  you should also ask him that. 
Your words make it sound as though you are interested in relationships with
women only so that they can ""save"" you from your desires for men.  If that is
so, that doesn't sound very good for the woman you will have a relationship with
Shouldn't she deserve to be loved for who she is rather than because she is
""saving"" you from other people you love?  And if you love other people and they
also love you, wouldn't you all be more happy just loving each other rather
than trying to pretend you don't?  This sounds like I am pushing you to lead a
homosexual life; yes and no, I think you should just make sure that you are
not interested in heterosexual relationships just to avoid homosexual relation-
ships, and if you are, then maybe reconsider your choice.  I am not alone in
thinking that it is possible to be both a Christian and homosexual (I can look
up some references for you if you are interested).
Go in peace.

ever posted to this group, and Sophie Quigley rakes me over the coals!
> Why in the world do you have to equate homosexual feelings with ""not being a

I never made such an equation.	I indicated that the homosexual feelings were
a CONSEQUENCE of feeling ""not really a man"".  What is a ""man""?	Come on, this
is abnormal psych we're talking; it doesn't have to make sense! :-)
Seriously, I'm not 100% sure; but I think part of the problem is that, having
been born in 1955, I was too much imbued with the idea that one had to be
macho in order to be male.  I was a whiz kid, 2 years ahead of my ""normal""
grade in school, still beating most of the other kids academically (and the
same height as most of my classmates, or things would have been worse), but
still 2 years behind them in development of strength and coordination.	Thus I
was no athlete -- and the mid-60's were still a relatively unenlightened era,
when society ""required"" males to be athletic.  Also, for most of my life, I
had no full-time male role model (remember, my parents divorced when I was 8).
Thus I had no one from whom to learn how a man acts around other people (of
either sex.
I think these were the two main reasons why I didn't feel myself to be a
man.  The fact that the first one is based on a false premise did not prevent
me from believing it; remember that the macho ideal thoroughly imbued the
society of that era (including the other boys in school, who lost no chance to
put me down), and so this belief in my own unmanliness was probably fixed by
the time I was 10 -- well before my critical faculties had reached any
significant level of maturity.
> why are your desires for women
> ""normal"" and your desires for men ""based on sickness and pain""?
I wasn't spouting doctrine.  I was giving experiential evidence; i.e. the past
times when I have been really bummed out have generally been the times when my
homosexual desires have been strongest.  When I was feeling reasonably good
about myself and the world, my homosexual desires submerged; in fact,
especially in the last year or two, I actually did date women a few times
(i.e. my rendezvous earlier this evening was not the first in a century).
Thus it's not a question of ""why"" heterosexuality is normal, and homosexuality
not; based on my experience (and on some case histories I've read), they just
ARE that way.

Let us put it this way:  Based solely on my ""close contact"", I consider it
certain that He much prefers heterosexuality to homosexuality.	(I won't
even mention the many Biblical utterances against homosexuality.)  I don't go
for women because I think it's ""right"".  I do it because that's what I really
want to do; women are great people, with (in general) certain qualities of
warmth and tenderness which I just can't get even from my closest male
friends -- and I'm not talking about sex, I'm talking about the persons
inside the bodies.

I do not deny that genuine love -- i.e. love which naturally expresses itself
in truly caring for the other person's needs, helping to bring them joy and
soothe their hurts -- can exist in homosexual relationships.  This would only
make sense; I'm well aware that members of any type of couple, straight or
gay, not only can but ought to be good friends if the relationship is going to
really satisfy either person (again, more than the body).  But it is my thesis
(not based on extensive research, but plausible from what I've read) that a
gay relationship doesn't quite satisfy, but is rather chosen as an ersatz
substitute for the wonder of knowing and being known by -- and loving and
being loved by -- a motOs, someone so different from you that probably even
after many years together, you still won't understand all the ways in which
that person's mind works differently from yours.

I guess this shoots the thesis which one frequent net.singles contributor
told me in a letter: that I'm good at expressing myself in words.  I grant
that this was a subtle point.  But I thought that what I said was that I
realized that I DO desire/love/whatever this young lady for what she is, and
that it was this realization that enabled me to know that I am truly a man
(since I have a desire such as any healthy, normal man might have), and thus
in one swell foop [sic] pretty well get rid of the homosexuality.
> And if you love other people and they also love you, wouldn't you all be
> more happy just loving each other rather than trying to pretend you don't?
Yes.  But this is not the case.  My homosexual desires, as I indicated, have
arisen when I was really in poor psychological shape; thus it's hard to class
them as ""love"" -- more as desperate need.  Anyway, most of the homosexuals of
my (casual) acquaintance seem to have a marked streak of rottenness not far
from the (usually) pleasant surface; this is not a streak of meanness or
nastiness, but rather what seems (to my casually but observantly acquainted
eye) to be self-loathing; this is not attractive.  Finally...the most powerful
homosexual desire I ever felt was when I was 27; the object of it was hardly
over half my age.  Surely you would not wish me to be pederastic?  No sense in
having a nice kid pay for my problems.
> I am not alone in thinking that it is possible to be both a Christian and
> homosexual (I can look up some references for you if you are interested).
I half agree with this.  Certainly homosexuals can become Christians.  But I
do not believe that a choice to continue in homosexuality is consistent with
Christianity.  On the other hand [we have five fingers and a thumb :-)], it
is possible that God might not remove one's homosexual desires immediately
after one becomes a Christian, or even immediately after one asks for help
from God in dealing with them.	There may be other areas of you that God
thinks need work even more than your sexuality.  But those who deliberately
continue in their homosexuality -- claiming it to be a perfectly good,
normal expression of love -- ""glory in their shame"".
I am aware of one book that has popped up on the net before, and recently
(""Christianity, Homosexuality, and Social Tolerance""), but I have not had a
chance to read it yet.
Everyone:  Did my previous article really so fail to express my true meaning
that any other intelligent person would have interpreted it as Sophie did?

I think some site upstream of us must zap most of net.motss, because rarely
do I see articles in it; most of the things I do see are, to speak frankly,
boring.
I grant (responding to a paragraph not quoted here) that I've never gotten to
be really close friends with any of the gays I know.  (For one thing, most of
them smoke, which I detest.)  Thus I don't know how they came to be as they
are.  Plus, as I implied in my previous article, most of the gays I know have
pleasant personalities and considerable talent (my acquaintance with them is
through local theatre); the self-dislike (perhaps loathing was too strong a
term) is not immediately obvious; but it seems to be there underneath the
surface in most cases.
I can only repeat what I said -- that when I felt worst about myself, my
homosexual feelings became strongest; and when I felt better, more optimistic,
about myself, my heterosexual feelings resurfaced; and the cause and effect
were in the order listed (i.e. feeling rotten CAUSED the homosexual feelings.)
Based on this and on the previous paragraph, I'm not looking for new gay
friends, and not even very much for new male friends -- not because of
homophobia, but because I'm much more interested in women, and I think it
would help me grow as a person to take the risk of becoming closer friends
with one or more women, rather than with men.  Most of my close friends for
most of my life have been male; there's nothing wrong with having male (or,
generically, same-sex) friends (it's infinitely better than having no friends
-- men are people too!); but I agree with the saying ""Vive la difference!"" --
women's personalities have some nifty good qualities that aren't there in men
(and, apparently, vice versa, since there are numerous heterosexual women),
and one whose closest relationship(s) is (are) with MOTSS's is really missing
out on some good stuff.
Basically, my question is:  Why be gay, when there's so much more joy,
interest, and wonder in being straight?  (No flames please; this is a
serious question; if the discussion gets too heavy, it can move to net.motss.)

Well, from the perspective of some of MY gay friends, the
answer is ""why not?""  Actually, those who would answer that way
are more bisexual than exclusively homosexual; their feeling is
that you shouldn't cut yourself off from the possibility of
loving and being loved by someone of your own sex.  Rationale
for this includes believing that someone of the same sex can
share more of your feelings, since you have more in common.
(After hearing this a lot from close friends, I've begun to
feel narrow-minded for being straight!)
I've always had a sneaking suspicion that I might be open
to a relationship with an MOTSS if I felt better about myself.
The differences in men are enough to distract me every time. . .
Vive, as it has been said, la difference!

This is all fine - but taken by itself (yes, I know Jeff had more to say),
it suggests to me not at all that there's something wrong with
homosexuality.  Rather, it suggests that Jeff is probably, deep down, a
thoroughgoing heterosexual!  (Sorry, Jeff, I had to say it.)  That being

In other words, if the idea of homosexuality turns you off, don't do it.
Jeff ought to be a little more careful with analyses of causality.
Correlation, even with proper time sequence, does not imply causality (and

I have a similar reaction to Wendy's.  It seems like, logically, a person 
has been given all these nerve endings designed to feel good with proper
treatment.  I don't believe in the 'Pursuit of stimulation as the end
all and be all' but if you have someone of either sex who you care about
in very deeply, and feel very special toward, their gender shouldn't matter 
if you want to share that caring in a special way.  And, as the above states,
they may be able to share even more, do to the gender similarities.
Note that I, too, still remain purely heterosexual, and can't imagine
changing, or even switching occasionally despite the above logic.  I
may just be a product of our society (witness the ancient Greeks),
but I cannot overcome it with the realization.  The stigma may be too 
much.  I do not condemn or condone others who choose otherwise. 
Judging from my two informants above, and others, I wonder if women are 
more able to share such feeling in such a way?  Maybe society allows women 
to be more expressive of their feelings, and this is one way to share.

De gustibus.  But my point was that gay people cannot be characterized as

All that one should be willing to allow is that those few gay people with
whom you've made acquaintance aren't your kind of people.  I can't argue
with your particular experience, but I do resent it when you generalize
from that about all of us as a class when your experience is so admittedly
shallow. 
One could also say ""smokers have pleasant personalities and considerable
talent"" or ""theatre people demonstrate self-dislike"", but one wouldn't,
because it would sound silly.  Get my point?

Like most of what Jeff says, we're operating with a value judgement made
before the fact, and his reality is made to fit that world view.  I'm sure you
could hear some other extremist saying ""one can get so much closer to MOTSS
than MOTOS--there is so much more in common to be shared.""  Both statements
bore me, because they have so little to do with anyone's personal experience--
they are primarily political statements.  I'd leave this evaluation up to each
individual, for we cannot decide for them.
	>Basically, my question is:  Why be gay, when there's so much more joy,

Usually, there isn't any choice, and the bit about ""more joy, interest and
wonder"" is not predetermined for people of any persuasion.  There's only one
variant of this which I would accept: ""Why be gay, when it's so much EASIER
being straight in Western societies?""  Of course, there's no answer to this--
people are what they are.  For people who find themselves attracted to both
sexes, there may be more of an element of ""choice""--they can decide to
concentrate on one sex for simplicity or scruples, or as Woody Allen puts it,
they can double their chances of a date on Saturday night.

You're both right.
Whether one expresses affection sexually or not, and when one does, is purely
a matter of individual orientation.  The comment should have been stated
""...you shouldn't cut yourself off from the possibility of expressing
affection sexually with someone of your own sex.""  Whether this is true or
not is a different story; sexual interest and love are two different things,
and don't always go hand-in-hand.  Some people don't get interested in their
own sex; some people don't get interested in the opposite sex; some people
don't get interested in either sex; some people (of *both* sexes) only get
interested in dumb blondes; and so forth.
I've seen nothing that indicates to me that anybody's figured out *why* some
people get interested only in the opposite sex/same sex/dumb blondes/etc..
There have been, however, a lot of ""explanations"" of why heterosexuality,
homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality, etc. are ""better""; they all come across
as after-the-fact rationalizations.  The human personality is the product
of a lot of complicated biological, cultural/social, and personal factors.
Beware of ascribing a part of your personality to a small number of those
factors.  Just be what you are, and learn not to worry about it.  Learning
that can be hard, given the number of images we're flooded with about what
we're ""supposed"" to be; if we aren't what we think we ought to be, we worry
about it.  For some things, this is good; if we worry enough about breaking
little sister's/brother's toys, maybe we'll stop doing it and little sister/
brother will be happier.  Unfortunately, it also makes us guilty about things
which shouldn't have any guilt associated with them, such as sexual orientation.
All the tools of social indoctrination can be used by a dominant group to
inculcate their attitudes, even if the only benefit of those attitudes
accrues to the dominant group.  I'm sure most gays reading this group can
testify to that.  So can blacks other minorities, and so can women.
If you feel heterosexual, don't worry about it and don't feel any need
to defend it.  The only way to defend it, except as a personal orientation,
is to find fault with other orientations, and such fault simply doesn't exist.
A particular person may be gay and unhappy, and may even be unhappy because
of their gayness.  But that's just that one person; and even for that person,
the unhappiness may come about because of the image that it's ""unnatural""
and wrong, not because it isn't right for them.  (John Varley's ""Demon"" has
an interesting bit about a woman who grew up in a lesbian separatist society
and discovered, relatively late in life, that she was ""queer"" - i.e., straight.
She felt quite guilty about it, and had a lot of trouble dealing with it.)

Which is the chicken and which is the egg is kind of irrelevant here.  It is
*you* who makes the association between depression and homosexuality.  The
paragraph was not intended to be ""anti-religious"" at all (though you have
tended to see anything that differs with your point of view as being attacking
or anti-religious; all we are all trying to do is provide some personal
insights; isn't that what you wanted when you originally submitted an article?)
Admittedly, the word ""baggage"" could be misinterpreted, but it was meant to
have a neutral connotation; i.e., believing that something is ""sinful"", a
listed sin in the book of sins, means more to you than just ""it is wrong to
do""; it implies lowered self-worth for committing the act, potential divine
punishment, etc.; it is these things that the word ""sinful"" CARRIES with it
that I referred to as ""baggage"".)  The point is:  whether you get homosexual
feelings and get depressed, or you get depressed and feel that homosexual
feelings are somehow appropriate because of your imagined lower self-worth, due
to presumptions about what homosexual feelings MUST mean, it is *you* who have
made that association.

If I show you a book that said that belief in a deity was an aberration and a
psychosomatic disease, would you believe it?  Would you care?  I didn't think
so.  So why suddenly base your life on some other book?  Don't read a book and
believe in it to justify or legitimize your existence.  (And I'm not talking
about you-know-which-book, either!)  The notion of different sexual lifestyles
being ""aberrations"", ""abnormal"", or whatever has largely been disbanded.  One
might as well write a book labelling my tastes in music or food as
psychological disorders.  (""Mr. X is a chocophile, an cuisinial pervert who

Actually, the current consensus is that everyone has the *potential* for
attraction to members of *either* sex, especially since we all have what are
described as male and female components within us (except for those people who
are ""all man"", of course :-).  Whatever one's sexual ""orientation"", it is made
out of choice.  (Those who tell you otherwise are simply evading responsibility
for making that choice.)  Again, calling attraction to members of the same sex
""severe internal damage"" is just like saying that people who hold different
religious beliefs from you have some sort of mental problem.  The idea is not
to ""help"" other people who are different from you to become more like you, but
rather for YOU to get the healing that would enable you to accept differences
in people as wonderful things instead of something to be eliminated.  Assuming
that anyone wants to be just like you (having a desire for a MOTOS, despairing
or otherwise; believing any similar belief) is equally self-damaging.  It would
seem that some of your statements have evoked harsh response from some gay
people on the net.  I hope you understand that your referring to people as
damaged or flawed psychologically is equivalent to someone saying that you
should be committed for having religious beliefs, and I hope that that
understanding helps you gain more insight into both the global and personal
issues we've discussed.  Some of the responses to you have been on the harsh
side, but realize the harshness that your statements we're perceived to have.
(See, gay people stereotype and generalize just like you do :-)  One is
reminded of Shylock's speech from ""Merchant of Venice"".

Let's get picky here. If we want to talk about perversion of the sexual
drive, ANY sex that is not based on reproduction is a perversion of the
intent of its existence. If you look into the field studies of animal
behavior (such as Goodall and the primates) you will find that
homosexuality exists throughout the animal kingdom. 
I think we are forgetting that there are different forms of being gay.
There is a 'natural' form where the person happens to be gay, happens to be
happy, and happens to enjoy it. There is also a 'clinical' form of gay
which is caused by someone's sexuality being so screwed up that they don't
know what is happening. These are the ones that need help and guidance
because they aren't really gay, they're just mixed up. By trying to lump
these two (very disparate) groups together we do both a disservice.

>Since the original nature of a basic impulse is superceded, the phenomenon

You are lumping the two groups again. In the case of the natural gay it
isn't deviant, it is a lifestyle. In the case of the others it needs to be
treated as a symptom just like the others. The problem gays have had in
society is that us 'normal' people tend to lump them all in the clinical
category simply because we don't think (or feel) like they do.

Perhaps horrified that this person dredged up tired, old stereotypes without
basis in reality to back up his own fears and preconceptions?  Amazed that
in the same breath he says that he doesn't have any Christians as close
friends, yet still feels free to generalize about them?
Am I hitting you over the head enough?  How does one properly react to such

Which instinct is that?  Human beings are certainly sexual creatures, by
nature, but it seems that people *learn* to focus those feelings, i.e.,
to associate the sexual drive exclusively with one particular act.
People are always talking about what's 'natural'.  What is natural?  Have
you looked at other cultures?  Is this 'basic human instinct' you speak
of universal?  (What is that you say?  It is universal, except in those
places where it's been perverted?  :-)
What about other sexual acts -- oral sex, masturbation, etc.?  Are these
also perversions of a basic human instinct?  Why pick on homosexuality?

""Intent""?  Are you turning into a theist?  [1/2 :-)]
Anyway, I could argue that -- in humans at least -- the primary reason for
sex is to bring the partners closer together as humans (people do need to be
touched, and that's about as touching as two people can be; plus of course
there is [I assume] a tremendous emotional and even spiritual closeness).
That new life should arise out of this immense love, and be brought into such
a loving environment, is a natural and beautiful potential consequence; but I
don't consider it the primary purpose.  After all, in the course of a
lifelong marriage, a couple would probably have intercourse thousands of
times, but only a very small percentage of those times would be with the
intention of conception; the rest would be for the fun and joy and communion
of it.

One could say the same for ""straight"" and herpes.  And both would
be equally silly.  Neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality in
and of themselves promote any disease, physical or mental.  Some
people do get sick, but most people smart enough to use a computer
understand that infectious disease comes from germs, not sin.

First we assign a bit to sex...
Then  we assign a bit to gender...
Then  we assign a bit to preferred gender of partner...
Then  we assign a bit to preferred sex    of partner...
Now then...If your sex is the same as your gender, and your partner's sex is
the same as your partner's gender, and your sex is opposite your partner's, then
you are straight (praise the lord :-)
But, If your sex is the same as your gender, and your partner's sex is
the same as your partner's gender, and your sex is the same as your partner's,
then you are gay (praise the devil :-)
However, If your sex is the same as your partner's gender, and your partner's
sex is the same as your gender, and your sex is not the same as your gender,
then, what if two hermaphrodites were partners...de ja vu...
The point I'm trying to make is this...
There are two kinds of people in the world,
Those who relate to people,
And those who divide people into different kinds of people before they decide
how they are *supposed* to (not) relate to that person based on whether or not
that person can be properly squashed into the stereotype against which they
are being measured.

Jeff, please don't make the assumption that because I do not admit to a

non- or a- theistic. If the truth be known, Zen Druids are polytheistic.

me, and that includes the writings of Jesus as well as others such as Lao
Tze and Budda. But please, this isn't net.religion (Thank God... :->)

I disagree, to a point. Relying on sex for closeness and intimacy is a good
way to doom a relationship. There are many other ways to share closeness,
and to put too much emphasis on this single act creates an imbalanced
situation. You can be at least as close (or closer) with someone without
going to bed with them if you want and be just as satisfied with the
result. And it isn't nearly as messy.

I didn't say one had to RELY on sex for closeness.  I just indicated that it
did involve a tremendous degree of closeness.  It also involves a tremendous
degree of giving of oneself; such a degree that, though I would very likely
become sexually aroused from cuddling with an attractive woman (even if
neither party explored the other's erogeneous zones), I would be hesitant to
go to bed with her unless I was already very close to her in more ways than
the physical.  It will be interesting to see what happens if/when some nice,
attractive woman and I do become very close...will we be able to restrain
ourselves?

involve both ecstasy and mess?

First, from what I read about the real world, many people DO rely on sex
for closeness. Foolish mortals, they don't know what they are missing. As
to sex involving a tremendous degree of closeness or giving of oneself, it
CAN, but it doesn't neccessarily have to. I think it depends on what we
define our terms as. I find it hard to believe that one night stands
involve significant amounts of giving of oneself or sharing. They are
mostly exercises (*pun somewhat intended*) in reminding you that you should
have changed your sheets. Personal comment time: I AM sexually aroused by
cuddling with women (I'll leave off the word attractive for now-- beauty is
very much in the eye of the beholder and I'm sure I'd be misinterpreted
otherwise. Let's just say that anyone I'm willing to cuddle with is
attractive to me regardless of what the rest of the world believes. of
course, when have I listened to the rest of the world???). If you haven't
tried it, Jeff, I can't recommend it highly enough... Just because I am
aroused doesn't mean it gets any further simply because I've found that the
easiest way to create unwelcome/subconcious committments is to go to bed
with someone. I'll save that for the people that mean something to me.
>It will be interesting to see what happens if/when some nice,
>attractive woman and I do become very close...will we be able to restrain
>ourselves?
Of course not. Men are animals. All they think about is sex, sex, sex. You
are a man, at least from what I've heard, therefore you'll go rutting off
like a mule in heat. Fortunately, Plaid Warlocks are immune from those kind
of problems. I've also got this nice bridge for sale....
>Chuq, it might be interesting if you elaborated on your sentence beginning
>""You can be at least as close....""
Hmmm.... This is, shall we say, a loaded question. I find many
situations where delving into the baser aspects of sex interrupt the
general flow of the situation. One of the better (but quickly failing)
secrets of my life is that I love to give massage (if I were flexible
enough I'd probably never leave my cave... *sigh*). There are any
number of people, some on the net, some off the net, who could give
first hand appraisals of this. I'm not about to mention names because I
also firmly believe in discretion (I have every intention of living to
a ripe old age... I'd love to die at the age of 90 in the hands of a
jealous husband, but I don't get involved with married women). While
massage can be an extremely sensual hobby it also tends to be quite relaxing.
I find it a great complement to myself when I can take someone who is
tense and stiff as a board and put them to sleep. Sex tends to be
contraindicated under these circumstances. I also run into situations where
I am interacting with a person at a very intense level and the physical
coordination required for sex tends to throw everything out of sync. One of
the more sensual evenings I've had in the last while was when a young lady
of my aquaintance came over for the evening, helped me polish off a bottle
of wine, lit my oil lamp, and we preceded to take off our clothes and tell
knock knock jokes all night. That wasn't the original intention, mind you,
but we enjoyed ourselves so thoroughly that we decided not to take a chance
of ruining the mood. That might sound strange, but you should have been
there (hmm... given half a chance, maybe you might next time... *snicker*)
>Sigh....  I guess one must take the bad with the good; why did sex have to
>involve both ecstasy and mess?
Messes are why they invented washing machines. If it really bothers you,
try a jacuzzi or a shower. Good clean fun. One of these days you'll find
out that given the proper circumstances you never even notice the mess.. At
least not until you roll over into it in the middle of the night. *snicker*
(Gack... Wierd moods are wonderful, but I bet I regret this article in the
morning.... I can just see thousands of women pounding at my door screaming
for massages.... Actually, I'd settle for one or two... *snicker* {note:
I'm going to HAVE to patch this software to keep me from posting when I'm

pro-creation.  i do agree that that is one function for them (and a
very important one at that), but you're overlooking the unity factor; i
believe that the pleasure resulting from the sexual union and relationship
in general binds people together.  moses says in genesis that men and
women were set apart to be married, and that the two would cleave to
become one flesh -- the idea implies that a man and a woman sharing
one life should share all things (including their bodies).
as an evangelical Christian, i do believe that there is something wrong
about homosexuality -- i know i'll probably catch some heat for that, but
the Bible is fairly clear about it (the few times that it is mentioned).
this has been a difficult topic for me to deal with, since i have some
homosexual friends, and it is difficult for me to call it sin.  on the
other hand, where God is clear, i need to be clear too.  don't get me
wrong -- i don't hold out homosexuality as a more grave sin than any of
my own sins -- lust, pride, impatience.  but sin is still sin.
frankly, i don't appreciate the disparaging remarks about homosexuals.
i don't appreciate those kinds of remarks about all people.  Jesus died
for them just as much as He died for you and me.  we need to recognize
sin where we see it, but we also need to be moving forward in an attitude
of love.  Jesus didn't go around calling people perverts to put them down;
He came to give us new life, to show us that we didn't have to be satisfied
with our sinful nature, to forgive us, and to bring us into a relationship
with God.  To call other people perverts (while implying that you're okay)
is ridiculous.  it reminds me of the parable of the pharisee and the 
publican, where the pharisee is praying to himself (not God) about what
a great guy he is, while the other man asks for mercy; the publican went
home justified, while the pharisee did not.  the Lord wants us to 
recognize who we are in His sight, and if we believe that we are good
enough for God, then we have a wrong view of who we are in His sight.
Jesus said, ""Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.  Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.""
we need to realize that we are poor in spirit -- telling other people
what ""perverts"" they are doesn't seem to recognize our own poorness of
spirit.  do we mourn our own sinfulness, even as Christians?  we need
to.  i'm not trying to water it down -- as i said before, sin is still
sin.  but i suggest that we work on taking the log out of our own eyes
before we work on the speck in someone else's.

How about treating people like people?  Should people who have been sterilized

they not fit to teach, be parents, and hold positions which require security
clearances?  Not being able to procreate directly within a relationship does
not automatically make those people unfit for anything other than procreation.
Why should it matter what they do in the privacy of their own homes? 
Gay people generally are not seducing children, raping women, or killing
people.  Neither are blacks, Jews, women, Englishmen, rich folks, or any
other subdivision of society other than rapists, child molesters, and
murderers.  Yes, there are some people in all of those categories who will

Bad assumption on a number of levels. It is possible for homosexuals to
have children, and growing numbers are. Artificial insemination is one
possibility. In a few years parthenogenisis will be a possibility as well.
If the fate of civilisation is involved, I'm sure you'll even find a few
hardy women who can overcome their revulsion with the male body and do it
for humanity. Besides, making the assumption that everyone is gay is like
making the assumption that everyone isn't. Silly, silly, silly. If you put
25 programmers in a room you will get 30 different opinions on a subject.
Why should it be different with sex?
>The Creator gave you genitals for one reason
>only that being to procreate. The pleasure that we connect with this primal act

Hmmm... that isn't where I notice the pleasure but that's beside the point.
If the Creator (what a nice amorphous way of pointing out that the reason
you are so any-gay is because your God told you to be-- so much for
thinking for yourself) really wanted Sex (with a capital S, thank God) to
be simply for procreation then It would have kept us amoeba's because we
wouldn't have to worry about things like partners. Sex is a much more
complicated subject than that. Anthropological studies have shown that the
reason the sex is fun is directly linked to the intelligence of man. Lower
animals have sex only during times of ovulation. Lower animals also tend to
be polygamous and the young tend to be born quickly and become independent
quickly. Humans (and to a lesser extent our brothers the primates) take a
lot longer to mature and the woman is less able to fend for both herself
and her sibling. To survive the latter months of pregnancy and the early
months of the child they invented recreational sex. This new and improved
feature allows the woman to keep a man from wandering so that he will be
more willing to take care of her.

bullshit. They have always been around. Many famous names in history were
gay and acknowledge as such. Look for biographical works that haven't been
rewritten by the puritanical elite.

See my previous comments on gay childrearing. If it takes too many liberals
in office for too many years to allow people to live their lives the way
they want to without fear (or excessive fear considering the current
situation) of retribution then I'm for it. Harrasing Gays for being gay is
no better than what happened to the 'witches' in Salem in the 1600's. The
only difference is that Salem used physical torture and the current crop of
bigots is limited to psychological torture.

People who automatically write off an entire (and non-trivial) section of
the population based on a biased and incorrect stereotype (this, my
friends, is called bigotry whether is is Nazism and Jews, Rednecks and
Blacks, or assholes and gays) are the people with the real problem. If you
can't look past the walls and see the people, you really don't know what it
means to live. Forcing people to conform to your internal stereotypes may
make your life a little more stable, but it also makes it a lot less real.

Yes, it HAS occurred to us progessive, right-thinking types (since the
References line on this article points back to an article of mine I think
he was referring to me. As such, I shall endeavor to answer for myself). I
happen to be human. Part of being human is being imperfect. I will gladly
admit that I am bigotted and biased because I don't think any person can
free themselves of this. It is simply too large a part of our social
heritage. Unfortunately. I'm even willing to admit some of my biases:
people who don't shower, people who don't think, people who don't like
people for what they are, and people who insist on viewing human beings as
little tiny things that can be shoved in a convenient box somewhere and
typecast. These are all bigotries and biases, but I think they are MUCH
healthier than the bigotries of people who don't like jews or gays or plaid
warlocks. They are certainly less harmful to other people.

I have an inordinate amount of tolerance for many things, including
tolerance for people that don't take showers. As recent comments have
shown, one thing I DON'T have tolerance for is when the bigotry or lack of
tolerance causes problems for other people. Life is difficult enough for
all of us-- we don't need to run around making excuses to make other
people's lives worse. I try very hard to make myself and the people around
me happy. I won't stand around and watch incosiderate bigoted assholes tear
that down. My apologies to the net for drawing this argument out instead of
letting it die and rot in hell where it belongs, but Chuqui happens to be
pissed (an exceptionally rare event, thankfully) and he is not going to let
the assholes ruin someone's life.

My thesis was not that all gays are normal, contributive or well adjusted.
My thesis was that gays are just like the rest of us! Some are normal,
contribiutive, and well adjusted. Some are screwed up in the head. Some are
simply unsure of themselves. The same can be said for any group of people
larger than about 10, regardless of sexual preferences, religious beliefs,
color of hair, skin, eyelashes, whether they snore at night, drool at
breakfast, pick their noses, brush their teeth, or eat raw squid. We are
ALL human, dammit. The thing that pisses me off about all of this is there
is an undercurrent in bigotry that says 'You are different from me, therefore
you are less human than I am'. The thing that makes us human is our
difference, denying that denies the very essence that makes us what we are,
and that is the greatest sin that any man could make.

I don't remember reading anything which would claim that gay people have an
edge on humanity or tolerance--perhaps you'd like to point out the article.
The whole point of the ""right-thinkers"" in this discussion is to show
that sexual attraction to members of one's own sex HAS NO BEARING on the
well-roundedness and maturity of individuals nor on their efficacy as
successful members of their society (save for the discrimination which they
encounter.) There are screwed up gay people, there are screwed up straight
people--the *problem* is that many people use homosexuality as a discriminant
to justify their own attitudes without any real evidence.  This is a disservice
to the people being discriminated against, not to mention all of society.
As for ""tolerance"", I do not agree that those who took exception to Jeff's
or, more seriously, harpo!jrl's article were guilty of intolerance.
There are ways to take exception to ideas posted here without spraying
hate and invective as we saw in the harpo!jrl article.  I think that we
can reliably say that that article was inappropriately phrased, even
as the sentiments were genuine.  To be ""tolerant"" does not mean to
lack critical judgement.
Examine for a minute the article by harpo!jrl.  What is the point that it
is trying to make?  Do you detect a difference between the sentiments:
""gays should remain in the closet forever; discrimination is deserved;
gays are fundamentally imperfect"" and ""I can't accept homosexuality as
a valid lifestyle.""  The first represents the facist imposition of a personal
morality upon all members of society as well as a empirically unjustified
claim, the second, merely a statement of personal belief.  One really
cannot take excessive exception to the latter, though it is often worthwhile
trying to express one's own views to let that person know where you stand.
With some luck, they might even understand you!

Well, maybe SOME of us have large brains...and maybe some of us even use

Homosexuality exists in many species, not just humans.  It cycles in and
out of acceptability (and correspondingly, in and out of visibility).  Gee,
either harpo!jrl doesn't know more than 20 or 30 years of history (if that
much) or I got caught in a time warp thinking that ancient Greece was a few
millenia back.  (Check out Aristophanes.)

It's a wonder that this wasn't cross-listed to net.politics, net.flame,
net.motss,...  When harpo!jrl can tell cause from effect from irrelevant
opinion; when he can tell a liberal from a conservative; when he can
distinguish love, sex, and procreation; when he can show at least minimal
respect for others then I might be willing to consider accepting him as a
human.  For now, I'll recognize him as (allegedly) Homo sapiens, but that's
about it.

You're probably right; the rest of the net -- or you, at least -- isn't

Hence the conclusion follows that homosexuality is BAD.  Some other

	Enormous families are VERY GOOD, especially if you can draw on the

Put it this way:  I suppose I had mixed motives.  On the one hand, I think
we'll end up agreeing to disagree about the sources of homosexuality; coming
from a Christian viewpoint, I believe that God planned for union between a man
and a woman, and that anything else is outside His plans and hence suboptimal;
I still think there's something in a gay that makes homosexuality falsely SEEM
optimal; I'll leave it to my gay readers to figure out for themselves what
that may be in their cases, but I was hoping to at least provoke some self-
examination to help some gay toward the refreshing niftiness and healthiness
of heterosexuality; I really hoped I could be of some help.  On the other
hand, I am, alas, not free of either pride or envy: pride, that I have not
become a practicing homosexual (and thus a somewhat patronizing attitude
toward those who have); envy, that these people have at least found an SO of
some sort.  Neither the good motives nor the bad held total sway.

I've been trying to catch up on both real work and net articles, and it does

some sort of inatimate objects.  In addition when weighing the
relative merits of homo sexuality versus hetero sexuality with
respect to evolution, I think the point is moot.  Evolution occurs
over generations.  The next generation comes to exist via a
a process that is about as hetero sexual as you can get!
(sounds rather clinical doesnt it)
Anyway, when it comes to genes, these little buggers are
supposed to be contained on chromosomes half of which come from
each partner in a decidedly hetero (again) encounter.  This
half each is what diversifies gene pools and allows the
evolutionary process to take place.
What does all this mean??
If homosexuality means anything to the human evolutionary process,
it's meaning is surely dwarfed when compared to heterosexuality.
Maybe this is obvious, but I thought I'd say it anyway

theories as to why homosexuality ""dies out"" in one generation.
""Kinship theory"", as mentioned earlier, is an attempt to explain
why certain behaviors are maintained in a gene pool even though
they seemingly work against their propagation.  In essence, an
organism does not have to reproduce in order to pass its genes
on to the next generation if its behavior increases the fitness
of its closely related relatives.  No one knows the causes of
homosexuality, and arguments as to its origin are as old as the
entire nature vs. nurture origin.  But kinship theory is a novel
(if somewhat far-fetched) application of sociobiological research
to human behavior.  If there is a ""gay gene"", it's carried
not only by gay people, but also by their parents and siblings.
So, given this theory, the gene survives regardless of whether
a gay individual has children.
You might argue, ""How does a gay person increase the fitness of his
relatives?""  It's hypothesized that this was expressed only very early
in human societies, with gay people acting in ""helper"" roles,
and the gene remains today simply because there are no negative pressures
on its survival.","BnHj32Qv_3sJ",12,1983-08-30,2,1

see that I have cause to put this in print, so to speak.
I have been approached by homo- and bi-sexual women on many occasions.
In most cases it was a friend who wanted to let me know of her interests
and find out if I felt anything similar.  I have never been one to deny
the bisexual in me (I believe it's in everyone) and there are certainly
women I find very attractive, but I'm decidedly hetero - and my reaction
is to feel extremely flattered.  I've had a few 'dinner dates' with
homosexuals and don't find any problems with it as long as I let my
tastes be known - people are people, and if she's someone I want to
spend dinner with, I'd love to, as long as I'm not 'leading her on'.
Why is everyone so paranoid?

yet, but the implications are there.
Except in the most simple cases, there is no 'one gene for this,
another for that'. it is usually taught like this by high school teachers
who either do not understand the matter or are simplifying the idea
in order to teach a principle.
Now, everybody HERE go and read ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins.
(apologies to those who read net.philosophy and net.flame who are hearing
this bit of proseletysing for the third time). It is truly one of the
great mind expanding books of the century, and it is designed at a lay

would like to take the wind out of the sails of those who say

they can go back to saying ""Homosexuality isn't right because I do
not like it"" or ""Homosexuality isn't right because human beings should
strive to be better than the animals"" (of couse then they have to state
their case as to why any sexual preference is better than another) or
""Homosexuality isn't right because it is sinful"" or SOMETHING other

definition of natural than I do, that statement is simply WRONG.

making moral judgments about gay men and women??  I'm tired of reading
statements here, which if applied to blacks, women or other minorities
would be deemed completely unacceptable and booted off the net by the
weight of public opinion.  Yet, here, we have someone who wants to lump
homosexuality with incest and ""illegitamite children"" (sic), not to mention
the scourge of premarital sex.  Well, if gays could marry, I suppose they'd
avoid that last one.  For the other two, remember that we're talking about
a ""victimless"" association between two consenting adults--incest and
illegitimate children clearly producing victims.  Gays don't have to justify
their existence through biology, sociology or psychology (though we can
attempt to find counter-arguments through any of these field, if pressed.)
METACOMMENT: It's unfortunate that the subject of homosexuality had to be
	     broached in such a way that was guaranteed to stir up the
	     worst fears of the great unwashed.  I found the discussion
	     fascinating, though as frequently disturbing as encouraging.
	     It would have been interesting to see how the discussion
	     had gone if a different question had been asked (though
	     what would it have been?)
