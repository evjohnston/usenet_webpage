        It is specious for another reason as well, it is *false*.
There is no significant excess brain capacity, it is all used for
*something*. Just because only ~5% is used for *consiousness* does not
mean the rest is without function.

This is an interesting topic to me, not for the evolution vs.
creationism aspect of it, but because we take it for granted that
intelligence is always a good thing, whereas it may not be.
By Werner's reasoning we ought to have two or three brains, just in
case.  (Why keep all the stuff in one place?)  I wonder if there aren't
cases where having all those extra nerves is just asking for trouble.
It would seem to me (naively) that nerve paths provide a sort of
interstate highway map for some kinds of viruses to follow, and the
richer a nervous system you have the more inroads they can find.  (I'm
thinking of herpesviruses; I had shingles about ten years ago.)
I seem to remember hearing about some research in which someone showed
that intelligence is selected against in rats.  Anybody know about
this?  (Some people will probably suggest it is also selected against
where my family comes from.)  There are certainly constraints against
brain size, e.g. an infant's brain at birth is limited in size by the
size of the birth canal.  Stephen Jay Gould says one reason why the
human baby is so helpless when born is that the human infant is a sort
of fetus that got out of the womb too early.  If it stayed in until it
was as developed as its mammalian counterparts it could not be born
without killing its mother.  Anyway, there is a price to be paid for
all this excess brain size.
As for the 5%-95% argument, I don't take it too seriously.  If somebody
came to me and said, `You're only using 5% of your brain, so let us
scoop out the other 95%,' I'd probably decline the offer.  I may be
only using 5%, but I want ALL of it.  (In fact, if you have any extra
lying around, please send it to me.)

   T.J. Palmer was an ignorant, but observant individual.  He lacked the
training necessary to truly understand and explain the results he got.
Fortunately for the world, Chiropractic schools no longer teach the Palmer
Philosophy.
   No competent chiropractor that I am aware of claims that chiropractic 
can or will cure *ANYTHING*, much less everything.  That bogus claim is
a direct result of the AMA deliberately using out-dated chiropractic
materials (from Palmer's time) in their smear campaigns.  Recall that
the AMA is the same group that opposed the licensing of, among others,
physchologists, dentists, podiatrists.  The AMA has lost any number of
law suits brought against it by the Chiropractors.  Many insurance 
companies (including quite a few state Worker's Compensation carriers)
actually prefer chiropractic treatment for patients with back injuries
(after screening by an orthopedist for breakage or other orthopedic
damage).  They achieve better results, faster, and for less money.
As I said in an earlier posting, compare the annual premiums paid by
MDs and DCs for malpractive insurance...this tells you something.
   IN late 1981, I suffered a severe compressive injury to my spine.  I
went to hospitals, and doctors galore.  Most of them did nothing, claiming
there was nothing wrong, and all that pain was ""in my imagination""  Cute.
I am *SO* glad that they took those AMA required courses in mind reading.
In any case, none of them were able to provide me with *ANY* relief.
After a few years of crippling chronic pain, and massive muscular spasms,
I reluctantly went to a chiropractor.  After 2-3 sessions, my level of
pain was down considerably, the muscle spasms, while still resent, were
not as bad, and I was somewhat more functional.  I also wasn't being doped 
out of my mind on muscle relaxers and pain killers.  (as a minor side
issue, I had no money or insurance at the time.  This chiropractor was
treating a friend, who had talked to him about me.  He insisted that I come
in for treatment.  He said that I would surely have more money someday,
but that treatment was essential.  He waited 3 years for that money, treatig
me the whole time.  Never complained about the money.  How many MDs would
do that?)
   Most chiropractors are honest, well trained healers, practicing a method
that is proven to provide relief, and is *SOME* cases has produced what
at least appear to be ""cures"".  Unfortunately, there are quacks in every
sector of the health care field.  The AMA just *LOVES* to publicize the
occasional quack chiropractor...too bad they don't put as much energy
into publicizing their own quacks when discovered.
   Modern chiropractic is not for everyone.  If you have a backache, or
a neck ache, or leg pains, and your MD can't do anything but provide you
with mind-dulling drugs that provide only minimal and temporary relief,
then you should consider seeing a chiropractor.  They *MAY* be able to
help.
   Don't fall victim to the money-grubbing power politics of the AMA.
Check the facts for yourself.  Remember that the AMA is the organization
that owns millions of $$$ in tobacco stock, and refused to support the
Surgeon General's warnings on cigarette packages.  According to studies
I have seen, the official AMA postions seldom represent the opinions
of the member MDs.  Often, according to these studies, they represent as
few as 5-10% of the membership.
   Doctors are human beings, not gods.  Western medical ""science"" has no
valid claim to being the only correct or effective means of achieving
health care.  When I need an MD, I see one.  When I need a chripractor, I
see one.

Let me start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of my SO. I myself have
never been to a chiropracter.
Last August, he (my SO) had excrutiating lower back pain and neck pain. A 
good night's rest had become impossible, his sinuses were frequently clogged
in the morning. He would also experience ""pounding"" (his word) headaches
that would come on in a flash. He works at Ft. Dix; the doctor there recommended
pain killers and compresses, and time off work. Well, Dave *hates* pills and
drugs, and couldn't afford ""time off work."" He works in an office, no heavy
physical labor, so he couldn't see what difference that would make. He went to
a chiropracter (one recommended to him) who took X-rays which showed vertabrae
in the neck and back that were *severely* out of kilter. Dave saw the X-rays
himself, was skeptical that it could be so bad, and actually paid for another
set through Ft. Dix just to make sure the chiro wasn't pulling a fast one.
Sure enough, same result.
He started going to the chiropracter three times a week for several months.
Each session would consist of spinal manipulation (back cracking). He felt
better after the first few weeks. Even during the height of fall pollen and
dry leaf season, he had NO stuffy noses in the morning. The headaches were
greatly reduced as well.
I live with my SO; I saw first-hand the day-to-day improvements. Up to that
point, I had harbored a vague distrust of chiros. Now I've seen one case where
a chiro was a definite help, and NO drugs were used. I should also mention that
periodically he was re-examined and subsequent X-rays were taken which did show
improvements in the out-of-line vertabrae. He is now down to one visit per 
month, and should be through after one or two more visits.
 
Neither one of us believes everything that chiros claim. But as for helping
everyday back troubles, we would both try a chiro first.

Once I had an intense muscle spasm in my back that muscle relaxants didn't
do anything for.  It was extremely painful.  I went to my mother's chiro
and in 15 minutes I walked out feeling great.  The spasm was gone and it
never came back.
The only other cases I've seen are people at my karate studio who see
chiros.  I have seen several people with hip problems go to chiros and
their flexibility has increased tremendously.  Their high kicks are now
much stronger, faster and higher in my opinion. The difference is visibly
obvious, and impressive, to me. Also,  they claim that the pain in their 
hip joints is now gone. (We don't advocate high kicks for tactical reasons, 
but that's a entirely different subject!! :-)).
I have developed similar problems with my hip joints.  The joints are painful
when I'm sitting in a chair and spread my knees apart (bad sign eh?) and I
develop laower back pain when I take a fairly long walk.  I'm considering
a chiro,  but I will see a MD first to rule out things like arthritis, 
obvious injury, etc.
I feel that chiros are great if they STAY WITHIN THEIR DOMAIN.  When they
start trying to treat diseases, etc.  they then become quacks.

One of the things I forgot to add in my recent posting was the time I went
to my chiropractor for my regular ""maintenance"" (adjust the timing, change
the spark plugs... :-)), and I happened to have had a lingering headache.
When I told the chiro about it, and described where the headache was, he
immediately asked, ""Are you on a diet?  Or have you recently changed your
eating habits?""  Well, it so happened that I had just gone on 2nd shift at
work, and I was eating at all kinds of weird hours.  The chiro kind of
pressed down on my stomach, and the headache pain was noticeably diminished.
To avoid a recurrence, I merely ""regularized"" my eating hours.
People have said in past articles that chiros don't seem to know that a
back has a front attached to it.  Perhaps that's because they're going
to the wrong chiropractor.

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.
Motss stands for ""Members of the Same Sex.""

I read in a recent article on ""Orgasm"" in Discover magazine (or one of
the clones) that the vaginal lubricant produced during arousal in women
is simply 'filtered blood serum' ie, blood cells are removed. This would
probably not remove the virus. How this enters the mans body in
significant amounts is another question.","77t6UjDDyQkJ",13,1986-02-24,8,14

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate
into a discussion on AIDS transmission in Africa is just one of those
phenomenons of the USENET ...

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

""Send him in!"" you reply and in a matter of moments a short, but muscular
man walks into your office wearing a moustache and carrying a hockey stick.
Suddenly, as the door slams shut behind him, the fellow jumps four feet
into the air and crashes to the floor.

""You okay?"" you murmur as you assist the gentleman.
""Oui,oui, eeet eees only zeee scratch,"" he says as he seats himself.

""Huh??,"" you say in bewilderment, as your reflex hammer falls off your nose

With this sound, the little man once again leaps into the air, this time

You are perplexed.
Which consultant should you call?
What's wrong with this man?
HERE'S THE ANSWER !!!!
	This illness is known as Jumping Frenchman's Disease or the syndrome
of the Jumping Frenchmen of Maine or as Myriachit. This entity was first des-
cribed in 1878 by Dr. George Beard at the 4th Annual Meeting of the American
Neurological Association. He described 50 cases and noted that the disorder
began in childhood, was familial, rarely encountered in females and lasted
through life. It is marked by an exagerated startle response, causing the
sufferer to leap violently into the air at the least noise or surprise.
	These patients also suffer echolalia and the irresistable compulsion
to obey commands even if doing so might be injurious to themselves. ""When
two 'jumpers' were close together and commanded to 'strike,' each struck
the other simultaneously, often severe and painful blows.""
	The disease gets it's name from the fact that the first victims
were often French-Canadians or residents of Maine. The term Myriachit
comes from the Russian ""to act foolishly"" and basically connotes a similar
syndrome which they of course claim to have discovered first. At any rate,
though a rare entity, cases of this syndrome do occasionally crop up and
have been described in the literature as recently as 1967.(*) For more on this
strange illness, see V.42 of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology, p.231

I appreciate your sentiment, but let's keep some perspective.  It's  a  lot
easier  and  cheaper  to  make a soldier than a doctor.  Also, the level of
intelligence required to be a doctor is found in a much smaller  percentage
of the population than that required for a soldier.
I suspect the figures even out considerably if you compare dollar costs  or
times  required  for  training  soldiers  and  doctors. (You could even try
summing IQ's (-: ).
A more relevant question is:  Can one doctor adequately serve 1,050 people?
My  understanding  is  there's currently a surplus of doctors in the United
States.  It's the uneven distribution that causes problems.

Again, the wrong question is implied.  More relevant:  Would spending  more
than  $140 million dollars annually significantly speed up the finding of a
cure for AIDS?  I'd cheerfully trade a couple of F-16's  for  a  cure,  but
it's not at all clear that such a tradeoff exists.

	No, $140M in a year probably wouldn't cure AIDS, but one tenth of that
could vaccinate every child in America fully, which would probably save just
as many lives.

	Is it just me, or is it only that people who are missing the point
are following up. (Hmm, what is the average IQ of a Usenet poster :-) )
	I'm not saying that there should be one doctor for every 28 people,
but isn't one soldier for every 28 people too much. Is there not a better
use of human resources than war, which consumes so much, and produces so 
little.

Not to say that Craig's sentiment is incorrect, but the figures I have
seen for the cost of an F-16 are quite different. According to ""The
Arsenal of Democracy"", we have paid the following prices for F-16s:
1979	145 @ $ 9.482 M
1980	175 @ $ 9.465 M
1981	120 @ $14.088 M
1982	120 @ $17.608 M
1983	120 @ $18.704 M
1984	144 @ $17.717 M
1985	150 @ $24.900 M
Two F-16s shouldn't be more than $50 to $70 M in 1986.
Some of the prices we have charged other
countries for F-16s include:
Iran
	160 @ $14.844 M, 1978, including a contribution to F-16 R&D costs
Israel
	75  @ $15.453 M, 1978
	55  @ $23.575 M, 1979
Netherlands
	30  @ $ 7.199 M, 1980
Pakistan

Note also that, if you know you do not have AIDS or any other
infectious disease, you help increase the healthy blood supply by
donating!  (And the nurses will help you determine what might be
disqualifying.)
For recent, good information on AIDS and other diseases that are
tested for in blood donors, contact your local Red Cross chapter's
Blood Services, Health Services, or Nursing & Health Services, or
your local hospital.  Then, ask for a bloodmobile schedule!

I recall that the Red Cross won't take your blood if you have taken an
antimalarial drug and traveled in a region where malaria is prevalent.
I don't recall which of the 2 conditions they specify.  So, my question
is:  Which of the following conditions makes your blood *unacceptable*?
	(1) travel to a malaria infested area?
	(2) use of chloroquin (or premiquin (sp?))?
	(3) use of fansidar (YA antimalarial)?

        There was a time when the ARC would not accept blood
from anyone who had taken any cold remedy containing
quinine. I had a had a bout with bronchitis (back in the
50s) and had been given a Rx containing quinine to help stop
the cough, and several months later tried to donate blood.
The ARC said no go - even atropine (I guess belladonna, too)
was a no-no. Wonder how long that stuff stays in the system?
Has this rule been changed?

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.
[Feedback, anyone?]

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

one useful line of therapy against AIDS and other retroviruses would be to
develop drugs that SELECTIVELY inhibit reverse trascriptase, the enzyme that
such viruses use to convert their RNA genomes into DNA that can be

eukaryotic counterpart to this virus.  Of course, it immediately occurred to
me that actual scientists must have been researching this already, and I've

already suffering the effects of successful viral attack; I guess you'd

	Quote from Laurence,Jeffrey, 1985, The Immune system in AIDS,
		Scientific American,Dec.,vol.253,no.6,p.84-93.
	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become 
	increasingly well defined; they include homosexual and
	bisexual men, abusers of injected drugs, the sexual
	partners of people in AIDS risk groups, and children born
	of mothers at risk. Recipients of blood transfusions and blood
	products have also contracted AIDS, but screening of
	donated blood for evidence of infection has drastically
	reduced their risk. The fact that the disease shows
	*NO SIGN* of spreading beyond those groups, except to
	predictable targets such as women who are artificially
	inseminated from infected donors, indicates that the
	virus is ONLY transmitted through the blood or through
	sexual intercourse. *ALL EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE INDICATES
	THAT FOOD, WATER, INSECTS AND CASUAL CONTACT DO NO SPREAD
	AIDS.""
	This is a good article on how this virus affects the immune
	system in great detail. The one thing of note that has
	come out of the studies is that it ""appears that the total
	collapse of the immune defenses in AIDS victims stems
	largely from a single defect : a reduction in the number
	and a change in the function of the T4 lymphocytes, one

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

announced at a conference of 3000 physicians (but apparently not to the

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around
the middle of Jan. '86.

	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have

Way back when I thought about getting into medicine, I was working at M. D.
Anderson in Houston.  3-west was the lung cancer wing.  The smoke concentra-
tion in the waiting rooms in that wing were the highest in the building.
Seems everyone was so NERVOUS visiting their friend/relative that just
had a lung or larnyx removed that they needed SOMEthing to calm down --
like a cigarette.  I suggested that a lung which had been removed from a
patient by dried (run air to expand and dry it) and then displayed in
a case in the waiting room.  I was told that would be beyond the bounds
of good taste.  I guess that cancerous, tar-filled lungs are OK, as long
as they are on the inside....

Spencer Gifts and other similar specialty shops offer a ""lung ashtray,""
which is a plain ashtray with a clear hollow plastic model of a lung
suspended over it to catch the smoke and cloud up. A very graphic

No.  These only make people who are already non-smokers feel smug.
When I was a smoker they actually served to remeind me of how much
I wanted a cigarette.   Perhaps, as dave suggests, I was a non-thinking
smoker.   Still, the objective is to make all smokers quit, isn't it,
whether they are non-thinking or thinking.

[DAVE] Thanks for a very interesting insight. If a lung ashtray only
served to remind you of how much you wanted a cigarette, obviously my
suggestion is not going to work as a deterrent. My implication that
""thinking smokers"" would be deterred is also disproven by your
observations, since obviously you were thinking at the time you were
reminded of how bad you wanted a cigarette. Apparently the desire for
a cigarette is not a logically based desire, and attempts to deal with
it logically (i.e., ""convince you it is harmful and you will quit"") will
not work. But this raises the question, What IS the best way to deal
with it? Or is there ANYTHING a non-smoker can do to influence a smoker
to quit; perhaps it must be the smoker's decision, and there is no way
to influence it from the outside?

Bingo!
If someone who smokes quits, it will be at a time of his choosing and
for his own reasons.  When someone assails them with the ""Smoking is
bad for you because..."" tirade, they think, ""Boy, this person thinks
I'm so stupid that I don't know all of this.  If he thinks I'm going
to pay any attention to such an arrogant and holier-than-thou jerk, he's
got another think coming.""
In other words, all that will happen if you spout off about the perils
of smoking is that you will totally discredit yourself in the eyes of
the person that you're supposedly trying to help.  (I say ""supposedly"",
because there really are a lot of arrogant and holier-than-thou jerks
out there who don't really want to help at all; they just want to
denigrate smokers so that they'll feel superior).
Okay, so what *can* you do?  First, examine your own motives.  Honestly.
If you feel superior to those who smoke, then kindly keep your mouth
shut (most ex-smokers fall into this category).  Your conceited braying
is obvious to almost everyone, and smokers in particular find it down-
right funny that you think that you're better than they are.
If you don't like the idea that maybe smokers are actually *enjoying*
doing something that you personally would never ever do, then you too
are requested to keep your notions to yourself and your kind.
If you don't like being exposed to smoke, you might try the almost
always ignored route of simply asking the smokers that you deal with to
be considerate of you.  Insist that restaurants have a non-smoking
section, since you can hardly be expected to ask every stranger at
every nearby table to be considerate.  (It probably wouldn't work,
anyway).
If you're concerned about smoking as a ""public health menace"", then
concentrate on *prevention*.  A lot has already been done in this area,
especially on television where ads have been banned and most characters
don't smoke.
If you are concerned about the health of someone special to you, then
you have a difficult time ahead.  Your best bet is to *never* bring up

I agree wholeheartedly.  The ""reminder"" factor is one of the biggest
obstacles to those trying to quit as well.  This goes for both positive
and negative reminders.  When you are trying to quit, you really want to
forget that there are such things as cigarettes and tobacco.

I was about to followup in the same line, but Doug's posting says it
much more clearly than I ever could.  It is the people that you are
close to, who care about you -- that you love -- who have the most
impact on your ability or inability to stop smoking.

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

This has been checked out by the CDC, and apparently there is no risk 
for transmission of HTLV-III via an insect vector.  I'm not sure of the
reference, but I think it's a recent issue of JAMA, in the ""Leads from the
MMWR"" section.
By the way, the virus is inactivated by high and low pH and by exposure to a
temperature of 56 C for ten minutes.  Most standard disinfectants (Lysol,
Clorox) and halogenated hand soaps will also inactivate the virus.

It does seem to me that the FDA positions are sorely lacking.  It is
one thing to have a half dozen or so tranquilizers on the market and
want to be cautious about allowing a seventh on just because it may
have a few less side effects.  It is another thing to tell people
that there is no known treatment that we have approved and you

not factored in to the decision process (or so it seems).

You are assuming that the person you entrust your care to has not misrepresented
his abilities as a healer.  The point is that a large amount of damage may be
done by someone who is misrepresenting him/herself to a small, but nonetheless
gullible segment of society.  Also remember that how gullible a potential
victim is depends on how fast a talker the ""healer"" in question is.  Although
the number of charlatans at large may be small, the potential damage that they
can cause is large, hence the requirement of licensure for the physician.
Remember - I'm not arguing for taking away the right of an INFORMED consumer
of health care to go to who they want, but I think the potential for abuse of
an UNINFORMED consumer makes licensure necessary.

	While my classmates and I found the definition amusing, there was a
uniform reaction to this last line.
	We're spending 4-7 years working 90 hour weeks (and that's a light 
week), going a quarter of a million dollars in debt to get our MD degree and

	It is not illegal to seek medical care from a non-licensed ""healer"".
It is only illegal to offer to GIVE medical care without benefit of a license.
	The question I have is 'Why would you even WANT to entrust your broken
arm to an unlicensed practitioner?'  Without even being a board certified
Orthopedist, I can think of at least a dozen complications of a broken arm

Why not certification rather than licensing?  Let the malpractice
claims sort out the poor practitioners.  (Certification would work
like it does for CPA's.  I can have anyone do my bookkeeping, but
if I want assurance that they know what they are doing, I get a CPA.)

Sorry Craig, you missed my point.           
First---What about the Good Samaritan Law in regards to accidents. A person
        is offering to GIVE medical care. Is that person breaking the law?
        If so why do they do it and run the risk of lawsuits?

In some instances, across the country, the unlicensed practice can be a
felony.  There have even been felonious instances by a licensed doctor.

The Good Samaritan Law was passed to prevent the increasingly common occurence
of normal people, say giving someone CPR, and then getting sued for breaking
a few ribs.  Based on that information, the logic fails.
	Besides, the good samaritan is offering to give First Aid, not
comprehensive medical care.  But the fact that they had to pass the good
samaritan laws proved that at least some lawyers found it profitable to argue
that yes, they were breaking the law. (I don't agree, and I also believe in
altruism as a motive.)

	Didn't you read what I said. It's not illegal at all.  I even kept the

The distinction between LICENSING and CERTIFICATION is a legal
one having little to do with the degree of preparation or skill.
A license gives you the right to do something that would be a crime
for the un-licenced to do.  A certification gives you the right to
do something and claim exceptional expertise at doing it when
others are allowed to do it, but are not allowed to
claim exceptional expertise at doing it.  There may also be
some limitations on the ability of the un-certificated to practice
in some situations.
In the area of medicine, to offer treatment without a licence
is a crime.  Under certification, it would not be a crime; though
taking the offer might be stupid ... :-)
While it is usually the case that both licensing and certification
require some formal training and/or examination; the distinction
between them rests on the penalty for practice when not blessed
by having the paper.  Physicians are licenced, not certified.

Perhaps this is a little off the subject, but have you ever heard
of anyone being convicted of practicing management without a license?
I know several who should have been.

Not knowing what `inspire' means, and only having a shitty dictionary at
hand, I can only guess that the definition you're using is either
   a) ""stimulate to activity"" -- sad but true, or
   b) ""inhale"" (or maybe ingest in some other fashion)
Anyway, could you (or someone) elaborate on ways in which AIDS is acquired
from women?
Also, I just realized that I know that AIDS can be transmitted
via semen or blood, but I don't know how such fluids must contact or
be ingested by the recipient.  For example, I would guess that AIDS
could be transmitted in menstrual fluids (can it also be found in
non-blood vaginal secretions?), but I don't know if it can be
transmitted to a person by bodily contact, or by oral sex.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

says, it can't hurt and may be helpful.  The only reservation is for those
who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such
""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, and
hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the
least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine.  This is the only reason he
is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.

believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with

the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

Oooh! An attack!  Good.
Here's the story.  
On several occasions you have made reference to articles in the popular
media (Newsweek, CBS) on various aspects of health.  You have then gone
on to exposit your favorite theories and statistics as if the articles
you refer to presented them.  Often the articles or reports you look to
for support specifically *contradict* your claims.
I consider this practice both dishonest and deceptive.  You can at least
stop essentially misquoting the sources you claim to represent, as with
the toxicity level of mercury in amalgum filling.  If I find you dishonest
in this respect, how am I to believe your less substantiated claim?
Certainly not without sources.  
Remember, *you* are the one offering cures, not me.  I only report what I
see and hear that I feel you have misrepresented.  I am not a doctor nor
any kind of health practitioner.  I am simply someone leery of snake-oil
salesmen who is trying to do the best for his health as he can.  I expect
those offering panacaea's to do a better job with facts than you seem to
be capable of.
>I am continually amazed at the low opinion some readers of the net

You have been the one accusing AMA related physicians of the same sort of
thing!  I see you like being on the receiving end of that sort of cr*p
about as much as Bill Oliver does.  Perhaps you will begin to tone down
your own accusations.

This tells me nothing.  I've known *lots* of perennial graduate students.
What is the *source* (and the precise levels found) of your data on
mercury toxicity in amalgum fillings.  According to the CBS report, which
you originally cited, even Dr. Morgan admits that this is only a problem
with people particularly sensitive to heavy-metal poisoning (I don't know
what that means, but it seems different from what you are saying.)

Like I said originally, the ADA (or whatever professional Dentist's
association) *has* been studying this problem and long before your
lawyer friend wrote a letter.  Obviously, being self-serving sons of
b*tches, they don't count, right :->  They do disagree with you, or
at least according to the CBS report.
>My first impulse was to smile at Byron Howes comments.  However, he
>writes like a thinking person---he is just seriously underinformed.
I don't claim to be informed.  I'm just noting that while you and I
claim to have seen the same CBS report, your article said very different
things about it than I saw.  The same happened with the Newsweek report
about sugar.  You made very different claims for the article than were
actually in the text of the article.
In what *other* ways are you making misstatements of fact that I don't
know about if my poor feeble underinformed brain can spot these.

I haven't the faintest idea what your motives are, and I don't care.
I'm only afraid that serious damage (not to mention expense) is going
to be incurred from misinformation, from any quarter.
> Mr. Howes assumption that I am a fool reflects

I think Bill Oliver has noted that simply isn't true.  You impune the
ability and integrity of all AMA related doctors all the time.  I'll
let the readers of this newsgroup decide whether I am a fool or not.
That is hardly relevant.

I routinely distrust individuals unwilling to make their complete arguments
publicly. I've been through this with the fundamentalists and the creationists
and I'll go through it with you.  If you believe what you have to say is
important, than back it up.  As one of the posters to net.origins is very
fond of saying ""extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof"" not simply
your word or promises of references.

What time is this, Walt?  Again, are you seriously interested in people's
health and well being or merely proving yourself ""superior"" to mainstream
medicine.  Understand, I have no disagreement with Holistic medicine or
the concept thereof.  Some of your ideas may be accurate.  There is
possibly much to be learned there.
So long as you continue to misrepresent others, however, in an effort to
""sell"" your position I find I am unable to distinguish truth from falsehood
in what you say.  I certainly am not going to take you very seriously if
I feel I have found evidence (which I do) that you are selling me a bill
of goods with little substance.

There are four stages of societal response to the discovery of
radically new concepts (in this order):     
     #1  Ignore it and it will go away.
     #2  Ridicule
     #3  Attack 
     #4  Total acceptance:  ""Well, that's obvious!  We knew that all
         the time!
Twice now, Steve has ridiculed something I have placed on the net;
only to have strong evidence to the contrary be published within a few
days of his unsupported position.  His response has been to regress
(like the child who reverts to bedwetting when the new baby is brought
home from the hospital) from the relatively advanced societal response
of ridicule to the relatively more primitive strategy of ignoring.
Sorry Steve,  you're going to have to work harder and harder to ignore
what is rushing, like an avalanche, into all our lives.  Just today,
in one of the many Medical Journals I read every day, in the special
section called Medical Ethics (appropriate, I think), Thomas Preston,
MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine
& Chief of Cardiology at Pacific Medical Center, joined my side.  In a
one page statement,""Palliative Care No Match for Prevention of
Disease"", one more outstanding clinician points out exactly my
position: Reference--Medical World News/September 9, 1985 (page 19).
The same day two more articles in the same vein: Family Practice News/
September 1-14, 1985, page 16, ""Medicare Asked to Take Part in
Promoting 'Wellness'"" & page 18 (same issue) ""Promoting Healthier
Life-Styles Challenging, Rewarding"".
Even the AMA has already reached the last of the four societel
responses.  In American Medical News/September 13, 1985, the
announcement is made that the third special supplement to Newsweek by
the AMA appears in the Sept. 9th edition, titled: ""To your health!
Building and keeping a healthy body.""  The supplement covers such
topics as nutrition, exercise, and disease prevention.  The only
professional national medical organization that specializes in this
field is the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA).  For the
past 7 years, since the beginning of the AHMA, the AMA has done as
much as it legally could to stifle it.  The very things the AMA is now
claiming for its own has been practiced for many years by Holistic
Medical Practitioners.  Of course, the AHMA is now practicing an
advanced form of what was known 7 years ago.  It will be years before
the conventional medical practitioner catches up though catch up they
will eventually.  It should already be considered malpractice to offer
less than is known.  Eventually that may be what forces many MDs to go
back to learn all this new stuff.  
Trying to pitch the offerings to the net to satisfy the lowest common
denominator would be a sad thing for the rest of us.  Maybe we can
create a ""special class for slow learners like the Steve Dyers"".

I have stated twice, Walt, that my facts were taken from the articles
in Newsweek you claim to have read and the CBS (and CNN) news reports
you claim to have seen.  I submit that either by deliberation or by
simple inability to grasp ideas you have misrepresented the medical
findings in those very same sources to the network and perhaps to
yourself.  Whatever the reason, I find this behavior in a health pro-
fessional very frightening.
If it makes you feel any better, I wouldn't entrust myself to an
AMA-type doctor who was incapable of correctly drawing simple
conclusions either.  (This has nothing to do with the correctness
of the conclusions, but the correctness of the process of drawing
conclusions.)  If I see that a person cannot reliably draw facts
from material I am familiar with, what am I to think about the facts
drawn from material I am not familiar with?

Here is my personal opinion. I have known many people on both
sides of this issue. The unorthodox group is often guilty
of an unscientific approach lacking in logic. The orthodox
group seems to go too far in the other direction, trying to
reduce everything to ""logic and scientific materialism"".
(not that I accuse Steve of this, I just used the above
 as a starting point for this letter.)
I thought that Godel's incompleteness theorems, Quantum
physics and such had blown scientific materialism out of
the water, at least as far as being a ""true"" description
of the world. What the unorthodox approach has in its favor
is often based on personal experience, which tends to be
difficult to treat scientifically.
I think that the orthodox group might benefit from practices
promoting personal experience (perhaps Yoga/meditation, fasting
or whatever), while the unorthodox group might benefit from
a study of logic.

Poor Stoll, so predictable.  What do you think you have been spewing all
over the net with statements like ""RA RA"", ""WHO's LAUGHING NOW?"", and
all the other useless mudslinging articles?
Just ridicule and attack, that's all.
While you have some interesting points to discuss your method of
presentation is that of a raver with a HUGE chip on his shoulder.
I am going to apply #1 to you; I hope you will somehow go away.  I find
your logic VERY offensive, and your narrow-mindedness repungent. I advise
everybody else to add ""reply to WWS"" in their subject line so I can
ignore those postings too.

P.S. I don't like electromagnetic pollution either, but it doesn't
mean I have to throw the baby out with the bath water. M.D.'s still
have my trust,  one even suggested I see a chiropractor the other
day.  This is in Canada of course, we might have a different breed
of MD's and Chiropractors.

Garbage, Walt, and you know it!  When you stop misrepresenting facts I

distort and downright lie to promote your position, you are going to have
to expect that folks will be suspicious of what you say.  I don't want

Sure, Walt.  All AMA-type physicians were/are against prevention so they
can make big bucks providing useless cures.  Nobody ever looked at
stress as a causative factor in disease until the holistic physicians
came around, nobody was ever aware of dietary factors in disease until
holistic physicians came to be and nobody knew about the relationship
between diet and mood until holistic physicians discovered it.  (The above
paragraph is to be read with heavy sarcastic tones.)

You read it here folks.  Say, Walt, how come I learned all of these things
in elementary school -- before the American Holistic Medical Association
came to be.  Looks to me like the situation is reversed:  you, in the name
of the AHMA, are claiming for your own the very thing that have been
practiced for years by members of the AMA.  Again, this is a false repre-
sentation and you probably know it!

Those on the ""orthodox"" side have personal experiences too.
Sometimes these experiences include controlled double blind experiments.
Amazing how the personal experiences of the ""unorthodox"" are almost
never reproducible by non-true believers in that particular
""unorthodoxy"".  In those few cases when they ARE reproducible, they
quickly become the new orthodoxy.

I would like to clarify my comment, in case there are others like Walt
who may have misinterpreted me.  I was not proposing ""ignoring"" crackpots, as

Well, I will risk being branded as a heretic and say that the fact
that an experience is not reproducible does not mean it is invalid.
(Unfortunately if one is willing to accept reports of such experiences
one is likely to be victimized by charlatans and/or irrational people.)
Some things may not be susceptible to experimental verification
(isn't there a principle in physics that observing an event changes it?)
I am not rejecting the scientific method. I am surrounded by
these holistic types out here in Northern California and for
years have been trying to get some of them to be more rational.
But I also think they do a lot of good.
I would also like to state that I do not have as much faith
in the representatives of orthodoxy as you seem to. I seem
to recall that some pioneers in science have been put through all
kinds of persecutions before their views became the new orthodoxy.
Perhaps some correct views never were accepted. How do you know?

Unfortunately no-one never claimed that it's the ""true"" description of
the world. All we can say is that so far it works, unlike any other

I'm not so sure that noone ever claimed scientific materialism
is a true description of the world. (Isn't something along
those lines part of Marxist doctrine?) But anyway basically what
I was trying to say is that it is a good model (actually quite
an amazingly good model), but that it should be understood as
being a model rather than truth. As you say, choosing a model
based on what works is part of what SM is all about, as I
understand it.
My particular pet theory which I've been trying to integrate
with existing models is rather controversial and has to do
with adding as an axiom the existence of a soul, without saying
anything about God, religion etc. Since this is somewhere
out in left-field as far as most people are concerned I
won't burden you with the details ... (this view is
heretical both to religious and materialistic types ...)
What I like about Godel's theorems, Quantum physics, etc.,
is that they seem to suggest something mysterious is going
on that isn't readily explainable. I like mysteries ...
Apologies to the readers for burdening them with my personal
opinions ... I won't put any more of this in the net.

I am Bill Stoll; Walt Stoll is my father.  I got my Masters in CS at the
University of KY at which I had (and still have) an account.  When
I came to work for AT&T, I discovered USENET.  The discussions in
net.med made me think of him, so I suggested he buy a modem for his
Macintosh and use my old account to join the discussion.  It has
been a lot of fun for him, and I'm proud to see him finally getting
involved with computers.
I have to throw in my 2 cents regarding ""net.med.holistic"".  As Walt
adjusts to ""netiquette"" and the high intelligence of this audience,
I think you will see less public flaming and accusations, and more
facts presented with evidence worthy of discussion.  My somewhat
biased opinion is for people interested in new breakthroughs (and
important ""rediscoveries"") to wait a few months more before giving
him his own newsgroup or unsubscribing to him.

While I certainly agree that this is so, I don't think you can really
fault the physicians.  It is not they who research medical matters;
they can only apply whatever information the researchers provide.
And I can't even fault the researchers, inasmuch as there are still
a number of ""sicknesses"" that I'd rather see cures/prevention for
(AIDS, MS, and cancer to name just a few), rather than have them
spending their time and money on researching ""better wellness"".

Dear Frank,
Holistic Medicine has the cures for your list.  When I practiced
Conventional Medicine alone I had no cures for any of your list.
In addition, the cures for the ills on your list have many powerful

AIDS:  Casual contact exonerated
--------------------------------
    Research findings on AIDS at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Minneapolis this week covered the gamut from
good to bad to surprising.  The good news:  The syndrome is apparently not
transmitted through casual household contact and hence not among school
children; health care workers who handle AIDS patients, even workers who have
accidentally stuck themselves with needles, have little if any chance of
becoming infected, according to researchers.
    The bad news:  Heterosexual transmission, at least in Haiti and Africa, is
becoming increasingly prevalent.  And the surprising news:  The virus
associated with the disease may have been around as long ago as 1962.
    A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study of 101 members of households that
included an AIDS sufferer shows transfer of infection only in one instance, in
a baby born to an infected mother.  ""From this study,"" says Martha F. Rogers of
the CDC in Atlanta, who headed the study, ""our best estimate of the risk of
household transmission is zero.""  The belief that AIDS victims in schools can
transmit the disease, she says, has no scientific basis in the data collected
thus far.
    Three studies presented at the meeting show little if any risk to health
care workers involved with AIDS patients.  In a CDC study of 802 workers
nationwide who had been exposed to AIDS blood or body fluids, only one person
with no other risk factors was infected with the virus; of 527 health care
workers in two prospective studies, only 1 of 95 workers who had accidentally
stuck themselves with a needle, showd evidence of exposure.  The incidence
might be so low because it takes repeated exposures or an overworked immune
system to allow the virus to establish itself, researchers suggested.
    Heterosexual transmission is establishing itself as a mode of infection in
Haiti and Africa.  In Haiti, 14 percent of AIDS victims in a 1980-1982 survey
were women; thus far in 1985, 36 percent are women, reports Warren D. Johnson
Jr., of Cornell Medical College in New York City.  When the researchers
questioned AIDS patients about recent deaths of spouses, they found 5 percent
had spouses who died of confirmed AIDS and another 15 percent had died of what
seemed to be AIDS.
    A study in Kenya, which has not reported a high AIDS incidence, shows the
virus is establishing itself among prostitutes at an alarming rate.  Of 64
women who served a ""lower class"" clientele, 42 had AIDS antibodies, while 8 of
26 with a ""higher class"" clientele had antibodies; no overt disease has yet
been seen.
    Where the virus comes from remains to be solved, but a report at the
meeting may add 10 years to its age.  J.A. Epstein and colleagues at the Food
and Drug Administration reported finding AIDS-specific antibodies in two of 544
blood samples collected in Upper Volta in 1963--10 years earlier than
previously reported Ugandan samples (SN:3/16/86,p.173).  Whether this means the
AIDS virus itself was present, or just a similar virus, remains to be seen,
Epstein says.                                                    --J. Silberner

So, don't bite people!  Don't associate with biters.  But don't use this as a
reason to bar non-biters from school.  In my whole school career, I found it
necessary to bite one person -- a teacher who hit first.
If a person at school bites, send the idiot home!  Not because he/she
has/doesn't have AIDS. but because biting is not a useful educational 
activity.

feel that there is much more danger to the child with AIDS

a child having AIDS attending school, there is a much
greater risk of the child catching what would normally
be a simple childhood disease and not being able to
fight it off.  Take chicken pox as an example.  There once
was a tribe of indians living in the area of northern Iowa
that was wiped out after coming in contact with chicken pox.
The same thing happened in the area of Easter Island some
200 years ago.  So, since chicken pox can kill those
without an immunity, the child with AIDS will have the
same problem.  I feel that putting the child into this
environment would be a greater risk to the child than
that supposed risk to those around the child.  Shoving
a child into the school based on principles is not helping
the child or solving the problem.  It is mearly satisfying

	It begins with fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a sore throat (just
like a cold.)  However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces every
organ to close shop.
	Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseases

U. researchers.
	The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in a 
missionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.
After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospital
in Jos, where she died the next day.
	Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of the
disease, and a third was deathly ill.  She was flown to New York (prompting
several staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )
and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,
survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.
	Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to study 
additional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing the
epidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,
the first outbreak's final victim.

to treat Lassa fever, is currently undergoing clinical trials against the
AIDS virus.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

It seems to me that the methods of AIDS transmission, while not 100% certain,
are quite well enough known that this should be unnecessary.  Hopefully

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.

hand-to-hand  combat.   They are not expected to lose those skills.  All

Since dentists learned that sugar caused cavities they have been in
the forefront of the research involving sugar.  The medical profession
has been ""johnnie come latelies"" in this field.
As far back as 1964 dental research had shown that a moderate dose of
sugar was sufficient to drastically reduce the ""phagocytic index"".
For those of you who don't know:  The phagocytic index is a measure of
how many bacteria a white blood cell ingests in one hour.  It is a
very accurate measure of one form of immunity.  Now that AIDS research
$ has made it possible to measure many aspects of immunity in fine
detail, and sugar has hit the ""big time"" by being on the cover of
Newsweek, I'm sure it won't be long before these studies are repeated
measuring many more parameters.
I will just list the table that summarizes that first study and wait
for the predictable denials from those who still don't want to know:

This study has, of course, been replicated many times.  The last time
that I am aware of was by Emanual Cheraskin, MD, DDS, who was Chairman
of the department of Dentistry at the University of Alabama Dental
School at the time.  He has gone on to dedicate his life to educating
the public, and any professionals who will listen, of the pervasive
health burdens caused by refined carbohydrates.
The same amount of glucose ingested in an unrefined state (in other
words, with all the 48+ nutrients it grew up with--in the exact
proportion that it existed in nature) causes no reduction in the
phagocytic index.
You know, a grain of wheat is alive.  No matter how long it is in
storage it is slowly running its own ""Krebs cycle""(the same metabolic
cycle we humans use to process all forms of carbohydrates).  Those 48+
nutrients are present in the exact proportion, and in the exact amount,
necessary to digest exactly the amount of carbohydrate in that grain
of wheat. Nature is pretty tidy that way.
If we eat the grain of wheat as it is we get everything needed to
metabolize exactly that much starch.  If we allow the food processors
to remove the 48+ nutrients first, then, when we eat the refined
product, our bodies must take those 48+ nutrients from storage in
order to run the ""Krebs Cycle"".  So long as a certain % of refined
foods is not exceeded the human has reserves enough to get along.  The
best estimate by those who have taken the time to understand the field
(so far as we do understand it) is that we can tolerate about 15% of
our carbohydrates refined.  Above 15%, even with our presently
available crude measuring techniques, measurable decreases in function
occur.  The present average in this country is 60% refined &
increasing every year.  We have but to look at comparable statistics
from Guam (which has persistantly led our % here in the US by about 5
years--presently 65%+) to see what we can expect of our future chronic
disease incidence.
The problem is not a lack of research data but the unwillingness to
accept things that hit so close home as our own eating habits--one of
the most personal of things.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

My brother is an oncologist.  He mentioned that he heard from another
doctor at a party that autopsies of Alzheimer's disease patients showed
increased levels of aluminum in their brain tissue.  ""And what do

Feel free to take it from there.
(My brother was one of the generation that received X-ray treatment
for their tonsils.  He went through med school on an Air-Force
scholarship where he promised to serve after school.  At his pre-induction
physical, he was asked ""Doctor, why do you have a 15% hearing loss on

I'm not sure about topics, but there were two spot radio announcements
by Carlton Fredricks, PhD, that I remember.  Fredricks is a nutritionist
(whatever that means).  He has several books published about nutritional
deficiencies and/or approaches for treatment/relief of certain conditions.
He was sponsored by Lindberg Nutrition which is a chain of Health Food 
stores in LA.
1.  Fredricks claimed that the symptoms of arthritis could be eliminated
or substantially reduced by complete elimination of the foods of the
nightshade family from the diet.  There were 5 items mentioned.  Three of
them were potatoes, tomatoes, and rutabaga.  I don't remember the other two.
Potatoes and tomatoes might take a little doing to eliminate (spaghetti,
lasagna, pizza, etc.) but it seemed to me that someone in the grip of
arthritis would regard that as a small price to pay for substantial relief.
The other two items were even less common than rutabaga.
2.  Fredricks related the story that if a farmer had a cow that couldn't
conceive and called the vet, the first thing the vet would ask is ""What's
the animal been eating?""  But if a woman goes to her doctor to complain about
infertility, the *last* thing the doctor asks is ""what have you been eating?""
(This story obviously doesn't prove anything, but somehow seems to strike
a responsive chord in me).

No.  Iridology is the study of the iris of the eye.  The study of the white

in the whites is very coarse whereas the iris shows great detail.  The current

Chiropractors also represent a source of unnecessary x-rays.  Many
chiropractors do full spine xrays (some even full body xrays)
purporting to show the patient the areas of ""subluxation"".  Of
course the patient is too ignorant of radiology to question what
the chiropractor points out as areas of abnormality.  X ray
machines really don't belong in chiropractor's offices.  Very
few M.D.s have x-ray machines in the office due to the necessity
to have good calibration to avoid excess exposure.  (Dental x-rays
are an exception, but they aren't nearly as dangerous if miscalibration
does occur.)  I would advise people not to let a chiropractor x-ray them.","-06732tVrtEJ",11,1985-08-17,-4,0

I remember them well.  I also enjoyed looking at the bones in my feet.
While I haven't developed food cancer I've often wondered if there was
any relationship between them and my lifelong battle with athlete's
foot fungi.   Does somebody know if, in fact, there is some kind of
correlation between exposure to those devices and cancer of the bones
in the foot?

What I liked even better were the little radiation viewing devices you
sometimes found in cereal or crackerjack boxes. They were little
plastic tubes with a lens at one end and some of the radium material
that goes on watch dials at the other. You could look into it in a
dark room and watch the little flashes ...
This was back around the early '50s, I guess, when anything nuclear was
popular. It seemed like everyone was heading west to hunt for uranium;
movies like ""The Atomic Kid"" with Mickey Rooney were popular; and I
had a brand-new fake plastic Geiger counter I'd play with (it came
with fake uranium rocks and you'd hold the counter up to the rocks and
the counter would click like crazy). I can't remember ANYONE
suggesting that radiation might be bad for you in those days. The
movie ""Atomic Cafe"" captures the spirit of the times well.

Boy do I remember!  I have thought about it for years!
I'm 38 now and remember going to the store in the 50's and looking
at my feet through it until my parents would wisely drag me away.
I always figure that it's just a matter of time before
I have some wierd growth on one of my toes!  It does worry me

I was x-rayed by a chiropractor once.  He wanted a picture of the joint
where my spine meets my skull so he asked me to open my mouth wide and
he took the picture through my open jaws.  No headrest or anything to
hold my head in position.  He didn't get the joint.
Interestingly enough, he didn't wear any protective clothing or get
behind a screen or anything.

Let's not let our prejudism show, I would advise people not to let anyone x-ray
them without good reason.  Many of the clinics that doctors practice in do have
x-ray machines and the best way to pay them off is to x-ray people.  My
siister-in-law is currently attending a chiropractic college and has already
(in her first year) been informed of the dangers and importance of x-rays in
her future field.  Chiropractors are trained specialists, and just like doctors
and dentists, some are good and some are bad.  The only answer is intellegent
patients who have taken time to learn enough to tell the difference.
Uninformed people are one of the major risks in chiropractics, when asked about
their medical past many will take the ""If he's so good let him find out about
my past and tell me!"" attitude, this has led to many injuries because the
chiropractor didn't know about a past problem and did a manouver they would not
have done otherwise.  If you want advice about any form of natural treatment
don't ask a conventional doctor.

	My response was ""Well, you can't rule it our, but it's not something

	A mosquito is not so much like a hypodermic syringe injection as it is
like a needle-stick.  In the last four years, over 500 nurses, doctors, and
med students have accidentally stuck themselves with needles while drawing

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.
	I just thought this might also be of interest to those who are
still wondering to what rigors medical 'proof' must be subjected to.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

I frequently use and recommend herbal remedies for almost any ailment.
The use of herbal laxitives to reduce weight is of course questionable.
It is also true that most people are constipated and are unaware of the
importance of bowel management (most doctors included).  Weight is
often a symptom of other problems and a return to a natural diet would
probably bring most people back to their proper weight.  Leading a
non-sedate lifestyle is also important (I question regimented exercise
with the exception of rebounding).  There is also food mixing, proper
mastication and frequency/timing to consider when eating.
The point is that herbal remedies used properly are of tremendous value
in helping people.  However, companies like Herbalife seem to be fast
buck companies with questionable scruples.  There are some excellent
herb companies with high standards and these should be praised in order
to remind people that segmenting out one group does not ruin the whole
bunch (we have all admitted their are bad doctors).  Herbal methods
have been very succesful in weight loss for those who spent the time to
learn and decided that their life was worth more than getting another
soda.  My family gets herbs from the Nature's Sunshine company and we
have been very pleased.
As a point of history Herbalife was started by a man who claims that
his mother died as a result of malnutrition while taking the Cambridge
Diet.  His qualifications to produce herbs is questionable and their
constant drive to ""Lose weight Now ask me how"" indicates that weight
loss is of more importance than health, not a very wholistic viewpoint.
Don't use Herbalife as an example unless you state that they are a bad
example.  None of their distributers has ever explained to me how they
can put a herb in tablet form without corrupting it.

On a more serious note, is anyone else as appalled as I am about the
recent promotion of nonoxynol-9-containing lubricants/spermicides as
actually PREVENTING AIDS?  Even a supposedly well-meaning person like
Bruce Voeller, a fairly well-known gay activist, is promoting this stuff
through an organization known as the ""Mariposa Foundation.""
It is a very very far cry from noting that nonoxynol-9 inactivates
HTLV-3 virus in vitro to recommending it as a prophylactic measure
during sex.  We simply DON'T KNOW what kind of effect it may have
on the spread of AIDS--it might as easily facilitate its spread through
some bizarre surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  People who use
an agent like this as an excuse to return to dangerous sex practices
are being deceived in the worst way, and it seems to me that the Mariposa
Foundation and other promoters of nonoxynol-9 should be on hand to sign

It seems to me that they are opening themselves up for a good lawsuit

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	I have my own small addition, I tested positive for ""hepatitis""
last summer, but negative for A/B.  I eventually discovered I had
mononucleosis.  Thus non-A/B hepatitis can also be a secondary symptom
of some other disease.

Should someone who tests positive tell a potential sex partner?  Or are

to a potential/current sex partner is unnecessary.
I don't know what my answer is to any of the questions so far.  I do know
that I was very upset to hear retroactively a repeated partner had Hepatitus-B,

This question is important to me since I have the oppotunity to participate

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual
partner if you had a positive HTLV-III test. A positive antibody test does
*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.","FhgStjPmxOgJ",19,1986-03-21,-10,11

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,
there is no way currently to get rid of the damn thing.","H75UzjNUdRYJ",19,1986-03-21,-9,26

A few years ago I signed up for an AIDS research study being done by the
University of Pittsburgh, as part of a four city project funded by the National
Institutes of Health (the other cities are, to the best of my recollection,
Baltimore, Chicago, and San Francisco).  The study started before HTLV-III
had even been identified, and thus part of the goal of the study was to track
the factors that may be involved in causing AIDS.  I had no reservations about
joining, since I have a very strong belief in empirical research (I sign up for
human interface studies at every opportunity, and always used to participate in
psych experiments as an undergraduate). 
Volunteers in the study came in twice a year to be interviewed on sexual
practices, undergo a physical, and give samples of blood (over a dozen vials at
a time; ouch), urine, semen (this was the fun part) and stool (blech! I can't
see myself ever getting into scat).  I knew at the time that a portion of my
blood would be frozen, to undergo whatever testing might become available at a
future time.  However, I hadn't really thought about the implications of a test
for a virus (or, as it turns out, antibodies to a virus), and I certainly hadn't
thought about many of the political and personal issues.  
In retrospect, the only surprise was that the virus and tests were discovered so
quickly; I would have signed up for the study even after LAV/HTLV-III had been
identified.  Why?  Because we still don't know why only a small percentage of
infected people actually come down with AIDS, and hence this sort of research is
very important.
I should also add that this particular study has been granted some sort of
insurance of confidentiality by the Feds.  I'm not quite sure what this implies,
but presumably it means that their records are more protected than a county
HTLV-III testing program for example.  On the other hand, this certificate was
given after I signed up for the study, so confidentiality obviously wasn't a
priority to me.
Once HTLV-III testing became available, the study did indeed retrieve the stored
blood, and start testing all of the participants.  (Nothing underhanded; we knew
that the potential for this was there when we signed up, although I suspect most
volunteers, like myself, hadn't thought about it very much.)  However, it was
entirely up to us as to whether we wanted to learn the results.  One of the
requirements for getting your results was that you had to participate in a group
discussion session and an individual counseling session before any HTLV-III
results would be revealed.  I think this was an excellent idea, far better than
the health department testing mills, even though I had to pull strings to bypass
this requirement (since I moved to New England before my results were
available).  
As I just indicated, I decided to find out what my results were.  Mostly this
was for my own peace of mind (although, if the tests had turned out positive, it
would have proved that the virus had a much longer incubation period that
previously suspected :-).  But also it was to help me decide how to lead my
life.  I think that if I had tested positive I would either a) decided to remain
celibate, which is close to what I've been doing anyway; b) limited my dating to
other men who tested positive, either through support groups or candid personal
ads; or c) limited my sexual activity to strictly safe, kinky stuff with little
or no chance of emotional attachments forming.
Which brings me to the last question, namely should a person who test positive
inform partners?  My response, as indicated, is that I would choose to avoid 
situations in which this was likely to become an issue.  I could not see myself
dating someone while burdened by the constant anxiety of knowing that someday I
would have to reveal this information if the relationship is going to continue.
I know this is evasive to some extent, since avoiding such situations doesn't
insure that they won't occur.  I can't honestly say what I would do if I were
in such a situation, although I like to think I would find the courage to be
honest from the start.  I guess I'm lucky in knowing that I won't be in that
situation at all.
The other side of the coin is how would I feel if I were going with someone who
revealed to me that he tests positive.  I have a close friend who is positive, 
so I know I can be with someone who's positive without freaking out (which is
not to say I have no anxieties, but only that they're quite manageable).  Thus,
if someone with whom I was forming an emotional attachment turned out to be
positive, I think I would be able to continue the relationship.  I would
probably evaluate the relationship in the context of a sex life that would no
doubt have some restrictions, which could potentially be an issue.  But I 
learned a long time ago not to expect to have all my fantasies fulfilled.
(Reality is more than enough fun, anyway.)

Choice b is not a wise choice unless they practice safe sex.  The accepted
thinking is that the various mutations of HTLV-3 do not infect in quite
the same way and that a cross infection might be all you need to go
from non-symptomatic to symptomatic (ARC or AIDS).

1) I was worrying about my health all the time, to the point
where I wouldn't exercise well for fear that I might exacerbate
an AIDS or ARC condition (or so I rationalized).
2) I was practising category 1 (very likely safe) and category
2 (probably safe) sex with two partners and just didn't feel I
could justify category 2 with them unless I was fairly certain
I hadn't been exposed to the virus.
In other words, I was worrying enough so that it couldn't hurt
my mental condition all that much to find out a positive result
(although I could have been underestimating the impact it would
have on me) and I wanted to restrict myself to only category 1
sex if I had been exposed to the virus.
I wouldn't have taken the test unless I was sure to be
guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality through the
alternative test sites here in California.  If you decide
to have a personal physician conduct the test, ask the physician
not to record the result in your medical record, or anywhere
else.
Obviously, the decision of whether or not to take (one of) the
test(s) is highly charged and completely determined by individual
situation and feelings.  Certainly, one should be well aware of
what one is doing before taking a test which may let you know
of horrible consequences to come.  But not knowing and having
the disease might be even worse for some.

----------------------------------------------------
My favorite TV show with a gay/lesbian theme was an old episode of 
Cheers.  On that episode, an old friend of Sam's (who happens to have 
been a teammate on his professional baseball team) comes out as a gay 
man during a publicity show for his new book.  This part of the show
happens in the first five to ten minutes and the rest of the show
illustrates how people react to the news once the gay character is
off-stage. 
Sam is hurt and confused by the confession (""Yunno, why can't guys be 
guys?""); Dianne is cool and calm; and, Norm starts to get nervous that 
Cheers is going to become a gay bar once all the gay men find out how 
open Sam is to gay people.  
When a good-looking, well dressed couple of young men go up to the bar 
and order a light beer, Norm is convinced that the gay invasion has 
started.  The couple admits that they read in the paper about Sam's 
reaction to his buddy's comming out, and that they admire him for his 
stance.
Dianne adds fuel to the fire by stating to Norm that she knows for a 
fact that there are two gay men in the bar ""right at this very moment."" 
Norm organizes everyone else in the bar, and then procedes to go to
ridiculous lengths to drive the two young men out of the bar. 
After he finally succeeds, Norm gloats about his success.  
Unfortunately for him, Dianne tells him that the two gay men are 
still in the bar.  At which point, the two men on either side of Norm 
(older, graying, balding, casually dressed) lean toward him and kiss 
him on the cheek. [the curtain falls]
That's my favorite gay-themed TV show because it doesn't preach about 
being gay or having AIDS, but it delivers the message in a powerful 
way that we are everywhere and we're not all that different from you 
and yours.
Any thoughts?

that doesn't have any newsworthy theme, but just happens to be about a gay
couple.  ""Parting Glances"" is a brief look into the lives of Michael and Robert,
who've been together for five years, their relationship, and the various
relationships between them and their friends.
The title of the movie is derived from two imminent departures.  Robert, who
works for the International Health Organization (or was it the World H. O.?) is
about to leave for Africa, where he has been assigned to what is officially
expected to be a two year tour of duty.  In the meantime, Michael's closest
friend Nick has AIDS, so that Michael has to cope with losing the two people who
are closest to him (even though Robert's transfer is acknowledged to be
temporary).  
We also get to meet Robert's boss Cecil and his wife Betty, at a going away
dinner that they give for Robert and Michael.  Betty knows the two are lovers,
but believes that Cecil has blinded himself to that fact.  The truth is that
Cecil knows, and it is Betty who is blind to Cecil's fondness for members
of the same sex.  Yet this situation gives rise to an observation by Betty that
is one of the main points being made by the movie, namely that in any love
relationship there is a ""kisser"" and a ""kissee"", that is, one who gives the
bulk of the affection, and the other who agrees to receive it.  In her case, she
is the kisser, and is quite content with Cecil's limited need for affection,
even though she doesn't know his reasons.  However, we can easily apply her
insight to Robert and Michael, since we see that it is almost always Robert who
initiates the physical affection between the two.
Later, we start to understand the relationship between Michael and Robert a
little better.  We learn about Michael's long standing and greater love for
Nick, while it is Robert's insecurity that forces him to plan on being away
until after Nick dies.  In spite of the imperfections in their relationship, and
the few occasions that the movie threaten's us with the possiblity of a
break-up, we are always supported with signals of stability that reassure us
about the success of their relationship.  I believe we get to see the complexity
behind Betty's oversimplification, and thus learn that the best couplings are
not built on the greatest love.
One thing I liked about the movie was the honesty of the characters to
themselves.  While they weren't always honest to each other about their
feelings, I think that each person knew his or her own feelings -- even Robert,
who knew he was confused.  Michael could talk about his love for both Robert and
Nick, and I believe knew why he was coupled with Robert, even though his love
for Nick was greater.  In spite of Cecil's covert rompings, both he and Betty
understood that their relationship was built primarily on a Platonic sort of
love, every bit as important as erotic love.  Even Nick understands the
depression that has hit him because of his illness, although he depends on
Michael for staying afloat.
Some secondary points:  Even though one of the major supporting characters has
AIDS, this is clearly a movie about people, and not about the disease.   While
the sound quality could have been better (and this may have been the fault of
the theater, not the movie), overall the technical quality was excellent, given
the limited market for the film, and presumably the limited resources of the
producers; the cinematography is basic, but professional; the dialogue and
acting flow smoothly, and is never forced; the love scenes are neither
exploitative nor sanitized, but are quite comparable to what we might expect
from a Hollywood PG-13 or soft R heterosexual love scene.
Since stereotypes are a hot topic on motss these days, I admit to having
detected a bit of the New York City guppy stereotype in the film.  Michael and
Robert are both handsome, white, young professionals (but at least they're not
doctors nor lawyers; Robert is a health administrator, while Michael is an
editor).  Their apartment is Upper West Side (I think, but it might have been
Prospect Park or some other -uppie NY neighborhood), but is discreetly furnished
and not particularly gay.  The friends we see at a second going away party,
given by their artist friend Jean, are, however, very stereotypical chic (the
sort we might expect to show up at a Woody Allen party, if he were to ever film
a NY artist's party that was 60% gay).  While I may be overly sensitive to the
stereotype (being an ex-New Yorker myself), I wasn't offended by it, since the
characters weren't plastic.
In summary, I left the theater feeling good, with a renewed faith in the future
of gay life.  I give ""Parting Glances"" 3 1/2 stars; don't miss it.  Playing now
at the Brattle Theater (off of Harvard Square, Cambridge), and fine cinemas
everywhere.","Nzz2uZXmtLwJ",18,1986-03-10,32,11

Just call me George, its not my real name but being the gutless wonder
that I am I do not want to bare my soul and my real name at the
same time.  You may respond to the net or Steve Dyer will relay mail
back to me.
I am a computer professional, single, in my early thirties, and bisexual.
I am still quite confused about my sexuality despite having stuck one
or more feet out of the closet as long as 15 years ago.  I am currently
in psychotherapy with a ""non-aligned"" therapist (probably Jungian at
heart) who at least professes to believe that people are innately
bisexual; no fighting a therapist who wants to *change* me.
(How many therapists does it take to change a light bulb? One, but the
light bulb really has to want to change.)
A little background: My first sexual experience was at 10 or 11.  It
was with my best friend B.  I don't remember who initiated the
encounters, but after a while it definetly was me who initiated.
Aside from an adult Boy Scout leader, Mr. R, whose initiation rites were
a bit outside of social acceptability (the Patrol leader and assistant
were blindfolded and ""made"" to 69) I never had what could be termed a
seductive experience.
Incidently the adult leader was married, a pillar of the community etc.
and included his son in the initiations!  His son and I, being the
youngest, did not have explicitly sexual rites but did watch the
other's which were sexual.  The reason I mention this is that a lot
of people are horrified when I mention this and say that I was sexually
abused by this pillar (:-) and that even now, over 20 years later, I
should press charges or something absurd like that.  My personal reaction
is that Mr. R, while a sicky, did not harm me and after one season of
taking us for overnights did not continue.
I, on the other hand, had *very* strong cravings for sex and seduced,
or attempted to seduce, a number of peers.  Around the age of 14 B's
hetero feelings starting to blossom and he starting treating me abusely
(not physically, just socially).  Things never were emotional between
us, we never caressed or kissed or proclaimed love etc. but I guess
he felt guilty and wanted to distance himself.  Didn't stop him from
calling when ""he had the urge"" (of course I was allways willing).
I guess that, my sister seducing another friend (she later claimed
she did not know there was anything between us), and that asshole
Dr David Rueben's _Everything_You_Wanted_To_Know_About_Sex_ (but
couldn't find an educated homophobe to tell you) starting seriously
eroding my self confidence.  My own hetero feelings were starting
at the same time but lacking friends and having miserable role models
of parents I never dated or any of the other ""normal"" adolescent
activities.  When I was invited to a birthday party for one of my mother's
friend's children, I got sick the day of the party because of my
anxiety over going and playing spin the bottle.
The years 14-16 were the first part of my crazy years: drug use, running
away from home (hum, in restrospect I'm don't think that was so crazy,
my home was *very* nutty), declining scholastic achievment (I was
considered very gifted but my parents chose to ignore the pleas of
school officials to place me in a school for gifted).  Anyhow, to cut
thru the wallowing self pity, them years was very painful.  Around my
17th birthday (drivers license time) I discovered a Gay org at the
local college and, at least partially, came out.  No fan-fairs, earth
shaking, or most disappointing, personal problems disappearing.
My first hetero experience was that summer.  It was with the best friend
of my ""girlfriend"" (I was a just a friend to her, she tolerated my clumsy
attempts to go to bed with her).  My GF not only knew about me and her
friend, she let us use her bedroom while she listened from the guest
room.  From a physical standpoint the experience was okay, emotionally
it did nothing for me (she left in the middle of the night and seemed
uneasy around me after that, she was drunk and had been hinting and I
propositioned her).
My college years were bitter-sweet. A lot of promiscuous sex with men
and a lot of attempting sex in relationships with female friends.  I
managed a few times.  I was *very* out of the closet my freshman year
(except to family, going to a school far from home) but went back in
after that because I got too turned off my the campy/sarcastic people
active in the local gay org.
After college things a few things changed, I had a long term affair.
(""remember"", said N, married he, ""if things get emotional I will stop
this like that"" (snap of fingers).  Aside from that limitation
(which delighted me, being as the last thing *I* wanted was an
emotional relationship with a man) it was a good relationship.  We had
a good time together, doing non-sexual things more than sexual.
He insisted that I meet his family (gulp!) who did not know what our
relationship really was.  They thought (or did a damn good job of
pretending) that he was simply befriending another stray pup.
In the middle of that relationship I got involved with a women who lived
in my apartment building.  N, considerately, dropped the sexual portion
of our friendship for the duration.  L and I lived together for three
months and they were hell.  She was crazier than I was!  I couldn't adjust
to her sexual cycle (3 AM, and only when she wanted it) and she didn't
give a damn about mine (any time, especially 7 AM).  I learned alot about
JAP foreplay (two hours of begging and pleading).  I was so desperate
that even suspecting that she was cheating on me I proposed to her.
Thank god she said no!  The relationship ended when she borrowed my
car, failed to pick me up that night, and returned the next morning
man in tow (a neighbor later told me they spent the night in his apt.).
That evening I seduced (for lack of better term) a male friend and shortly
thereafter resumed sex with N.  That was 9 years ago.  Two years later
I spoiled a fine platonic friendship with a women by ignoring her lack
of interest in a deeper relationship and bugging the shit out of her.
After that I immersed myself in the bath house scene, until three years
ago when I went celibate because of AIDS fears.  A little over a year
ago I staring going to female prostitutes because ""I was getting crazy
for sex"" (yes, I masturbated all the time, no real relief).
When I heard that they thought prostitutes were HTLV-3 carriers I stopped
going (about 6 months ago) waited for 8 weeks and got the AIDS antibody
test (negative).  During this time a female friend (yep, you guessed it!)
We never got sexual, the feelings just got too crazy.  After that I
went back to the prostitute twice: first time was okay but I could have
done as good a job myself, second time I couln't touch her, the only
way I could orgasm was to pretend that I was having sex with a man.
I left convinced that there was proof that I am not bisexual, that I
am 100% percent homophile.  My therapist sees that experience as evidence
that I am in better touch with my needs (emotional and compassionate)
and I just felt the emptiness a bit earlier than usual (usually the ""glow""
fades about 10 minutes after I'm done).  I am toying with the idea of
going back to the Gay community, recent contacts with it have shown me
that there does exist a ""healthy"" (non-role playing monogamous) sub-
community.  My real concern is that the problems with women are not
just with women and that I will en up with the same shit in a relationship
with a man.  I might add, as an aside, that I find women *much* more
sexually attractive than men but enjoy sex better with a man.
I may have hurt the women that I have involved with; certainly I have
hurt myself (and two of three hurt me).  I guess I'm just very confused
and looking for people whose life experiences have similarities to mine
who have worked thru the shit.
Thank you for letting me unburden myself!","7G7P5Ct10o4J",14,1986-03-09,-42,31

I think it's interesting that you deleted the part of my posting that read,
""It's not like this is keeping me up nights or anything.  I'm just curious.""
No, I am not interested in having sex with Burt Reynolds.  I simply find it
intriguing, *and* very sad, that actors have to put up such a ""front"" for
their supposedly ""loving"" public, instead of being accepted for what they
are.  This goes for everyone, actually, not just actors.  Look at Rock
Hudson, who struggled to keep his real self a secret for 30-odd years.
Sure, I'd like to see the day when everybody can feel comfortable with their
sexuality, no matter what it is.  Until then, no matter how an actor or
actress feels towards members of the same sex, they'll have to put on an
act of being real womanizers or...manizers?  (I don't hesitate to invent
words to suit my purposes!)

gays"" in cinema/tv. Last night I spent the evening re-cataloging my video lib-
rary. Of the ~260 movies I have about 25 either have a gay theme or there's a
gay character. I queued up just about all of the quazi-gay films and watched
bits and pieces. The one movie I forgot I had is ""That Certain Summer"" with
Hal Holbrook. I can remember when it first aired in the very early 70's, my
mom ordering dad to change the channel when it was becomming clear that there
was going to be mention of homosexuals. I thought it was well done for the
times (early 70's) but the way the son was informed lacked some class, ""yes
I'm a homosexual, that means I slep with men"". I agree with another another
man's posting, that we're much more then sleeping with the same sex.
    Then I rummaged through ""The Sergeant"" with Rod Steiger. Now this one por-
trays the drill instructor as an extreme/suicidal if he ever admits it closet
case. In the end of the film he starts becomming aware that he's got the hots
for the young private and runs off in the woods to blow his brains out. Ok so
this was also a product of the early 70's, being gay=being miserable; better
dead than to bed with Ted :-)
    Around this same time I forget which network aired it but some of you will
remember ""An American Family"" about the average $100,000/year family and how
it disintegrated. Of course a lot of time was spent zooming on Lance, the eff-
eminate gay son and his antics. This was exactly when I was just admitting I was
gay and found it hard to relate to Lance. Of course Boys in the Band, a little
earlier helped keep alive the negative ""self hating"" stereotypes unless the
viewer could read between the retrace lines. A gay person could watch the movie
and maybe see someone he knew or just laugh it off. The straight viewer, on the
other hand had to accept this as Gospel about all of us.
    I can remember the stinkola that ""Cruising"" raised in the gay community. I
have this movie also and have watched it many times. There is a very small elem-
ent of heavy S & M in the gay world and hte movie made this point a few times;
in the opening disclaimor and statements made by the police chief. My roomate
went to see it when it first opened and said a straight couple ran from the 
theatre when the fist fucking scene was shown. It seemed that the only good 
character in the movie was Al Pacino's gay neighbor who gets murdered by his
roomate?????
    Making Love was good but too much got glossed over. I went so see it on
opneing night in Boston and there were as few folks who walked out in disgust
when they showed the young doctor and the writer headed for the bedroom. This
goes along with my mom's thinking, it's ok to be gay but don't let me see two
men being affectionate toward one another. The movie's weak point came toward
the end where all of a sudden *POOF* Zack's divorced and in a long term lover
relationship with a lawyer or doctor. One line that kinda gives us a left handed
slap is where Zack returns to visit his ex wife after a friend's funeral. The
wife makes the statement that she's happy for both of them. A few friends inter-
preted this as saying that Zack could not be happy for himself.....hmmmmm!
    Then there's ""Partners"" with Ryan O'neil and John Hurt as the wimpy closeted
cop who saves the day in the end. I found nothing offensive in this movie but a
few people I know thought it was condescending toward gays. Most of the actors
were pretty realistic and the houswarming party seemed to be just another South
End party, everybody had their clothes on were dancing, drinking, eating, soc-
ializing; not much out of the ordinary. I'm sure we've all seen guys like the
lecherous auntie at the motel desk too.
    The more I look through my library the more I see a gay character being 
subliminally snuck in. In ""The Road Warrior"" I had to see the movie 5 times bef-
ore I realized that the punked out blond who rode with the warrior on the motor-
cycle was his lover. Yeah he got killed, not because he was gay but because he
got inthe way of the Aborigine's boomerang. Then there was ""Midnight Express""
where the was an allusion to a gay lover relationship forming between the Amer-
ican and a Swedish Prisioner. In the book there was a bit more  graphic repres-
entation but the movie kept the fact under wraps. More and more there are gay 
parts. I was watching Twilight Zone last Friday and the last vignette was about
a truck driver who hauls souls to hell. In the story he learns that there are
a lot of folks going to hell who should have gone ot heaven. In the end he's
screening the passengers in the cattle truck as to why they think they're going
to hell. He gets past the murderers, etc and singles out a junkie, old woman,
a regular Joe slob and a gay male for salvation; sets them free! I don't know
but just that one scene made me feel good. Whoever wrote the screenplay at least
did not equate being gay with condemnation.
    As for recent, last few year made for tv stuff, it seems they're making up
for lost time including gay situations and characters. All in the Family, Maude
and Phyllis were probably a couple of the first sitcoms to treat gays in a pos-
itive light as normal. Soap comes along with the only two normal stabilizing 
forces as a Black butler and gay son. Same can be said for Brothers; the gay
brother seeming to be the most normal and well adjusted in the cast. Hollywood
still isn't ready to show the full spectrum of gay life. In an Early Frost it
was ok to show the two lovers walking arm and arm ""Buddy Style"" down any street
U.S.A. I don't think that my mom's ready to see two lovers on tv curling up
together and shutting off the bedroom light yet. It took quite a while for
Blacks to be shown as more than watermellon eating lazy folks, then they were 
all upper crust, now most Black roles run the gamut of criminal to President
of the United States. 
    Over the years I've met a couple of gay men who worked in the Hollywood
movie industry as camera and audio men, wardrobe planners/designers, etc, They
all said that the industry has a much larger than average number of gays working
for the studios but added that the movie industry is one of the most homo-
phobic in the country. It's amazing what is allowed in other genres that are
peddled at the suburban mall cinemas. Take the rash of psycho killer movies
that have been relaesed in recent years; The Friday the 13th series, Halloween
series and now Nightmare on Elm Street. I caught Nightmare on Elm Street on
cable and it about made me gag; there's no sense to the level of violence that
the public gets spoon fed. Paul Newman bought movie rights to The Front Runner
and no one wanted to touch it unless the gay character was replaced with a fem-
ale. That was a few years ago, are we ready now to show a normal college coach

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I started to reply to Keith's posting by answering him line for line,
but my overall point was being lost in the line-by-line debate.  My
point is the following:  I am sick and tired of people stating grandly
on one hand that one must not generalize, and then on the other hand
blasting gay men in the community for being shallow, petty, full of
gossip, catty, et. al.  This type of argument is contradictory,
hypocritical, and divisive. 
Yes, I have seen the cattiness in certain circles.  Yes, I am aware of
the gossip in certain circles.  Yes, I am aware that some gay men have
problems setting goals and thinking about the future.  Yes, I am aware
that some gay men have difficulties having stable relationships (not 
exactly a unique problem considering the current divorce statistics). 
***Yes, I am aware that gay men like this might compose the majority in 
certain gay circles.***
However, to say that these are the traits of the ""gay male community""
is rubbish.  If you believe otherwise, I claim that you are not being
perceptive enough, that you are only seeing what frightens you the
most, what makes you most insecure about your own masculinity, and
what rattles your own conception of what ""men"" or ""gay men"" should be.
On the one hand, you say ""don't generalize.""  On the other hand, you
complain about gay men's ""fish handshakes,"" and you ""point into the
mirror"" to warn us about gossipy queens (do you gossip?  should you 
really have been pointing into a mirror?).  You admire men who avoid the
gay community even when the association ""would clearly be beneficial to the
individual,""  but then you claim to admire lesbians because they are
*more* active (politically) in the gay community (again, another
generalization).  
If you *really* don't approve of generalizations, stop using them to
""prove"" your points. 
<END_OF_FLAME>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me relate two quick stories to prove my point.
I play for a gay men's basketball team in Boston, Massachusetts.  All 
in all, I enjoy their company more than any gay ""group"" I have ever 
encountered (in the bars, in the Boston Alliance of Gay and Lesbian 
Youth, in a gay health club to which I belong, and in the AIDS Action 
Committee).  
For instance, one of my old boyfriends didn't know who Larry Bird was
(player for the Boston Celtics professional basketball
team).  Unlike my old boyfriend, I could really *talk* with these
guys!  Finally, I had found a whole group of gay men who liked sports.
However, I sensed that although these guys were easy going about 
traditionally masculine behavior, they were *very* uptight about 
anything that could be linked to being ""gay.""  Since I have a limited 
reserve of ""Butch-ness,"" this troubled me.
For instance, the first time I came to the gym to play ball with the
guys, I asked if this was the gay basketball group. They all looked at
me nervously; after all, I had said the forbidden ""G"" word.  Time in and
time out, they made it clear that they were (read: ""wanted to be"") just
a bunch of ""guys"" playing basketball.  During one game, a friend
of mine said, ""he's such a lady; there's more Clinique on that
body than is stocked in Filene's department store.""  This line would
have been funny if it weren't accompanied by a vicious ""I'm above all
that"" sneer. 
I get the feeling that these guys would never watch Dynasty, wear
Clinique products, shop in certain stores, listen to Disco music, or
wear 501 jeans because that is ""gay"" behavior.  In my opinion, if you
don't like a product, don't use it; if you don't like a product
because you are worried about what other people think, you are
foolish. 
Story number 2:  
I just finished working out at my health club and I decided to go to 
the Boston Ramrod (gay bar) for a drink (a really healthy thing to do, 
huh?).  When I walked into the bar, I noticed the usual assortment of 
folks (yes, the catty, gossipy people included; after all, they are 
the most noticeable).  
One guy stood out of the crowd.  He was dressed in jeans, leather 
chaps, a ringed harness, and a leather hat.  I thought he looked 
ridiculous!  So, as I drank my beer, I imagined all sorts of sordid 
details about this guy in order to pass the time and to amuse myself.  
After all, I wouldn't be caught *dead* in an outfit like that (except 
on Halloween---ahem).
To my surprise (I *attract* men like that?), the man approached me and
we began to talk.  He explained that he had read that Thursday nights
were ""leather and denim"" nights at the Ramrod, and that he thought that
he would be out of place if he *didn't* dress that way.  He explained
that he worked in Boston's financial district, lived in the 
area, and so forth.  We had an incredibly enjoyable talk.  Not once
did he come-on to me (""you know how promiscuous those leathermen
are""), and as a matter of fact, he expressed his joy that he found
someone with which to pass the time of day. We shook hands (firmly I
might add) and parted friends. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It amazes me the number of people who turn to me to tell me that the
bars are only filled with nasty, gossipy queens.  I wonder if those
people are including themselves in that group; after all, I see them
in the bars, too.  It kind of reminds me of Boston's local cruising
park (where men meet anonymously to have sex); nobody has ever been
there, but they can all give eye-witness accounts of what goes on in
the bushes. 
***You can't generalize***  Under close inspection, generalizations
never describe real people.  We are too complex to fit into rigid 
stereotypes.  If you choose to avoid the gay community, then you are 
missing the opportunity to enjoy a wide variety of people.  
The next time you go into a ""gay"" event, really try to notice the
types of people who surround you.  Especially, take time to notice the
quiet ones.  Appreciate the variety in our community and add your own
personality to the melting pot.  You and your local gay community will
be richer because of it.  Don't discredit the notion of community just 
because you differ from some gay people.  We need to appreciate our 
differences as much as those traits we have in common.
What do others think about this issue?

In answering many of the replies to my posting concerning parents and
coming out, I was reminded of an article I once read by Armistead
Maupin.  The article presents his ""gay"" philosophy of life.  I agree
with *all* points made in the article.  *You* might not agree with
everything, but I hope that you'll find the article interesting! 
Straight folks, bisexual people, and people who hate making
distinctions, replace the word ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" with the appropriate
adjective.  I think that you'll find that the article applies to you
too. 
By the way, KenWatch is taking a vacation until I can finish the next 
chapter of my technical manual.  So far, 8 people are in favor of 
KenWatch (not including myself and my friends at work), and 7 people 
are opposed.  Please send me *personal mail* as to whether you want to 
see future issues of ""Rubbish in Reply to Rubbish.""  Don't waste space 
on the net.  If enough people want it to go away, hey!  I can use the 
spare time!
Sorry to imply that KenWatch was classy, intelligent, and so forth.  Do 
you think I'd waste that much time on Ken Arndt?  AAAAaaahhhhhhaaaa,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Design for Living:  Strengthening the Body Politic Seven Ways
by Armistead Maupin
[Reprinted without permission from the ""Advocate,"" Issue 411, 
January 8, 1985]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Several months ago my friend Timothy Leary gave me some advice about 
my upcoming national book tour. 
""Before you go,"" he suggested, ""figure out exactly what you want to 
say, and don't be embarrassed to say it over and over again.  It may 
be the hundredth time you've said it, but it's the first time they've 
heard it, so make sure you sound like you mean it.  The hundredth time 
is just as important as the first.""
He was right.
Three weeks and 15 cities later, I had summoned up the same answers so 
often that I felt like a cross between Dr. Ruth Westheimer and the 
audio-animatronics Abe Lincoln at DisneyLand.  Most of the questions 
were about my books (""When will Mouse find a lover?"" and ""Didn't you 
kill Connie twice?""  were two of the biggies), but a surprising number 
of them cast me in the role of Coming-Out Consultant, a keeper of the 
mysteries of Happy Homohood.
Remembering Tim's suggestions, I surveyed my most frequent responses 
and discovered the following blueprint for a more fulfilling life.  
Read it once, and I promise I won't bring it up again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Stop Begging for Acceptance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Homosexuality is still an anathema to most people in this 
country---even to many homosexuals.  If you camp out on the doorstep 
of society waiting for ""the climate"" to change, you'll be there until 
Joan Rivers registers Democratic.
Your job is to accept yourself---joyfully and with no apologies--and 
get on with the adventure of your life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Don't Run Away from Straight People.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
They need variety in their lives just as much as you do, and you'll 
forfeit the heady experience of feeling exotic if you limit yourself 
to the company of your own kind.
Furthermore, you have plenty to teach your straight friends about 
tolerance and humor and the comfortable enjoyment of their own 
sexuality. (Judging from ""Donahue,"" many of them have only now begun to 
learn about foreplay; we, on the other hand, have entire resorts built 
around the practice.)
Besides, it's time you stopped thinking of heterosexuals as the enemy. 
It's both convenient and comforting to bemoan the cardboard villainy 
of Jerry Falwell and friends, but the real culprits in this melodrama 
are just as queer as you are.
They sleep with you by night and conspire to keep you invisible by 
day.  They are studio-chiefs and bank presidents and talk-show hosts, 
and they don't give a damn about your oppression because they've got 
their piece of the pie, and they got it by living a lie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Refuse to Cooperate in the Lie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not your responsibility to ""be discreet"" for the sake of people 
who are still ashamed of their own natures.  And don't tell me about 
""job security.""  Nobody's job will ever be safe until the general 
public is permitted to recognize the full scope of our homosexual 
population.  
Does that include teachers?
You bet it does.  Have you forgotten already how much it hurt to be 14 
and gay and scared to death of it?  Doesn't it gall you just a little 
that your ""discreet"" lesbian social-studies teacher went home every 
day to her lover and her cats and her Ann Bannon novels without once 
giving you even a clue that there was hope for your own future?
What earthly good is your discretion, when teen-agers are still being 
murdered for the crime of effeminacy?
I know, I know---you have a right to keep your private life private.  
Well, you do that, my friend--but don't expect the world not to notice 
what you're really saying about yourself.  And the rest of us.
Lighten up, Lucille.  There's help on the way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Stir Up Some Shit Now and Again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Last spring I wrote a commentary for the ""Los Angeles Times"" on the 
subject of television's shoddy treatment of homosexuality.  The piece 
originally contained a sentence to the effect that ""it's high time the 
public found out there are just as many homosexuals who resemble 
Richard Chamberlain as there are who resemble Richard Simmons.""
The editor cut it.  When I asked him why, he said: ""Because it's 
libelous, that's why.""
To which I replied: ""In the first place, I'm not saying that Richard 
Chamberlain is gay; I'm simply saying there are plenty of gay men who 
resemble him.  In the second place, even if I were saying that Richard 
Chamberlain is gay, it wouldn't be a libelous remark, because I'm gay 
myself and I don't say those things with malice.  I don't *accuse* 
anyone of being gay; I state it as a matter of fact or opinion.""
Three years earlier, I confronted a similar problem with an editor at 
the ""New York Times"" who forbade me to make reference in an essay to 
""gay film writer Vito Russo"" without some written proof from Vito---an 
affidavit, no less---that he was in fact, one of *those*.
I asked the editor if the ""Times"" took similar precautions when 
mention was made of black or Jewish people.  Surely there are plenty 
of Americans who would hate to be mistaken for black or Jewish, so why 
isn't their bigotry protected by the strong arm of the newspaper libel 
law?
""Because,"" said the editor, ""it's just not the same thing.""
And they're doing their damnest to keep it that way.  When the new 
city of West Hollywood assembled its council last month, the 
Associated Press identified the three openly gay members as ""admitted 
homosexuals.""  Admitted, get it?  Fifteen years after the Stonewall 
Rebellion, the wire service wants to make it perfectly clear that 
homosexuality is still a dirty little secret that requires full 
confession before it can be mentioned at all.
If you don't raise some hell, that isn't going to change.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Don't Sell your Soul to the Gay Commercial Culture
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, go ahead, if you insist, but you'd better be prepared to accept 
the Butt Plug as the cornerstone of Western Civilization.
I am dumbfounded by the number of bright and beautiful men out there 
who submerge themselves completely in the quagmire of gay ghetto life, 
then wonder why their lives seem loveless and predictable.
What the hell did they expect?
If you have no more imagination than to swap one schlock-heavy 
""lifestyle"" for another, you haven't learned a god-damned thing from 
the gay experience.
I'm not talking about sex here; I'm talking about old-fashioned bad 
taste.
No, Virginia, we *don't* all have good taste.  We are just as 
susceptible to the pit falls of tackiness as everyone else in the 
world.  Your pissing and moaning about the shallowness of *other* 
faggots falls on deaf ears when you're wearing a T-shirt that says 
""This face seats five.""
Not long ago I sat transfixed before my TV screen while an earnest 
young man told a gay cable announcer about his dream of becoming Mr. 
Leather Something-or-Other.  He was seeking the title, he said, ""in 
order to serve the community and help humanity.""  He wore tit rings 
and a codpiece and a rather fetching little cross-your-heart harness, 
but he sounded for all the world like a Junior Miss contestant from 
Medesto [California].
If our fledging culture fails us, it will be because we forgot how to 
question it, forgot how to laugh at it in the very same way we laugh 
at Tupperware and Velveeta and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Stop Insulting the People You Love by Assuming They Don't Know 
    You're Gay.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When I began my book tour, a publicist in New York implored me to 
leave his name out of it, because ""my family doesn't know about 
my...uh, lifestyle.""
Maybe not, but they must be the dumbest bunch this side of Westchester 
County [New York]; I could tell he was gay *over the telephone*.
When my own father learned of my homosexuality (he read it in 
""Newsweek""), he told me he'd suspected as much since I'd been a 
teen-ager.  I could've made life a lot easier for both of us if I'd 
had the guts to say what was on my mind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Learn to Feel Mortal.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If AIDS hasn't reminded you that your days are numbered---and always 
have been---then stop for a moment and remind yourself.  *Your days 
are numbered, Babycakes*.  Are you living them for yourself and the 
people you love, or are you living them for people you fear?
I can't help thinking of a neighbor of mine, a dutiful government 
employee who kept up appearances for years and years, kept them up 
until the day he died, in fact--of a heart attack, in the back row of 
an all-male fuck film.
Appearances don't count for squat when they stick you in the ground 
(all right, or scatter you to the winds), so why should you waste a 
single moment of *your* life seeming to be something you don't want to 
be?
Lord, that's so simple.  If you hate your job, quit it.  If your 
friends are tedious, go out and find new ones.  You are *queer*, you 
lucky fool, and that makes you one of life's buccaneers, free from the 
clutter of 2.000 years of Judeo-Christian sermonizing.  Stop feeling 
sorry for yourself and start hoisting your sails.  You haven't a 
moment to loose.

Next week on ""I Don't Wanna Know"" Jason on Public Sex - A Double Standard (a)
(a) This will be real posting, maybe a bit more than a week away
================================================================================
               Jason Attempts Answering More Cosmic Gay Questions
                                      Or
                           ""Why'd Ya Do Watcha Did?""
    I got quite a few responses to the ""It Ain't Pretty"" posting, what was
surprising was that all of the respondants concurred with my article and 
admitted to having same feelings. This is interesting since in person many may
have changed the subject or told me to stick it in my ear. This could be in
part to the semi anonymity that a computer link affords. Many are more willing
to share inner feelings to a total stranger then to their closest friends. This
is almost like an electronic confessional in a way with the priest seated behind
a terminal on one coast and the confessor on the opposite coast. Last year a gay
man sent me personal mail to say he enjoyed the Jason postings. He went on at
length to tell me he had contracted AIDS and shared all of his personal fears
and hopes for the future. He was a read only subscriber who has long since left
the network. I carried on a dialogue with him until he told me he was too sick
to continue working and bid me goodbye. I was glad at least that he had the love
and support of his employer, family and friends from what he told me. But! the
total purpose of this newsgroup is not *just* for emotional and spiritual cath-
arsis; I've enjoyed may articles written by others on subjects ranging from
Gay Parenting, What people do over the holidays, AIDS research, Gay music, gay
this and gay that. Through pen/keyboard pals I've learned what gay life is like
in other countries as well as other parts of the United States. Many non gay
readers have sent me mail saying that life on the single heterosexual side of
the tracks is no different then on our side. This has been (for me) a forum of
understanding (Arndtism aside) and I hope it continues to be so in the future.
Even Ken may be looking for answers, although in an unorthadox manner. None of
us can read the other poster's minds, only what we see on our screens.
    Well! before I diverge from the subject any further, let me get back on 
track....lemmee see, where was I? As I said before, many have shared (in priv-
ate) feelings that I have put before the group. I'm not looking for cheap
psychotherapy but since my minor in college was ""Psych"" I've always had a keen
interest in what makes people tick and have observed various behaviors pretty
closely. What I've come up with is that most of us act fairly rational in our
everyday lives; when it comes to matters of the heart then many of us go a 
little squirrely, behave irratioanlly, etc.
    I had mentioned that I'm much more warmly received in heterosexual groups
than in gay ones even though most of these people know that I'm gay. Maybe
because I act masculine and have *butch* hobbies they consider me one of the
guys, maybe they're just a bunch of well adjusted heterosexuals who feel sec-
ure in themselves enough to know I'm not a threat. Straight people on the whole
tend to be less insecure than we are. Sure! why not! they are the status quo
and don't have as much to worry about as far as being accepted goes. I have seen
some of the most disgustingly ugly fat straight men who had very positive images
of themselves,""I'm a good looking dude!"" that were popular and made out with the
women like a Tomcat in heat. I've also seen some of the most incredibly great
looking gay men who felt they weren't worthy of ever hoping to be liked, let
alone loved! When ""Small Town Boy"" by Bronski Beat came out I could identify
with the lyrics, ""Pushed around and kicked around, always the lonely boy"" I
allowed the hatred of my peers to become my own self hatred. When I looked in
the mirror I saw an awfully ugly person as years went by. After coming out I
expected acceptance but found out that gays can be just as rejecting of their
own as the homophobes are of them; I felt even uglier. I'm just now learning
to go easier on myself and say, ""you're not a bad looking person at all and
talented to boot, despite what they think"". 
    The insecurity in gay men can come across as jealousy of others, resulting
in attitude and catty behavior to the object of their envy. Of course you'll
never know that hte other person wishes he was you or had your traits. He may
dish or in other ways discount you as a person in front of others. In this way
he can attract more attention to himself. One thing I have learned about gay
social groups/circles is that there is already an unspoken pecking order. There
may be an inner circle of kingpins who bask in attention. Now I or some new
comer show up and the fun begins. They may take an instant liking to me or rej-
ect my presence. If they see that I don't pose a threat to the status quo or
that I would compliment/enhance their attractiveness, then I may be asked to
join in. On the other hand if I seem to be overly attractive in their eyes
and they feel that I may steal some of their fire, they will ignore/reject
the fact that I'm there. They may even circulate through the crowd whispering
subtle warnings about me to their friends. This will help assure that no one
actually finds out that I could be in fact, a very nice person. Let me give 
you a couple of true, real life experiences I've had. I'll bet many of you
have been on both ends of these scenarios.
    I used to hang out at a local gay bar until I learned how the clientel
acted. The place attaracted the same basic crowd every week with a few out of
towners passing through on weekends. Most of the regulars knew each other so
gossip was common. All of a sudden I was aware that I wasn't welcome; the 
doorman started hassling me, I had a hard time getting served and when I walk-
ed through the bar it was like Moses parting the Red Sea as the crowd moved
aside and stared as I passed. After a while I got quite concerned and since
I was kinda friendly with the manager I asked to chat with him in private. We
got together after closing time and I voiced my concerns. He asked me if I was
into kinky sex to which I said no and questioned why he was asking this. I found
out a heavy rumor had started that I was into heavy S & M and had a torture
chamber in my apartment. I also suppposedly had sent a couple of guys to th
hospital. The manager asked me to be honest, ""do you have AIDS?"" geeeze no
wonder people were running away, I had become an AIDS infected dungeon master!
I got furious at hearing this and asked who started the rumor!! He said to the
best of his knowledge there were a few guys who thought I was a real hunk and
wanted to go to bed with me. Since I had never noticed anyone eyeing me and took
action on it, they interptreted this as a rejection. The rational of their act-
ions was, ""well he's too stuck up to talk with me. Well I'll fix him! If I can't
have him then no one else will either!"" This is one of the most vicious things
some jaded queen can ever pull on another person and it's quite common among
a lot of gay circles...petty jealousy turned into hatred. I never found out who
the people were that started the rumors, just as well since I may have started
indulging in heavy S & M with a certain few men.
    In another case I had been invited to attend a new gay social group's meet-
ing. Right from the start I fit right in and felt welcome. A lot of the members
said that they thought I was a welcome change and addition to the group. I beg-
an chairing a few meetings, then something went wrong, everyone started pulling
away. I was left in the corner all of a sudden and again started wondering what
was happening. I found out that the founder of the group, who's house we met at
had started some ugly rumors about me.....why? One night I dropped in on him
and of course he had nothing to say, wanted me to leave. I took him by the 
shoulders and pushed him up against the wall, demanding to know what his problem
was, then I'de leave. He broke down crying and said that he was afraid I was go-
ing to become the center of attention, that everyone liked me and a few wanted
to sleep with me. The guy was a real hunk and had enjoyed the limelight until
now. He also said that he wanted to go to  bed with me which I found flattering.
I asked why he just didn't come out and talk with me directly. His reply was
that he didn't want to get rejected. this one eneded up happier; I spent the
night with him and had a wonderful time. The two of us agreed that we would co-
chair the next meeting on Jealousy and childish gay insecurities and how they
destroy our solidarity. He and I went on to become friends as well as fuck bud-
dies until he moved to L.A.
    The last case is a very close friend who I'm just beginning to understand
after 7 years. Ever since we became close he would compete with me on every sub-
ject we discussed. If I said I had a nice dinner, he had one that was 10 times
better, If I met a hot guy and slept with him, I wouldn't get the first sentence
out and he's be telling me how he almost scored with a perfect 10! He asked to 
see my Jason articles and said that no one would be interested in reading them,
he could do better. The funny thing is that this poor guy hasn't really accom-
plished anything spectacular in his life. He's a wonderful guy but one of the
most insecure people I know. Everything I did became a challenge to him; what 
was even worse at the time was that I discovered he was in love with me and
felt because I didn't acknowledge and act on his erotic attraction that I was
now an opponent on the erotic field of competition. At times he would admit to
being envious of things I had done, the men I had dated and my looks/body. I
have often told him, ""you have to be happy with yourself, you're a good person.
You can't be me and probably wouldn't want to if you were."" To this day he
still carries on in rut of inertia, still competes in his own mind. I can't
stop him, only he can become self confident enough so that we compliment one
another and are not in a constant state of petty competition. I wish there were
more gay men like my last roomate; a self confident, friendly person who has no
time for petty gay games. The two of us never competed or felt the need to gos-
sip behind one another's backs. We were both open in introducing each other to
our friends. I know there are many other well adjusted, self confident, polite
and openly friendly gays out there, but so far they have eluded my field of
vision.
    I was raised a Catholic and a Christian. As a boy I never understood the
reasoning behind many actions that we bill as ""sins"". I just knew that for
some reason jealously, covetous behavior, lieing, gossiping and all the catty
stuff a lot of people wallow in was a no no in God's eyes. I think I have a
better understanding now, not just because God doesn't approve but because it
drasticly reduces our ability to interact as brothers and sisters down here on
the planet. We must rise above the petty bickering as gay people, lest we all
drown in our own shit. In my earlier posting I mentioned speaking to a couple
of straight Black friends. Blacks have suffered a common oppression, if they
spent all their time leaving one another out because so and so was too black
or someone was afriad that someone else might become too popular, there might
not have been a Martin Luthor King Jr, there might not be Blacks in management
positions or blacks in government, etc, etc. They share a common bond of racial
heritage as well as a history of pain and discrimination. The building I work
in has many Black employees. What I notice is that whoever they are, they are
always friendly to one another, greeting, smiling and chatting as they pass;
even to s newcomer. This is not just at work since I have been the only white
at black house parties and social functions. There was warmth and acceptance,
even to me who felt out of place but was encouraged to fit right in.
    On the other hand we as gay men and women are not a bonefide ""minority""
therefore not taken seriously. I have yet to apply for a job where a question
on the application (right there with race, creed, nationality) is sexual pref-
erance: Check one | | Straight | | Bisexual | | Gay | | Other please state.
We have no real reason to stick together other than our common oppression and
the fact that we make love withsame sexed members. Richard Pryor made a state-
ment on stage that gay liberation was the right to suck cock! I'll tell you,
if I were heterosexual that's what I'de think on the surface! To me I'de like
it to be more; not having to fear physical harm for being gay, not fearing loss
of job or apartment, being shown the same respect as any other tax paying Amer-
icans and being able to point to the crowd marching down the street on Gay Pride
day proclaiming, ""These are my brothers and sisters, all united"". Of course
someone may shout out of the crowd, ""you're not my brother or friend, go away
I heard you're bad news"". Well, actually one guy may whisper to another, ""ppssst
see the guy with the video camera, stay away from him, I hear he fucks dogs and
cats"". This of course is as it stands now.
    Lookism is a real problem in our community and a major contributor to the
in/out crowd syndrome. Now be honest kids, how many of you have been at a bar or
party and this much older, not very attractive person stands next to you; does-
n't say or do anything, just stands there and you all of a sudden decide to move
I'll bet you didn't feel comfortable around him because you were afraid someone
may think he's with you. How many times have you been chatting with someone you
may not find attractive and all of a sudden a friend walks in, you turn and
totally disregard the person you've been talking to; afraid of what your friend
might say about your choice of company. Aw c'mon I know a lot of you, especially
you young whippah snappahs can identify with this. Well! it's just not polite,
they're just as gay as you and deserve the same recognition as you get. You may
be old and not so pretty some day. Remember what hte Bible says, ""Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you"". What this boils down to is don't trash oth-
ers unless you're a masochist and enjoy it yourself. If being snubbed hurts your
feelings don't pass it on to the next guy. The bitchiness buck keeps getting 
passed on and on and on in the gay world and there's no excuse for it. Stop and
think about it for a while, someone gets hurt and you may look like a little
shining, slightly tarnished star. Your friends may approve but deep down I'll
bet they don't trust you and would not think twice of trashing you.
   Along thee lines of ""Do unto others"" is the prejudgment of a new face. Ok 
you see a wonderously handsome guy wno you want to get to know, you fromulate
your witty introduction while wiping your sweaty palms on your jeans, then
decide, what the hell! why bother! he probably a snob and a jerk! You walk 
away always holding on to the opinion that Mr Hunk is a jerkoff, and you pass
this information on to friends. What gets accomplished; you have insulated your-
self from the possible hurt of rejection and made yourself look good in your
mind's eye, you have passed up the possability of a hot night in bed or at least
making a new chum, have polarized others against this person even though you
know nothing more than he's gorgeous, you have in subtle ways hurt further gay
solidarity as a group and you have passed the bitchiness buck once again.
    Why not just go up and say ""Hi"" I don't think he'll pull a gun out and shoot
you (although from the bulge in his jeans he's carrying some kinda weapon:-) for
saying hello. The worst thing that he could do is walk away or say something
trite in passing by. What gets hurt....your pride, not gay pride but your own
selfish pride.
    The good looking get ignored, snubbed and gossiped about just as much as the
less attractive, better beleive it boys! I dated a guy once who worked as a mod-
el for a big agancy in New York. Ya know what, he asked why a good looking guy
like me saw anything in him....aw! c'mon gimmee a break. Even though this guy
was an absolute 10 (shhhh be still my heat); had a body Naulilus would kill for,
the face of an angel, the dicka death and the charisma of a rock star....he felt
he was ugly! So here we are walking hand in hand wondering why the other saw any
ting in us; needless to say the relationship was short lived. I lter learned 
that most guys wouldda killed to go out with him but figured they were not wor-
thy to bask in his shadow, therefore he was avoided like the plague. What laid
beneath the face, muscles and everything else was a very sweet, quiet and shy
person who had been labeled as a snob.
    I've run into many men in non threatening envoronments who actively snubbed
me at gay bars and parties. Once they got to chatting with me they admitted to
having me figured all wrong. They were under the impression in the bar that
because I was muscular and dressed the part of the hot clone, that I was un-
approachable, therefore a jerk! What they found in private, away from their
friends is that I'm pretty laid back, open, soft spoken and friendly. What we
must all do is give each other a chance instead of pronouncing the verdict of
""guilty"" before having all the facts on a person. If the American judicial
system worked like the gay social mileiu does, everyone would be in prison, with
no hope of parole.
    I can usually tell fairly easy if a person is a snob and jerk. Their haughty
behavior will give them away. If the tall dark stranger is just kinda quiet and
alone he's probably just that ""quiet and alone"" with no airs or affectations. I
cannot see labeling a guy as arrogant or stuck up, just because he's the lone
wolf or outsider, but many do.
    To put somebody else down or make them feel unwelcome as a way of making
ourselves feel better is a cheap shot. Those of you who may do it should stop
and think for a while about how secure you feel about yourself. This can be a
hard and painful process. You may find out that you don't really have any good
friends, that you don't think you're worth knowing yourself, etc. Take a minute
to  examine the reasons you reject/snub others. What is it about them that you
don't like; are you envious of their looks, career, personality or anything
else? If you are, then stop right there before attempting to sabotage their
success in a situation. What's at stake; your pride, your own shaky position
on the social totem pole, your likability, etc? Do some emotional houseclean-
ing on yourself before you attack someone else. As thge Bible also says, ""let
he who is without sin cast the first stone"". This is a very hard thing to do
without some serious thinking on your own part. Ok everybody....drop the rocks!
    Before closing I'de like to talk briefly about why gay men seem to surround
themselves (especially the younger ones) with guys who they feel will make them
look good. Beauty is only skin deep but it sure turns a lotta heads. Underneath
we're all made of the same blood, guts and bones that psycho horror flicks enjoy
splattering on the screen....not very pretty at all...yech! We all posess an
immortal soul (which some would sell for some looks) and a common humanity. We
also share our gayness and sensitivity. Gays are among some of the most sensit-
ive, empathetic and polite people in human services. As waiters, health workers
and other public servants they are the friendliest. So! why not treat your gay
brothers even better, regardless of their looks or what others have told you.
A gay hairdresser may treat an ugly old bag lady with more respect then some-
one he's introduced to who's nose may not be the right shape. I chose my few
friends on content and character, not on slick packaging. Many guys are able
to get by on looks alone and lack any social etiquette whatsoever. They are
the ones who will surround themselves with an entourage of pretty men who are
as shallow as themselves. I'm not generalizing, I've just seen it too many
times to write it off as a delusion. Needless to say I'm not involved with
the beautiful who's looks will pass. I'm dieing to see what they have left
when the final curtain of old age falls. 
     Going back to the Gay Pride March I notice that this is one day a year in
Boston where everybody acts like brothers and sisters. There's a lot of hugging
and and comaraderee. People who act like I was found under a rock the rest of
the year treat me like a long lost friend. Why can't we act like this toward
one another 365 days a year, regardless whether the other guy is Black, older,
not terribly attractive or whatever other flaw he has. We're all flawed in one
way or another. As a non recognized minority we have to stick together and open-
ly embrace the new gay face seeking acceptance and commradeship. This will take
a lot of work and I don't really expect to see it happen for quite a while. As
a group we have a lot of neuroses to get over and a lot of growing up to do.
Gay women complain to me that gay men are too flighty, irresponsible, and phony,
gay men complain that the dykes are taking over the bar. I agree with the gay
women. C'mon children lets get over the irrational judgements and bickering;
if we don't we all go down together.....

success rate was less than spectacular).  We'd meet, dance, go home and screw,
etc.  If I slept with the same guy more than once within a short time span, then
I'd feel justified in at least entertaining thoughts of romance (not that I was
ever into these whirlwind affairs that seem so common).  I also wouldn't chase
after someone who was clearly just sleeping around, since my assumption would be
that he's just interested in sex and not in romance.  (Nothing wrong with that,
just not what I wanted.)
Now, however, the tables are turned, the rules have changed (at least mine have,
for a variety of reasons), and I'm following a more traditional (dare I say 
heterosexual) approach to dating.  Unfortunately, I never bothered to learn how
to date back when I was in school.
First, I wonder how gay men react to dating someone who is also dating others. 
Currently, I'm a little reluctant to give totally honest excuses such as ""I
can't go with you Friday because I already have another date"".  I guess I'm not
quite used to the idea of ""dating many, sleeping with none"", and I'm afraid that
my friends will share this confusion and turn it into distrust or dismissal.
Second, how does one turn a platonic friendship into a romantic relationship?
Or perhaps a better question is how long should it take?  I'm so used to 
sex first that part of me is very impatient, while the more rational parts of me
are torn between the risks of moving too quickly and the risks of moving too 
slowly. 
I apologize for making this so personal, but it seemed the best way to provide
context.  I hope this will turn into a general discussion of dating and changing
social practices of gay men, and not into a session of amateur psychoanalysis.

Summary:
	Dating - one or more people, friends or ""strangers"", open, nonsexual.
	Steady - one person, sexual, no dating, live apart (well, weekends
		and such deserve a bit of sharing living quarters!)
	Partners - ""Married"".  Whatever this may mean to the people involved.
		Financial sharing, living quarters usually shared.

-------------------------DISCLAIMER: ""gay"" vs ""Gay""--------------------------
I admit much of this may seem based on traditional het styles.  I did not
set out to mimic.  I am not ashamed to be ""straight"" in some ways.  It's
a topic for another note, but the Gay fad for being snooty about all that
is heterosexually traditional bugs the h*ll out of me.  Being ""Gay"" is a
style as being ""straight acting"" is a style.  Being gay sexually doesn't
mean I have to be Gay in my choice of food, entertainment, cars, sports,
or political opinions.  Or my style of dating.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With all this ado said and done, comments are invited.  I hope having a
solid model to work from is useful.
 
I've answered one of the original question but failed to shed light on how one
starts dating a friend.  Except that it is perhaps a natural process of seeing
someone regularly; it also requires being un-male-like honest about growing
feelings.

dated men (until I met my mate) and feel it is the best and most logical way
to proceed in a relationship that might take a romantic direction. I really
never got a bad reaction from anybody, but I think Sacramento is more oriented
to that type of thing than larger, more highly populated areas (I just moved
to Pittsburgh; I'm not from here).
In answer to the first question, I don't think anybody should have to apologise
if they wish to date. For that matter, why should anybody apologise for how he
(or she) runs his social life as long as he doesn't hurt anybody else? 
Especially if the constraints are upon oneself. I found a lot of people used to
make me feel guilty about not going to bed with them. Then I realised, what the
hell should I feel guilty about that for? They don't need me for that, and I
have no obligation to them in that regard. So I did what I thought was right,
and if they didn't like it, tough. That was their problem, not mine. But those
who were truely my friends remained so. And it's only silly if you choose it
to be so.
As far as when an intimate relationship should begin, I would say it depends
upon the two individuals involved, and what your goals are. There is
nothing wrong with discussing the issue; it can save a whole lot of confusion.
Discuss your feelings, how you feel about each other. Nothing is 100% certain,
after all. When you both feel the time is really right (based on more than
horneyness) then it undoubtedly will be.
I'm glad this was brought up. For a while, I thought I was the only one who
thought dating was a good idea. I used to hear all this junk about how only
heterosexuals date and we can't/shouldn't do what they do. I think that's
bull. Besides, the attitude that ""just because they do it, it's wrong"" doesn't
hold water. It's like them saying something similar about us. I'm curious

What about a simple, ""Sorry, I have plans for Friday, how about Saturday?""
Or even ""Sorry, I am getting together with a friend Friday, how about
Saturday?"" [BTW, I thinks it's crucially important to offer an alternative
lest the other person think you are indirectly saying ""no"".] The other person
may conclude that you MIGHT be dating someone else, but so what - you're not
near being ""steady"" yet.

I think the use of ""platonic friendship"" might mislead us from the issue.
Are we talking about becoming sexual with good friends, or are we talking
about when to first have sex with a new romantic interest?  I think you
meant the latter.
My advice is that you have to learn from experience what
is right for you. I know that for myself, there has to be a physical attraction
from the start as well as a non-physical interest in the person. If there is
insufficient non-physical interest, nothing will develop after we have sex,
and after the sex is no longer ""mysterious"" with him, my interest in seeing him
will decrease rapidly. If there is insufficient physical attraction, I will
quickly become disinterested in the sex, and the relationship with end unless
he is interesting enough non-physically to be a ""platonic"" friend.
The only point at which TIMING of the first sex is important is that there
is enough interaction beforehand that I get to know if/how he is
non-physically interesting to me. This is important because this interest
is necessary for me to sustain romantic feelings just in case the sex winds
up just so-so.
I know that since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, I have been more interested
in ""dating"" with the goal of ""settling down"" with someone. However, speaking
health-wise, sex in the context of a ""relationship"" is no safer than
""recreational"" sex unless the two of you have had sex with no one else in
the past five or so years.","kXT4-cARIZsJ",9,1986-01-09,6,17

I mean talk about cold chills and hot flashes and goin' numb.  It was like
I could actually SEE all those paintings of future generations of the Arndt

and light up the neighbor's damm dog on full auto with my HK 91!  But thank
goodness I've been a motss reader and have developed FEELINGS and stuff for
those with sexual perferences, eh?  So instead of giving in to visions of
my little lamb in the Ramrod Bar on Policeman's Night ( did you see CRUSING?)
I took direct corrective action.
Realizing his confusion was the result of the pernicious influence of 'MOM'
(the luscious lady who keeps me straight) and his sisters I sat him down for
a Saturday morning in front of the telly with G.I. Joe cartoons (much more
effective than Masters of the Universe).  And I let him beat the kitten to
death.  I'm happy to report he's back on track (I even promised him a puppy
next year to replace kitty).
Quick thinkin', eh?  
But what I'd like to know is what else could I have done???  I mean what have
some of you experienced from family, friends, your top??  Anything that was
effective?  And if not, why not.  Anyone out there who skated away from the
'thin ice'??  How about in 50 words or less, 'I'm not a fag because . . . .'
(Now don't go balistic on me because I used that word among friends!)  Did they
try and feed you those hot Italian peppers, get you braces, bribe the baby
sitter???  
I've seen a little on the net about this topic but I suspect that there is
a whole untold story floating around out there.  Let's hear some success
stories from both sides.  Not that I'll need any more ideas, I'm sure that
by the time my son is three he'll have forgotten all about it.

Hey, Ken --
	You know a lot of kids go through that, and it means that
that they are neither homosexual nor transsexual.  How old is your
son?  My younger brother, when he was about 5, cried when he found
out he couldn't have a baby.  He's eighteen now, and about as
heterosexual as they come.  It just happens as children grow up
that they start feeling curious about the other sex.  There's nothing
at all to be concerned about.

	I am assuming that you are not serious here, about much of 
everything.  You know as well as anyone else here that a woman or
women in a boy's life does not turn him into a woman.  If you are
really encouraging sadistic behavior like this from your children,
I feel terribly sorry for them to be under your influence.   Still,
I would make it a strong bet that you weren't serious.

Fact:  when I was a child, being brought up by two happily married
       heterosexual parents, I was told there was nothing wrong
       with being gay.  I never questioned that, and I still don't.
Fact:  my father's best friend, a man I grew to deeply love and respect,
       was gay.  He never once tried to pick me up, counsel me into being
       gay, or anything else of the like.  He recently died of AIDS at
       age 49.
Fact:  a regular babysitter for me and my syblings was a lesbian.  She,
       too, never tried to influence me or my sister or my two brothers
       into being gay.  In fact, it was not until recently that I learned
       she was a lesbian (I'm 23).  She, too, grew very close to me
       and my family.
Fact:  I am and continue to be heterosexual.  So are the rest of my syblings.
In other words, environments permissive toward homosexuality do not
necessarily encourage it.  I have never felt any need to be gay,
nor am I likely to.  Do not worry about your son.  Encouraging
""masculine"" behavior as described above is likely to do a lot more
harm than good.  This is a great opportunity for you to tell him
about the difference between sexes -- it's a good lesson for him
(I am assuming he is quite young by your references to the cartoons).
I don't know what ""keep chargin'"" means, but I return to you the 
same greeting.

The best way to keep from getting AIDS is to sit down and keep your
mouth shut.
The point, not missed by the great unwashed masses, about all the AIDS
""information/education"" is those little terms 'no evidence to date', it
seems that', there is no sign of . . . ' that betray that NO ONE REALLY
KNOWS FOR SURE the full extent of the vectors for AIDS.
I don't TRUST the doctors, government authorities, etc. as far as I can
throw them.  Do you???  (Remember Swine Flu?)  Not that they are trying 
to fool us, but it's just that I get the uneasy feeling everyone is trying
to calm things down and are they telling us what they think we need/want
to hear or what they really believe to be the case?  In effect they are
really saying, ""we don't know"" to the questions about how it spreads, etc.
Sure we know some, but for instance we now know that the blood tests are
not as good as once stated for safeguarding the nation's blood supply.  What
else are we going to find out, eh?  I mean after they told us to not take
precautions with kids in school, food handlers, insects, etc.
The above, I think, is the reason there is still much concern about contracting
AIDS on the part of 'low risk groups' - the great unwashed masses.  Does anyone
else feel uneasy about the pronouncements from the 'experts'??
What about the issue, coming to the fore with smokers, of employment of 
people who take health risks that will cause their employers money for
health care????  If 'high risk groups' are identified (just like smokers)
will employers not hire them for the above reason and if so is that fair?
Anyone care to look into the crystal ball vis a vis homosexuals???  (Someone
can ask Ron Rizzo for me since he doesn't read my postings but manages to
address them and not mention my name - sex with women 'unnatural' indeed, a
great reply to my postings.)

That's funny, Ken.  You expect the rest of the world to trust such
authorities blindly when you quote them to support your viewpoint and then
say ""See?"".  The moral?  Only believe authorities who tell you what you

Nonoxynol-9 is a mild detergent used in spermicides and various
other ""feminine hygiene"" products to prevent pregnancy and V.D.
It works by bursting the outer protein cap of sperm and various
disease organisms.  In laboratory tests, this detergent quickly
and effectively kills herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, CMV, yeast,
trichomonas, and amoebas.  Most recently, it also has been found
to kill AIDS virus easily in the test tube.  This is promising
news, however nonoxynol-9 is considerably more effective under
laboratory conditions than in actual sexual use because:
a.) The inert ingredients in spermicides -- foams, gels, and
creams -- do not always spread evenly or form a sufficient
chemical barrier for nonoxynol-9 to kill pathogens before they can
reach uninfected tissue.
b.) People often use spermicides incorrectly and only when they
""think"" a partner is infected.
c.) People abandon condoms instead of using nonoxynol-9 and
condoms together.
It is very tempting to use nonoxynol-9 as a layer of prevention
against AIDS while engaging in oral sex and anal intercourse.
But make sure spermicides don't irritate your skin, your mouth,
or your rectum.  When in doubt, check with your doctor.  And to
be sure the doctor's really up  on the subject, be well informed
yourself.  (See ""Reading Up On Condoms and Spermicides."")
Studies show that:
1. Nonoxynol-9 has had a very good safety record for 35 years and
has been used by Gays in spermicides and a couple of lubricants
for anal intercourse over the last 7 years without any reports of
problems.  A preliminary study by Bruce Voeller, Ph.D indicates that
the intestines of 50 spermicide anal users were healthy.  Animal
research which studied nonoxynol-9 excretion through the intestines
also showed no abnormalities.  However, spermicides have only been
tested for safe human use on the skin or in the vagina.  The FDA
noted in 1980 that spermicides are regularly swollowed during
oral sex.  Because of their extremely low toxicity and because
nonoxynol-9 is used as a wetting agent in foods, the FDA deemed
spermicides safe when eaten in small quantities.
2. Spermicides provide very important protection from common STD
transmission if used properly and every time a person has
intercourse (remember, the testing on spermicides and AIDS s
incomplete).  However, the effectiveness drops quickly from 90%+
to 70% or less effectiveness when not used exactly as instructed
on the label.
3. Spermicides and condoms used together and correctly result in
much greater disease prevention than either technique alone.
4. At this point not enough is known about the effect of nonoxynol-9
on human intestines (especially during sex) or about AIDS virus to
recommend spermicides totally without reservation for anal sex OR
to recommend strongly against them!  But they are certainly
recommended for vaginal intercourse as a layer of AIDS prevention
(provided a person is not allergic to them -- remember that
changing brands usually takes care of this problem).","9pLhaEH0yzAJ",23,1985-12-04,2,15

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

Of course, the recommendation to avoid exchanging bodily fluids only
makes sense if either or both haven't been absolutely monogamous for the
past 5 or 6 years.  But even today's good boys and girls might not have
been in such a covetable position for that entire period--if one interprets
the recommendations strictly, even a single ""unsafe"" sexual experience since
1980 is enough to no longer feel 100% assured.
While I think it's great to be monogamous if that's OK with you two, it's
also pretty obvious that these recommendations are directed towards those
who haven't been practicing monogamy.  And that includes a lot more than
those whom you would call promiscuous.

Cheryl, get over it.  Whether you like it or not, AIDS is a disease
that affects everyone, even you.  Will, and I, and Jeff, and anyone
else who post information about AIDS, are simply trying to provide the
latest information so that we can all be around in a couple of years
to keep on trading insults.  Will's information is not from the

available.  As for sending this posting to net.women, you may be
right--Will should have posted it to net.announce and net.general.
And stop posting to net.nlang.africe. The topic is inappropriate for

       ""Amongst	ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank	and

       R-types view themselves

       They  value  highly their acceptance in general society,	and
       many are	careful	to  sustain  friendships  in  the  straight
       community.   Rs	are  proud  of	their manly appearance,	and

       describing themselves as	'bisexual.'
       ""The one	thread connecting the  childhoods  of  Rs  we  have
       interviewed  is	peer  acceptability.  By and large, Rs were
       kids who, for one reason	 or  another,  could  conform  with
       ease,  and  so did. ...	Young Rs, it seems, were only dimly
       aware of	 their	need  for  the	rewards	 of  acceptability,

       sexuality sent a	stunning shock	through	 well-adjusted	Rs.
       ...   Many  boys	 ignored and disguised this discovery until
       they could come to terms	with it.  In the meantime,  teenage
       Rs  struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer
       image.  Even as they grew up to enjoy sex with other boys on
       the  sly, conformism in all other aspects of demeanor became
       the self-exacted	quid pro quo.

       is a homosexual on display.   (He  may  not  always  be	one
       display ... [e.g.] in the presence of family and	employers.)
       On the street, he may assume any	one of the  several  public
       personas	 most  familiar	 to the	straight world:	the pomaded
       and permed 'fem', the titanic leather  master,  the  clipped
       clone,  the  GQ	hyperboy, and others. ...  Qs are outwardly
       gayified; they have bought into strict outgroup	stereotypes
       which, whether screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
       constitute  a  burlesque	 of  gender  roles.   Qs  think	 of
       themselves  as visible gays, and	tend to	make such a profile
       central to their	ego structure. ...
       ""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,  and  Qs	are

       gay ghettos in urban centers. ...
       ""Whereas	Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and	 so
       did, many Qs felt that, for whatever reasons, they could	not

       prettiness, lack	of athletic  skill,  or	 almost	 any  other
       cause   for   unpopularity  among  male	youth.	 At  first,

       anti-conformism.	  So  some  Qs	went further and acquired a
       taste for  outrageousness,  actively  calculating  shock	 to
       others  in  order to reinforce their social status as rebels
       with a cause. ...
       ""As the years go	by, and	they learn that	they are not alone,
       Qs  adopt zealously the visible uniforms	and credos of their
       supporting outgroups. ...  Surveys have shown that, for many
       Qs,  camp  behavior  is	a  passing phase of overt defiance,
       toned down in later years.
       ""When those gays	who boast R-status meet	 those	who  defend
       Q-status, there can be trouble.	First, let's look at things
       for the viewpoint of the	 R.   For  one	thing,	the  sexual
       objects	of  Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs, for the most part
       are scorned. ...	 It is the 'fem' [from among the variety of
       Q-type  personas]  who bears the	brunt of the invective from
       Rs. ...
       ""[Gay] bars are often regarded by  Rs  as  the  bastions	 of
       self-segregated	Qs - branded as	twinkie	bars, leather bars,
       etc. - and so may be viewed with	distaste. ...
       ""We should mention at this point	that those Rs who shun	the
       bars  find it more difficult to lead satisfactory sex lives.
       They have trouble meeting other Rs because,  unlike  visible
       Qs,  out	 in  the  straight  world most Rs have banished	any
       tell-tale signals of  homosexuality  from  their	 conformist
       uniforms	and are	wary of	mistaken self-exposures. ...
       ""To make	sexual matters still more difficult  for  many	Rs,
       they  face two more unique dilemmas. ...	 First,	... a Q	may
       be drawn	to,  and  satisfied  by,  a  relationship  with	 an
       acceptably  masculine  R.   But what of the classic R-type -
       the 'all-American boy' whose only felt  shortcoming  is	his
       sexual  preference?   For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual
       object possessing the one feature  he  feels  he	 lacks	and
       wishes  to  capture - may very well be the straight boy,	who
       is, by definition, unattainable.	...
       ""The second sexual dilemma faced	by Rs involves	the  ritual
       of  sex-play  itself.   For  at	least  some  Rs,  it seems,
       masculine role performance is the  most	thrilling  part	 of
       sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened in homosexual practices
       such as passive anal sex	or active fellatio. ...
       ""But even if the	 R  is	contentedly  'out'  to	family	and
       friends,	 and  self-exposure  is	 not an	issue, he may still
       dislike Qs for two related reasons.
       ""First, because the R has typically conformed with  ease	 to
       the  mainstream,	 the  exaggerated  outgroup  displays of Qs
       simply baffle him.  Why would any person	choose to draw such
       public ridicule and abuse, he wonders? ...  'I don't see	why
       they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
       [we  interviewed].   'It	 obviously looks phony and fools no
       one.' At	best, then, many Rs come to view Qs  the  way  that
       many  straights view homosexuals	en bloc, as somehow foolish
       and trivial, a nationality of sterile cuckoos. ...
       ""Second,	Qs do more than	baffle Rs - they also  irritate	 Rs
       terribly,  to  a	 degree	that more detached straights cannot
       understand.  Many Rs plainly resent  being  identified  with
       the  Qs,	and blame them for the weird profile of	homosexuals
       as a whole. ...
       ""Like most gay males, it	seems,	even  exotic  Qs  hear	the
       siren  call  of	the rutting R.	And so relations between Qs
       and Rs grow still more tense.
       ""It is our impression that, for both Rs and  Qs,	 archetypal
       Rs  the	'idols	of  the	 tribe.'  It is	the R whose natural
       masculine grace tops  the  overall  hierarchy  of  desirable
       traits	in  the	 fierce	 gay  competition  of  good  looks.
       Handsome	Rs often sense this pecking order, and feeds  their
       egos  while  hardening  their disdain for Qs, especially	the
       effeminate ones.	...
       ""Many Qs	may learn from necessity to refocus their libido on
       fellow Qs. ...
       ""For it is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after	the
       R  as  sexual object, they may also resent and reject him as
       social  companion!   There  are	several	 reasons  for  this
       rejections. 'Sour grapes' is an understandable reaction from
       those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
       have  defensively  fashioned  a	lifestyle  out	of peculiar
       individualism are bound to resent (and perhaps envy  just  a
       little)	those  gays  who can and do successfully conform to
       straight	standards. ...	There is more to  Q/R  estrangement
       than just these problems.
       ""For one	thing, if the handsome all-American straight boy is
       the  ultimate  sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-
       type homosexual must appear as a	ghostly	mock-up	of the real
       thing. ...
       ""Further, Rs are	 still	more  upsetting	 to  those  Qs	who
       believe	that  'butch'  behavior	is just	an unnatural put-on
       for gays. ...  Just as the anti-conformity of Qs	baffles	Rs,
       the ease	with which Rs conform to the mainstream	may be hard
       for Qs to understand. ...  Hence, Qs  may  misinterpret	the
       Rs' ingrained disinclination to gayified	behavior, and label
       it homophobia. ...
       ""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type  persona
       as the 'true' gay type, and hence feel like outsiders within
       their own outgroup. ...
       ""How do these tensions between Rs and Qs	affect	the  social
       structures,  political institutions, and	activist success of
       the gay community?  ...	 Those	who  could  not	 hide  have
       instead	turned	to make	their stand against oppression,	and
       Qs have risen to	political leadership and brotherhood in	the
       activist	 movement across America.  This	is to their credit.
       Extreme Qs, as a	group, may rate	below Rs on the	sociosexual
       hierarchy,  but they can	and do rank above them on the scale
       of political power in the gay world.
       ""In  the	 meantime,  reticent  Rs,  who	benefit	 from	the
       sacrifices  of  Qs and yet carp about their flamboyant image
       in the straight world, have been	able to	have it	both  ways:
       they  achieve  personal	acceptability in the right straight
       world of	today, while relishing the progress  toward  social
       flexibility  made on their behalf for tomorrow.	But because
       Rs do not choose	to play	the activist game in great numbers,
       they  lose their	ability, as a group, to	influence the rules
       of that game.
       ""Although the point is hard  to	prove  with  certainty,	 we
       suspect that it is mainly Qs who	organize the gay community,
       set its norms, and decide which of  its	collective  efforts
       are  PC	['politically  correct'].  PC initiatives are those
       which the gay leadership	and press deem to be good  for	the
       gay  community  as  a whole.  And the mobilization of the R-
       type subgroup, it turns out,  is	 definitely  not  PC  -	 at
       least, not in Boston.  Let us give you an example.
       ""Several	years ago, a handful of	 young	men  in	 that  city
       attempted   to  start  an  organization	which  would  bring
       together	self-perceived	Rs  for	 social	 activities.   They
       posted  two  short announcements	in college and local papers
       with the	 headline,  'STRAIGHT  GAYS.'  The  leaders  rather
       crudely	hinted	that this new club would be for	those young
       gays 'not  entirely  comfortable	 with  the  glittering	bar
       crowd.'	One  of	 the  authors  attending the organization's
       first meeting.  He found	the room packed	 with  excited	and
       grateful	 Rs,  who immediately set about	the organization of
       the  club  activities  ranging  from  baseball	to   opera-
       listening.   The	only qualification for membership was self-
       selection according  to	the  understood	 character  of	the
       organization,  and  its	aims  remained	social	rather than
       political. ...  Within weeks, the club was regularly drawing
       to its meetings between one and two hundred members - making
       it one of the most active gay groups  in	 Boston.  ...	Its
       leaders likened the group to the	gay clubs designed to bring
       together	men with  other	 special  interests,  such  as	the
       black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite, or 'man/boy love'
       societies in town.
       ""Boston's  gay  leadership  did	not  buy  the	comparison,
       however.	  There	was evident suspicion and resentment (based
       some part, no doubt, on envy) at	the prospect  of  'student-
       aged'   all-American   Rs   cloistering	 exclusively  among
       themselves for social and sexual	companionship.	A local	gay
       newspaper  attacked  the	group openly for its supposed macho
       snobbery	and for	the 'closet cases' it  seemed  to  nurture.
       ...    The   organization's  leaders  protested	that  their
       intentions had been misunderstood  (although,  in  a  sense,
       they   have  been  all-to-clearly  understood  -	 and  found
       politically incorrect).	But eventually they  bowed  to	the
       pressure.   Over	 two  years  they  gradually phased out	the
       stress upon 'straight gays.'  The  criticism  from  the	gay
       community  stopped  coming.  Alas, so did the group's R-type
       members.	 Having	lost  its  distinctive	drawing	 card,	the
       entire  operation  fizzled.   It	 had  failed the test of PC
       administered by the Q-oriented community. ...
       ""And there is a final twist in the Q/R cold  war	 which	may
       impede  the  growth of gay rights from time to time.  R-type
       gays are	the ones who actually succeed in slipping into	the
       circles	of mainstream political	power in America.  So it is
       a sad irony that	confidential liaisons between uptight Rs in
       government  and	Qs heading the gay activist movement can be
       further	strained  by  the   R's	  basic	  alienation   form
       unconventional Qs in general. ...
       ""This  analysis	has  found  the	 gay  world  troubled	and
       handicapped by the mutual alienation of Qs and Rs.  It is PC
       to deny this split. ...	First, we must abandon PC myths	and
       admit  that  the	 split	exists.	 Second, we must understand
       clearly the root	cause of the Q/R cold  war.   Someone  once
       called  it  'oppression	sickness':  each outgroup member is
       ill-at-ease with	himself, and is	frustrated  by	his  forced
       companions,  because the	social mainstream imposes pressures
       and expectations	which he feels that  he	 cannot	 meet,	and
       because	his  companions	 remind	him of his own failure.	 So
       the more	progress we can	make toward  social  acceptance	 in
       the  straight world for gays as a whole,	the less tension we
       will see	between	groups within the gay world. ...
       ""In the meantime, the gay  community  should  recognize	the
       distinct	identity and special problems of R-type	homosexuals
       - and could begin by expanding the aegis	of PC tolerance	 to
       include R-type organizations.

       chaff of	its own	implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""","VMx87SJctxwJ",8,1985-11-22,-33,17

two polar categories of gay men, based on how they were able to
conform in youth and how they accepted ""gayified"" behavior in adulthood.
Things don't seem that clear cut to me for several reasons:
The first reason is that I wouldn't know whether to classify myself as
a Q or R. On one hand, much of ""gayified"" behavior and style really
turns me off. Just as the authors say of R's, my reaction OFTEN
is ""Why would someone want to appear that way?"" On the other hand,
I don't shun the gay ghetto and, like Q's, I suspect that a gay man
who does so suffers from internalized homophobia. In my childhood,
I was an unathletic sissy. I could not conform, but unlike the author's
description of Q youths, I did not turn non-conformity into anti-conformity.
Instead I deeply wished I could conform.
The second reason is that I often meet ""gayified"" gay men who DID
conform in their youth. They were athletic, they joined a fraternity,
etc. And now as adults they conform within the gay ghetto. Because of
their conformity to some ""gayified"" style, if I had to classify them
as Q's or R's, I would chose Q's. They OFTEN aren't particularly
effeminate, but rather ""masculine"" clone types, who are on one of the
gay bar's softball teams in the gay softball league, who go out
to gay discos on the weekend (at least prior to the epidemic), and in
general, seem to keep their social life restricted pretty much to the
gay ghetto.
The third reason has to do with gay self-hatred. The authors say that R's
put a premium on straight appearance because they were
able to conform and reap the benefits of conformity during their youth.
The authors explain the R's dislike of gayified behavior as
inability to appreciate why Q's lean towards anti-conformity.
The authors claim that the Q's view this dislike as gay self-hatred,
and that the Q's are merely un-understanding of the R's premium on
conformity. I strongly disagree. There is quite a bit of ""R-like""
behavior that IS motivated by homophobia, although it would be
difficult to ascertain how much of this dislike of various
""gayified"" behavior comes from homophobia.
But on the other hand, a lot of what the authors say rings true.
I think that this is so because what they describe are not two
types of gay PERSONS, but rather two DYNAMICS IN OUR PERSONALITIES.
I see both the ""R"" dynamic and the ""Q"" dynamic at work in my own
personality, in my own style, and in the personalities and styles
of my gay male friends. Furthermore, most gay men I meet show quite
a mixture of these two dynamics. As for the way I ""categorize"" (or not)
myself, I do not think of myself as a gayified gay or as a ""straight""
gay, but as a Rob-Bernardo-gay (or as a just plain Rob-Bernardo). I often
feel very critical of gay men who have moved to San Francisco and
gotten too GHETTOIZED. They seem to have lost their individuality
in conforming to the gay ghetto. But that's another posting to net.motss.
So, what I think the authors missed is that conformity in youth
can lead to conformity to the gay ghetto in adulthood, and that
some dislike for gayified behavior is due to homophobia.","GilhGtHFa8wJ",23,1985-11-23,-11,10

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

Steve on several occasions in the past you have strongly suggested that 
we ignore Ken Arndt, and that any kind of reply only makes him worst.
Well I feel that I expressed myself quite plainly in net.flame and also that
I got through to Ken in recent personal mail ...
as evidence I copy the following from Kens recent posting in net.motss.
along with some comments of my own!
I know that Ken's postings are offensive, juvenile, and sickening. But in all
reality Kens attitudes are typical of lots of people, people who are frightened and threatened by our very existence. Ken is just more persistent and more
insensitive than most. We are gonna have to be able to take on people like Ken 
and we are gonna have to be able to talk directly to this kind of nonsense,
or crawl back into the shadows, mayby forever this time.
Ignoring Ken Arndt is not gonna make him go away, and I personally believe
that Its wrong to try and censor him... (I know that I have expressed a 
different view before, and Ive changed my mind. )

Clearly Ken is still indulging in his inimitable style of what he considers wit.
But I also feel that we have here the first glimmerings of the REAL KEN ARNDT..
How many closet cases have we all seen who are convinced that if they do not remain vigilant in their attacks on ""Those homo's"" then their whole line of defense
will fall apart and they will be swept away by the urges within that keep them
living in a purgatorial pit of guilt and sensuous fantasy. An aquaintance once
told me that his biggest fear about going to Gay bars or Mens groups, was that 
he was convinced he would be jumped by all these letcherous faggots, his pants 
pulled down and his macho honor destroyed forever. The reality was that it 
never happened, and he had to face that in actuality he was disappointed.

Here Ken shows off his mysoginistic tendencys in such a way that no comment is 
necessary.

(Just for grins Ken I think most of us motss'ers would object to being pigeon

stuff).
This is a very Bold and revealing move on Kens part, he is telling us a lot 
with this paragraph, and it comes from very deep levels of his psyche...
He admits to masturbating, now don't take this lightly many more wordly types
cannot make even this small step towards self-understanding. He also tells us
that he found masturbation unfulfilling,in the same paragraph we are told why.

It is a great pity that so many are unaware that its ok to do something nice and
sexual with and for yourself. 
Kens backhanded comment about how he Loves ALL women EQUALLY (and not really
saying how little that is) reveals the anger he feels about having to expend
his love on them instead of being able to keep it for himself.
  >Well, I feel the same way about homosexuality as I do about masturbation.  It
  >falls short of what sex is all about.
Here is a very interesting statement, since Ken has already admitted to being
a masturbator (at least some time in his life)
and is stating here that he feels the same way about homosexuality as 
masturbation
Can we have a pause to wonder if Ken is making this judgement based on personal
experience. After all he is saying ""It falls short of what sex is all about""
this sure sounds like a firm belief based on real life experience to me.
Interestingly enough it is very common for first sexual experinces to be 
absolutly dreadfull for most people. I know that my first Adult encounter with
Gay sex was so traumatic that its a wonder that I ever tried it a second time!

AAHHHHHH now we are getting rightin there to the root of Kens festering painfull
feelings..
First of all ""the Homosexuals"" have forced Ken to spend so much time and 
emotional energy preaching to these filthy buggerers because they ""tout""
an alternative lifestyle and even insist on being given basic human rights 
Ken almost see's daylight when he admits that what he is in opposition to
is merely his VIEW of Gay peoples lack of understanding about ""what sex is all
about"", and and that he THINKS we are are actually anti-sex. (Better watch out
Ken these are weaknesses that I'm sure the I.C. chaplain will find disturbing)
But of course he redeems himself by flatly proclaiming our sexual behaviour as
self-destructive.

Well let me 'splain it to you Ken.... In the first place some people like
mutual masturbation, in fact some people like it to the exclusion of just about anything else.And when the participants al have the same (or at least similar)
equipment there is hardly a limit of two individuals. As to having a problem 
about where to put ""it"" (I will assume that you mean your penis) I don't know

any trouble finding a good place to put ""it"".

NO... Ken ... its not really hate.. its presumptuous....
the WAY you say it is hatefull, and often cruel.
Your analogy is seriously flawed right up front because  you call Gay sex
a pretension to human sexual fulfillment, this is a matter that is necesarily
the domain of the individual. It is not your place to judge whether anyone else
is fulfilled or not, no matter what you may personally think of the behavior
in question. I recognise that there are many individuals who do not find
same sex partnerships to be sexually fulfilling, but your protestations
not withstanding Ken, there are some individuals who do.
And thats a FACT..............

Since you've asked why we protest at what you've said after you call us 
pretentious perverts,flagrant touters of death dealing un-natural sexual
self gratification,comedic perpetrators of self destructive immoral anti-sex,
mutually masturbating merchants of loneliness, and worst, I'll tell you.
Its because you stick your ill-informed bigotted nonsense out where every
body can see how silly it is, and you have been unnecesarilly cruel and 
persistent in your terrorism (there I said it again) of this newsgroup.
You know that you come here to motss in order to stir up shit ;-)
you enjoy the attention, we aren't fooled by your claims of an evangelical
mission to save our worthless and unfulfilled lives. Besides this isn't a
protest over what you say , this is an opportunity to squarely face  the
kind of bigotry and fearfull anger breeding homophobia that every Gay 
person has had to deal with every day of their lives.

Once again proving that Ken is an agent of the international banking conspiracy
exhorting us all to self enslavement by the charge card Barons of the

and stimulating dialogue..
And I hope that all you degenerates out there will be gentle with ole Ken
when he eventually cums around to his senses and turns the other cheek...;-)

Shame, shame, shame on you people for goading Ken in private messages.
Unfortunately, this generally overstimulates him, leading to another message

I would be interested in a proof on how gay sexual behaviour is self-
destructive. I engage in it with my lover, and I have found that it is
constructive; the physical act is only one aspect of it. I guess I don't
believe in sex, only making love. A bonding occurs (or should, in my
opinion) when such an act is performed. I'm afraid that Mr. Ardnt is the
one who seems to lack understanding of what the act is all about.
He also evidences a lack of understanding in what exactly occurs in
homosexual acts.

I'd be interested in a proof demonstrating that it is a perversion. Such 
behaviour occurs elsewhere in nature (it's been observed in marine mammals
and avian species among other). And who is he to say what sexual fulfilment
(or fulfullment, as he says)is anyway? What may be fulfilling for him may not
be for others. I'm afraid Mr. Ardnt lack the quality of empathy.

Again, can he prove his assertion? Anal intercourse is not the only way to
communicate the disease, and it may not be the only factor. The condition
of the immune system at the time the virus is introduced to the body may
be a factor as well.
Mr. Ardnt makes many assertions, but I think the proof for the, if it exists,
is flimsy at best. It is nice to see something written by him which is
halfway decent though. That's nice.","g9t8pGWN0fIJ",2,1985-11-16,11,21

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

Mark, if you had been following the discussion concerning sign language, you 
would know that there are derogatory signs for gays and lesbians.  
This person was only curious if there were similar signs for straight 
people; she/he was not being anti-heterosexual.  Stop being so defensive!
No, calling straight people names is not the most mature response that
gays and lesbians can muster, but you have to keep in mind that many
straight people are oppressive threats to our health and well-being
(some gay and bisexual people are probably threats to our well-being,
as well). Calling straight people ""breeders"" is a harmless, childish
way to vent steam. I don't condone it, but worse evils demand my

Are you referring to effeminacy in gay men?  Are you referring to 
masculine traits in lesbians?  Are you saying that all gays and 
lesbians ""pose""?   How can you be so sure if it is a pose or if it is 
actually the way the person was meant to act?  Or, are you opposed to 
gay men acting different from straight men, lesbians acting different 
from straight women?
There is a school of gay thought that says that gay people *are* 
different.  We are the same as straights in our humanity, but different 
in our expression of that humanity.  Since we break societal mating 
norms, we are free to experiment with the male/female role 
models.  Hence, we have formed a distinct gay/lesbian subculture.  You 
can even make a good argument for a gay male subculture distinct from 
a lesbian subculture.
What's the matter, Mark, do our differences bother you?  If you are 
unable to celebrate differences, then you can concentrate on the many 
things that straight people, and gays and lesbians have in common.

Gee, if you want to treat everyone the same, why shouldn't we stop the 
differentiation between gay ""posers"" and ""masculine"" gay men, between 
""butch"" lesbians and ""feminine"" lesbians.  Why can't we celebrate 
these differences, or will celebrating these differences in gays and 
lesbians cause straight people to question their own male/female role 
models?
Just throwing out a few ideas.  Maybe someone else can take them and 
run with them...

                    the laws - like ERA).  And never to know that one woman

For those of you not fortunate enough to live within his zone of
syndication, Arthur Hoppe is the political satirist in the San
Francisco Chronicle. He is usually on target & quite funny, but
sometimes (esp. lately) his sense of humor flags with his reaction
to the world around him. Unannounced & unpermitted, I forward for 
your examination his column for today (10Sep). I DO hope that only
ONE copy of this shows up at any given site & that it's legible;

""The New Lepers""
It was at a party. I had filled my glass at the bar and turned. Behind
me was a middle-aged man I had known for several years. I don't know
him well. We had talked several times. He is a gentle, soft-spoken
soul and I like him.
A month or so ago, I heard he had AIDS. I thought of calling or writing
him, but what do you say? And now here he was. He held out his hand. For
a fraction of a second, I involuntarily hesitated. Then, of course, I 
shook it.
If he does have AIDS, I can only pray that he didn't notice that flicker
of hesitation. I am deeply ashamed of it. I can think of nothing more
dishonorable than to fail to offer your hand to a dying man.
Only the day before, a dear friend who is a reasonable sort demanded to
know why ""the newspapers didn't print the truth about AIDS"" - primarily
about what a danger AIDS poses to the middle-class heterosexual community.
""I was at dinner the other night and we spent at least an hour talking
about nothing else,"" he said, and there was a hint of fear and anger
in his voice.
I tried to tell him that for the last couple of years newspapers have
gone out of their way to publish stories about AIDS and their message was
precisely the opposite: every recorded case of AIDS has been the result
of the virus being transmitted into the bloodstream either by contaminated
blood or contaminated semen. There is no other known way to contract the
disease.
I don't think he heard me. I don't think people are listening. I think
they are too unreasonably scared.
""The food's good,"" said a woman I know, talking about a restaurant she no
longer frequents because many of the waiters are gay, ""but why take chances?""
""My heart goes out to him,"" a mother was quoted as saying in a news story
about a young pupil who had AIDS, ""but I wouldn't feel right letting my
child be in his classroom.""
In San Francisco, city officials denounced as ""a cruel hoax"" notices
falsely claiming that AIDS patients would be quarantined in remote loca-
tions. Yet at least some gays took it seriously.
And rightly so. From most reports, gays are being increasingly evicted,
fired and ostracized as the disease spreads increasingly among them and
the heterosexual community becomes increasingly frightened.
It's no wonder gays refuse to give their names when taking tests for AIDS.
If I were gay, I wouldn't want my name on any list. There's not much harm
now, but if no cure is found and if the disease and the fear continue their
exponential growth...
I keep thinking about leprosy. We used to ring bells and shout, ""Unclean!""
when we saw a leper coming, or lock them up in deplorable colonies for the
rest of their lives. We knew that their very touch would make us lepers too.
Today, we have learned that leprosy is transmitted only through prolonged,
intimate exposure. We now call it ""Hansen's disease"" and treat its victims
as out-patients. They walk among us posing no more danger than a stranger
with AIDS.
I like to believe that the human race is getting better over the millenia.
Aftr all, that hope is our only chance of survival in a nuclear age. So 
I can only pray that we react more reasonably to an unreasonable fear this
time around.
Thus I'm afraid - not of AIDS, but of our reaction to it. Your reaction and
mine. And if a dying friend of mine reads this, I hope he will forgive me.
I'd like to shake his hand.

within	the  gay  community""  by  Marshall  K.	Kirk and ""Erastes Pill"", in
""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
""Amongst ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank and power  in	the
gay world, and the opposing sides are drawn in terms of	self-identification
and public appearance.	What is	worse, this  struggle  for  hierarchy  will
continue unless	we abandon some	of the dogmas of the gay establishment.	...
""The shared impressions	and arguments put forth	 here  are  tentative,	our
generalizations	 are  riddled  with exceptions,	and we imagine that some of
our speculations will be proved	incorrect.
""First,	consider two modes of self-perception. ...  Many gay  men  like	 to
identify themselves either as 'straight	gays' (R-types)	or not (Q-types).
_ R_ -_ t_ y_ p_ e_ s__ v_ i_ e_ w__ t_ h_ e_ m_ s_ e_ l_ v_ e_ s
""Rs like to think that they pass as straights on  the  street.	They  value
highly their acceptance	in general society, and	many are careful to sustain
friendships in the  straight  community.   Rs  are  proud  of  their  manly
appearance, and	typically rankle over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
gay males.  They may be	receptive  to,	or  even  obsessive  about,  social
conventions   and  norms  based	 on  gender  distinction;  ...	 completely
homosexual Rs may persist in describing	themselves as 'bisexual.'
""The one thread	connecting the childhoods of Rs	we have	interviewed is _ p_ e_ e_ r
_ a_ c_ c_ e_ p_ t_ a_ b_ i_ l_ i_ t_ y.	 By and	large, Rs were kids who, for one reason	or another,
_ c_ o_ u_ l_ d conform with ease, and so	did. ...  Young	Rs,  it	 seems,	 were  only
dimly  aware  of  their	need for the rewards of	acceptability, effortlessly
achieved.  So the arrival of adolescent	sexuality  sent	 a  stunning  shock
through	 well-adjusted	Rs.  ...   Many	 boys  ignored	and  disguised this
discovery until	they could come	to terms with it.  In the meantime, teenage
Rs struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer image.  Even as
they grew up to	enjoy sex with other boys on the  sly,	conformism  in	all
other aspects of demeanor became the self-exacted _ q_ u_ i_ d _ p_ r_ o _ q_ u_ o.
_ Q_ -_ t_ y_ p_ e_ s__ v_ i_ e_ w__ t_ h_ e_ m_ s_ e_ l_ v_ e_ s
""... these gays	often are not, and feel	 that  they  do	 not  wish  to	be,
'straight-acting  and appearing.' The extreme Q	is a homosexual	on display.
(He may	not always be one display ... [e.g.] in	the presence of	family	and
employers.)  On	 the  street,  he  may assume any one of the several public
personas most familiar to the straight world: the pomaded and permed 'fem',
the titanic leather master, the	clipped	clone, the _ G_ Q hyperboy,	and others.
...  Qs	are outwardly _ g_ a_ y_ i_ f_ i_ e_ d;	 they  have  bought  into  strict  outgroup
stereotypes  which,  whether  screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
constitute a burlesque of gender roles.	 Qs think of themselves	as  visible
gays, and tend to make such a profile central to their ego structure. ...
""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,	and  Qs	 are  perhaps  more
likely	than  Rs  to  be  drawn	 toward	 the asylum of gay ghettos in urban
centers. ...
""Whereas Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and so  did,  many	 Qs
felt that, for whatever	reasons, they could not	conform	during their youth,
and so	did  not.   Those  reasons  might  include  passivity,	effeminacy,
homeliness,  remarkable	 prettiness,  lack of athletic skill, or almost	any
other cause for	unpopularity among male	youth.	At first,  evidently,  many
Qs  were unhappy loners	who salvaged their self-esteem by making a lodestar
virtue	out  of	 _ i_ n_ d_ i_ v_ i_ d_ u_ a_ l_ i_ s_ m	rather	than  peer  acceptance.	  But  non-
conformity engenders anti-conformism.  So some Qs went further and acquired
a taste	for outrageousness, actively calculating shock to others  in  order
to reinforce their social status as rebels with	a cause. ...
""As the	years go by, and they learn that  they	are  not  alone,  Qs  adopt
zealously  the	visible	 uniforms and credos of	their supporting outgroups.
...  Surveys have shown	that, for many Qs, camp	behavior is a passing phase
of overt defiance, toned down in later years.
""When those gays who boast R-status meet those who defend  Q-status,  there
can  be	 trouble.   First, let's look at things	for the	viewpoint of the R.
For one	thing, the sexual objects of Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs,  for	the
most  part  are	scorned. ...  It is the	'fem' [from among the variety of Q-
type personas] who bears the brunt of the invective from Rs. ...
""[Gay] bars are	often regarded by Rs as	the bastions of	self-segregated	 Qs
-  branded  as twinkie bars, leather bars, etc.	- and so may be	viewed with
distaste. ...
""We should mention at this point that those Rs who shun	the  bars  find	 it
more  difficult	 to lead satisfactory sex lives.  They have trouble meeting
other Rs because, unlike visible Qs, out in the	straight world most Rs have
banished  any  tell-tale  signals  of  homosexuality  from their conformist
uniforms and are wary of mistaken self-exposures. ...
""To make sexual	matters	still more difficult for many  Rs,  they  face	two
more  unique  dilemmas.	 ...  First, ... a Q may be drawn to, and satisfied
by, a relationship with	an acceptably masculine	R.  But	what of	the classic
R-type	-  the 'all-American boy' whose	only felt shortcoming is his sexual
preference?  For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual object  possessing	the
one  feature he	feels he lacks and wishes to capture - may very	well be	the
straight boy, who is, by definition, unattainable. ...
""The second sexual dilemma faced by Rs	involves  the  ritual  of  sex-play
itself.	  For at least some Rs,	it seems, masculine _ r_ o_ l_ e _ p_ e_ r_ f_ o_ r_ m_ a_ n_ c_ e is	the
most thrilling part of sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened  in	 homosexual
practices such as passive anal sex or active fellatio. ...
""But even if the R is contentedly 'out'	to family and  friends,	 and  self-
exposure is not	an issue, he may still dislike Qs for two related reasons.
""First,	because	the R has typically conformed with ease	to the	mainstream,
the  exaggerated  outgroup displays of Qs simply _ b_ a_ f_ f_ l_ e	him.  Why would	any
person _ c_ h_ o_ o_ s_ e to draw such public ridicule and abuse, he wonders?  ...	 'I
don't  see why they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
[we interviewed].  'It obviously looks phony and fools no  one.'  At  best,
then,  many Rs come to view Qs the way that many straights view	homosexuals
_ e_ n _ b_ l_ o_ c, as somehow foolish and	trivial, a nationality of sterile  cuckoos.
...
""Second, Qs do more than baffle	Rs - they also _ i_ r_ r_ i_ t_ a_ t_ e	Rs terribly,  to  a
degree	that  more  detached  straights	cannot understand.  Many Rs plainly
resent being identified	with the Qs, and blame them for	the  weird  profile
of homosexuals as a whole. ...
""Like most gay males, it seems,	even exotic Qs hear the	siren call  of	the
rutting	R.  And	so relations between Qs	and Rs grow still more tense.
""It is our impression that, for	_ b_ o_ t_ h Rs	and Qs,	archetypal Rs the 'idols of
the  tribe.'  It  is  the  R whose natural masculine grace tops	the overall
hierarchy of desirable traits in the fierce gay	competition of good  looks.
Handsome  Rs  often  sense  this  pecking order, and feeds their egos while
hardening their	disdain	for Qs,	especially the effeminate ones.	...
""Many Qs may learn from	necessity to refocus their libido on fellow Qs.	...
""For it	is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after the  R	 as  sexual
object,	they may also resent and reject	him as social companion!  There	are
several	reasons	for this rejections. 'Sour  grapes'  is	 an  understandable
reaction  from those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
have defensively fashioned a lifestyle out of  peculiar	 individualism	are
bound  to resent (and perhaps envy just	a little) those	gays who can and do
successfully conform to	straight standards.  ...   There  is  more  to	Q/R
estrangement than just these problems.
""For one thing,	if the handsome	all-American straight boy is  the  ultimate
sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-type homosexual must appear as
a ghostly mock-up of the real thing. ...
""Further, Rs are still more upsetting to those Qs who believe that  'butch'
behavior  is  just  an	unnatural  put-on  for gays. ...  Just as the anti-
conformity of Qs baffles  Rs,  the  ease  with	which  Rs  conform  to	the
mainstream   may  be  hard  for	 Qs  to	 understand.  ...   Hence,  Qs	may
misinterpret the Rs' ingrained disinclination  to  gayified  behavior,	and
label it homophobia. ...
""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type persona as	the  'true'
gay type, and hence feel like outsiders	within their own outgroup. ...
""How do	these tensions between Rs and  Qs  affect  the	social	structures,
political  institutions,  and  activist	 success  of the gay community?	...
Those who could	not hide have instead turned to	make  their  stand  against
oppression,  and  Qs  have risen to political leadership and brotherhood in
the activist movement across America.  This is to  their  credit.   Extreme
Qs,  as	 a  group, may rate below Rs on	the sociosexual	hierarchy, but they
can and	do rank	above them on the scale	 of  _ p_ o_ l_ i_ t_ i_ c_ a_ l	power  in  the	gay
world.
""In the	meantime, reticent Rs, who benefit from	the sacrifices	of  Qs	and
yet carp about their flamboyant	image in the straight world, have been able
to have	it both	ways: they achieve  personal  acceptability  in	 the  right
straight  world	 of  today,  while  relishing  the  progress  toward social
flexibility made on their behalf for  tomorrow.	  But  because	Rs  do	not
choose to play the activist game in great numbers, they	lose their ability,
as a group, to influence the rules of that game.
""Although the point is hard to prove with certainty, we	suspect	that it	 is
mainly	Qs  who	organize the gay community, set	its norms, and decide which
of its collective efforts are PC ['politically correct'].   PC	initiatives
are  those  which  the gay leadership and press	deem to	be good	for the	gay
community as a whole.  And the mobilization  of	 the  R-type  subgroup,	 it
turns out, is definitely _ n_ o_ t PC	- at least, not	in Boston.  Let	us give	you
an example.
""Several years ago, a handful of young men in that city	attempted to  start
an  organization  which	 would	bring together self-perceived Rs for social
activities.  They posted two  short  announcements  in	college	 and  local
papers	with  the  headline,  'STRAIGHT	 GAYS.'	 The leaders rather crudely
hinted that this new club would	be  for	 those	young  gays  'not  entirely
comfortable  with  the	glittering bar crowd.' One of the authors attending
the organization's first meeting.  He found the	room  packed  with  excited
and  grateful  Rs,  who	 immediately set about the organization	of the club
activities  ranging   from   baseball	to   opera-listening.	 The   only
qualification for membership was self-selection	according to the understood
character of the organization, and its aims  remained  social  rather  than
political.  ...	  Within  weeks,  the  club  was  regularly  drawing to	its
meetings between one and two hundred members - making it one  of  the  most
active	gay groups in Boston. ...  Its leaders likened the group to the	gay
clubs designed to bring	together men with other	special	interests, such	 as
the  black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite,	or 'man/boy love' societies
in town.
""Boston's gay leadership did not buy the comparison,  however.	 There	was
evident	 suspicion  and	 resentment (based some	part, no doubt,	on envy) at
the prospect of	 'student-aged'	 all-American  Rs  cloistering	exclusively
among  themselves  for	social	and  sexual  companionship.   A	 local	gay
newspaper attacked the group openly for	its supposed macho snobbery and	for
the  'closet  cases'  it seemed	to nurture. ...	 The organization's leaders
protested that their intentions	had  been  misunderstood  (although,  in  a
sense,	they  have  been  all-to-clearly understood - and found	politically
incorrect).  But eventually they bowed to the  pressure.   Over	 two  years
they  gradually	 phased	 out the stress	upon 'straight gays.' The criticism
from the gay community stopped coming.	Alas, so  did  the  group's  R-type
members.   Having  lost	 its distinctive drawing card, the entire operation
fizzled.  It had failed	the test  of  PC  administered	by  the	 Q-oriented
community. ...
""And there is a	final twist in the Q/R cold war	which may impede the growth
of  gay	 rights	 from  time to time.  R-type gays are the ones who actually
succeed	in slipping into the  circles  of  mainstream  political  power	 in
America.   So  it is a sad irony that confidential liaisons between uptight
Rs in government and Qs	heading	the gay	activist movement  can	be  further
strained by the	R's basic alienation form unconventional Qs in general.	...
""This analysis has found the gay world	troubled  and  handicapped  by	the
mutual	alienation  of Qs and Rs.  It is PC to deny this split.	...  First,
we must	abandon	PC myths and admit that	the split exists.  Second, we  must
understand clearly the root cause of the Q/R cold war.	Someone	once called
it  'oppression	 sickness':   each  outgroup  member  is  ill-at-ease  with
himself,  and  is  frustrated  by his forced companions, because the social
mainstream imposes pressures and expectations which he feels that he cannot
meet,  and  because  his  companions remind him	of his own failure.  So	the
more progress we can make toward social	acceptance in  the  straight  world
for gays as a whole, the less tension we will see between groups _ w_ i_ t_ h_ i_ n	the
gay world. ...
""In the	meantime, the gay community should recognize the distinct  identity
and  special  problems of R-type homosexuals - and could begin by expanding
the aegis of PC	tolerance to include R-type organizations.
""At the	same time, the community must also burn	off the	chaff  of  its	own
implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""

     The current Christopher Street has an article addressing
America's increasing conservatism (I, for one, think the media is
unwittingly increasing conservatism by focusing on ""yuppies"" and
""increasing conservatism"", but you can insert your own theory on the
cliche at this point and read on).  The main thrust seems twofold:
diminish the emotional reaction accompanying words like ""gay"" and
""homosexual"", and re-interpret the gay cause as one for universal
American principles: freedom to beleive what you want, to say what you
want, to do what you want as long as it doesn't conflict with other's
rights (needless to say, that doesn't include the right to not deal
with gay issues).  Straights might not defend your right to have
children, but they'll defend to their deaths the right for you to talk
about it-- at least in theory.  (For the record, children of
homosexuals are probabilistically Less likely to turn out homosexual--
too bad stats don't have much impact on the way people make
decisions).
     I, for one, am very glad to see a conservative movement within
the gay subculture.  Ok, partly I'm biased because I beleive in
economic conservativism (generally laissez faire), but partly it's
because I'm tired of Sister Boomboom representing the gay cause to
America's families.  
     PCness (Political Correctness) has rendered the gay movement
impotent.  By calling Robert's Rules of Order heterosexual societal
baggage, it has created meetings decaying to complete disorder.  About
six years ago, a congressional report asked for suggested revisions to
American sex education to incorporate the lessons of the gay cause.
No response from the gay community was ever given, partly because
side issues had equal priority: cross-dressing is ok, isn't it?  Sex
between people widely divergent in age is ok, isn't it?  
     Before you (perhaps otherwise justly) accuse me of the same
intolerant attitudes towards diversity that Jerry Falwell and the KKK
have, let me say that I beleive goodness is in the eyes of the
beholder, and that only acts which are clearly destructive should be
prohibited.  But at the same time let me claim that the reason I
realize this is because I am forever rubbing up against the walls
society has arbitrarily placed against what I want to do.  And let me
further claim that, having grown up in a small midwestern town, had I
not rubbed up against those restrictions I would (perhaps) be as
intolerant as the rest.
     For although I recognize it is wrong to restrict others' freedom
in the name of making my own world more ""perfect"" (taken to extreme,
the mentality shouts ""less Catholics, Jews, Blacks, homosexuals to
estrange my children-- everyone should be just like me""), I also claim
that the gains to be made in the 1980's do not stem from convincing
others that this is true.  The media resents broadcasting messages
like this during the Reagon admistration (what kind of a message would
that be during a conservative ""era""?).  
     The Gay cause must set specific goals, achievable one at a time,
which satisfy two conditions: a) the goal must be acheivable in the
current political climate, and b) the goal must be supported by a
large number of individuals willin to contribute to the cause.  Yes,
this might mean we must temporarily halt our struggle against
pornography censors in order to get the feminist cause back on our
side.  It might mean we must abandon our struggle to lower the age of
consent in some states in order to get wider support for the abolition
of sodomy laws.  But it might also mean step by step victories which
will form the basis of a further movement towards maximum freedom.  
     In the end, we must stop estranging the most wealthy gays in the
country who, up till now, have been reticent to donate money to a
cause plagued with the reputation of being slightly left of cummunism.
It is time to free ourselves of our extremest stereotyping, to let
people know who we, as gays and lesbians, truly are-- rather like
everyone else.

on-going  discussion  in  net.motss,  and in a follow-up, I agreed and
said I would post an article about personal issues in my life as a gay
man.  This is it.
After thinking,	I came up with three major personal issues  that  have
to do with my being a gay man on a daily basis.
   - feeling disenfranchised
   - AIDS
   - forming a home with someone
I feel incredibly vulnerable about what	I wrote	below,	but  what  the
hell.	I  feel	 most vulnerable in front of those people at work that
will read this but who I do not	know well  enough  to  talk  about  my
feelings with.
DISENFRANCHISEMENT
I  feel	 disenfranchised   as	a   result   of	  heterosexism.	   (By
'heterosexism'	I  mean	 an  unwitting	or  unconscious	 assumption on
someone's part that everyone  is  heterosexual	and  perhaps  leads  a
certain	type of	life, e.g.  marriage, family.)
The disenfranchisement	I  feel	 does  not  come  from	individuals  I
personally  deal  with,	 but  more  from  people at a distance or from
institutions.  For example, the	people at work who  I  talk  with  are
basically  not	heterosexist.	But the	words and actions of coworkers
who I do not interact with much, even professionally,  sometimes  make
me  feel  disenfranchised.   Just subtle things	in the way they	phrase
things sometimes.  Usually nothing so consciously anti-gay that, if  I
chose, I could challenge them about.
Nobody but me in our office openly gay that I  know  of.   No  one  to
REALLY	talk 'sisterly'	with.  There are a couple three	people at work
I can sort-of talk with	to in the way I	 would	only  normally	do  to
another	gay man, e.g. feeling comfortable enough to remark how nice it
is that	there are quite	a few construction workers around to  look  at
(the  building	is  half  unbuilt).   And  that	comfort	came only very
recently.
Sometimes I feel lonely.
AIDS
I don't	think there has	been a single day in the past year or so  that
I  have	 not thought about, worried about the threat of	AIDS.  The New
York Native (a NY-based	gay biweekly newspaper that is national	in its
scope of news) arrived today and a good	quarter	of its 60 odd pages is
about AIDS.
I will go to the gym tomorrow morning.	I will see  perhaps  a	little
bruise there or	a red mark here	and the	first thing that flashes in my
mind is	KS, even when I	KNOW that I ALWAYS get a little	 bruise	 there
from horseback riding, and that	I ALWAYS have had that little red mark
here ever since	I can remember.	 I will	effortlessly use the  exercise
cycle  for 20 minutes, but later in the	day when I return to my	office
from lunch and get a little winded going up three  flights  of	stairs
while  talking	at  the	same time, I wonder if it is pneumocystis.  On
Friday,	Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, will	come  out.   I
will  turn to the obituary column with morbid interest.	 There will be
half a dozen photos, mostly of gay men about my	age, some  of  whom  I
will recognize from the	neighborhood, from the gym, etc.  Infrequently
there will be someone I	knew  well,  a	person	I  once	 dated,	 or  a
roommate I once	shared an apartment with.
Do you think there's a chance Reagan will get AIDS from	the  blood  (I
presume) he got	during his polyp surgery?
Sometimes I feel terror.
HOME
I dream	of having a home life with another man on a gentleman's	 farm.
Something  small  but pretty.  A few animals - two horses, some	goats.
Something I think I could afford  with	another	 person	 of  the  same
means.
Another	gay man	who likes country living?  Another gay man  who	 likes
horses	(and  that's  not  just	 from  the  other  side	of the fence)?
Another	gay man	whose boots are	not just a part	of his	""cowboy	 drag""
when  he  goes out to the c/w bar on the weekend?  (And, god, he's got
to be intelligent, verbal, and introspective enough to get along  with
someone	 who  grew up in an upper middle class mainly Jewish suburb of
New York, who went to college for 10 years,  and  who  is  a  computer
programmer).
Sometimes I laugh!

I think this is a very common feeling among gay people, though how one
reacts to it depends on where it happens, how much you have learned to
artificially separate your personal life from your public persona, and how
sensitive you are to the kind of dissonance this produces.
It hasn't been a real problem for me where I work, except in one particular
instance which won't happen again: every year BBN holds a ""winter party"" at
a local museum with food, music and dancing, and last winter, the entire
company was invited.  Plans for my lover and I to meet up with other gay
and non-gay friends quickly vanished as I tried to find them among the
2000-odd people meandering around the six sprawling floors of the Science
Museum.  Lots of strangers, lots of people you wouldn't even want to talk
with even IF your lover weren't standing next to you, straight couples
EVERYWHERE, and my local support system nowhere to be found.  Aauuugggh.
After a few hours we left, suffocating from the thick cloud of
heterosexuality.  (I am sure I have just ""disenfranchised"" the straight
contingent here, but I'm telling it to you ""straight"", as it were.)

would be interested in the view point of a ""straight"" married female.  You
might be interested to know that we share some of the same views.  I have 
also been unhappy about the volume of postings to this net group.  What is
there tends to be of good content, but what struck me the most is I always
see the same names.  I am posting this via anonymous electronic mail for
two reasons.  I am new to the net and have just not learned how to post, and as
I am only working for the summer, it was not worth taking the time.  Also,
to be honest, I would hesitate to post to this news group because I would
not want anybody getting the wrong idea about me, even if I am married.  Of
course if anybody did, that would mean they also read this news group, right?
It will not be possible for me to receive any mail, as I am getting ready to
leave, but I probably still be reading the news group, so any public responses
(good or bad) are welcome.
	I am sure you wonder why I would be interested in your news group.
Some of you may think it is only a sordid curiosity.  I like to understand
what is happening around me.  The foreign friends I have had fascinate me
when they talk about their culture and beliefs.  In the same way your
culture fascinates me.  You live a life and emotions I do not understand, 
only because you are in a situation unlike any I have ever known.  The only 
close gay friends I have had were in high school, and still in the transition 
period where they had serious questions within themselves, so yours is a world 
completely unfamiliar to me.
	As for Ken Arndt, I know he attacks a very sensitive area with you,
but I really think it should not bother you.  In reading other news groups,
he is just as unpopular.  More than any other, he is openly insulted for his
view points.  Coming from anybody else, I can understand the agony it would
cause, but Ken is a sub-human life form with a pretense of human emotions.  I
was honestly surprised when he said he still loves you, and when are you going
to get together.  I would have been even more surprised if you had taken him
up on it, and would have assumed it was only to greet him in hostile numbers
with ulterior motives, but then that would be sinking to his level.
	One thing I would like to say, just as you might not like being
characterized as having a certain behaviour because you are gay, I too feel
slightly offended by the category you lump us in at times.  Remember, the
most hostile are probably also the most verbal.  Do you always have the best
of your group represent you?  On our campus the ""leader of the gays"" (self-
proclaimed, of course) was the local joke, and though I don't know this for
a fact, I suspect he only made things harder for some of the others.  It seemed
that every time he did not get what he wanted it was because he was discriminated
against for being gay.  This was believable the first time, but the fourth or
fifth time, the story got old.  Now, if I believed he truly represented all
gays on our campus, I would have come up with a pretty low opinion of them.
Instead, I chose to judge people on an individual basis.
	On the Jason on Bars article - I found it amusing.  It seemed to me
to be a cross between honesty and friendly humour.  It did not seem like the
article of a depressed resentful person taking his problems out on others.
I also learned something from it, as I have learned from all of the articles,
but I didn't take it as a verbatim narrative of a typical night at the bars.
It seemed the point was the emotions creating the actions, not a satire of
the gay whores.  The articles on the gay emotions have been much more interesting
than the rehashed stories on AIDS.  This is the only place I know that I can
find such honesty about the feelings and struggles of gay people.  Of course,
it would mean more if more people contributed.  I strongly encourage others
to take advantage of the anonymous postings.  It would also help if any body
who did chose some nick name, so multiple postings can be easily followed.
	Well, I know I have rambled on.  I hope this was taken in the positive
way it was intended.  If I have inadvertantly offended anybody, I apologize.
I am not aware of everything that is acceptable, ie - I didn't know 
homosexual was a derogatory term until reading this group, I always thought
the term gay was more insulting.

which got me thinking a bit about my everyday life, gay culture,
""gay emotions"", etc.  In a sense this is directed at the non-gay
readers of net.motss, though it's also an invitation for comments
from other gay people.
The issue of differences between gay and straight people is complicated and
multi-faceted, depending on the points you want to make and the method of
analysis you take.  I'm going to concentrate on what will seem almost
blatantly obvious and not worth mentioning to some, but subtlety often gets
lost in this discussion, so I'll forge ahead.  My thesis is, simply, that
there is no such thing as a ""gay emotion"" and that there are few
categorical emotional differences between straight or gay relationships.
This is no less true for committed couples, either cohabiting or married, a
form of relationship which is probably less affected by gay/straight
""cultural differences"" for the points I wish to make.  Right now I know a
*lot* of couples--my straight friends are all at that late 20's-early 30's
""marrying age"", and being in a long-term relationship myself, we've also
gained a lot of gay couples as friends.  I see the same joys, trials and
committment regardless of their sexual orientation.  You still have to take
out the garbage, still have to build a compatible living arrangement, still
can reflect on your partner sleeping next to you, still have to plan
together the life you both wish to live.  The emotions which bind a couple
together and which grow over time are identical in straight or gay
relationships.
I am not trying to dismiss the differences between straight and gay
relationships (which certainly are there: should make some interesting
followup discussion--hint, hint).  I *am* trying to emphasize the
commonality which comes, simply, from our shared humanity.

AIDS so they don't lock us all up, up jumps DELTA VIRUS!  150 cases in

next?  What a run of hard luck.  All these diseases from playing with each
other's shit in the name of love and orientation.  Is Evolution sending
gays a message??  But I digress.  
Remember I just got through saying (again) you guys and gals are disease
vectors because of your behavior and that includes more than AIDS?  Well,
standby for another ram!  And I suspect there are more to come behind that.
I suspect that 'safe sex' may turn out to be monogamous heterosexual!!  I mean
how much satisfaction can you continue to get from what's left after you
attempt to protect yourself from all these pathogens?
Who do you want to bet on, Phil Donohue or Jerry Falwell??  Soon the government
state, local, and Fed will be passing laws against you all - the only thing
up for definition is what the laws will say.  And though Jerry doesn't like
your behavior, gosh, even says its 'wrong' (bigot) he won't (me either friends)
keep silent if it goes too far.
It's time pals for a revaluation of the Agenda, philosophy and behaviors of
the Gay community based upon reality.  Not on what you thought was going to
happen in the '70s.  All you did was increase your exposure to both disease
and the wrath of the public.  Just like some of you feel I have nothing to
say because I don't agree with your views about yourselves YOU, it seems to
me, should realize that the vast majority of the public doesn't buy YOUR
views about sex, family life and how much change should occur.  I see very
little self-criticism in the homosexual community or ideas about how to make
things better other than calling for the straight community to move over and
foot the bill for your problems (claiming that now that it's EVERYBODY'S
problem since AIDS is out of the homosexual community - lovely - although
still overwhelmingly it remains a homosexual problem, we should forget that
the origional and continuing major vector is the homosexual lifestyle) and
live and let live.  AND YOU CONTINUE TO LAUGH AND SMASH AT THE BELIEFS OF
THE MAJORITY AND INSIST THAT THEY MUST GIVE THEM UP!!  Realize that they will
not and come up with a fall-back position.  Or else kill them all, eh?  And
hope they don't think of it first.
You people are some sick puppies, in more ways than one.  What a shame, so
manny of you are such interesting people with so much to contribute.  I think
you've been blinded by the Agenda!  I view you as people with an incorrect
idea about human sexuality that as long as you don't get carried away, demandingequal billing in the society or become a physical melt-down with all your

Ken, you should go to the Dr. and have your blood pressure and sugar
levels checked.  If that all checks out ok, have them do an EEG to
make certain there isn't a tumor.
All, please forgive my giving in to this.  I normally practice what I
preach: ""Treat the cause, not the symptom""; however, Mr. Arndt is a
very serious set of symptoms, and I fear for his health.  It is known
that such stress can lead to lessened disease resistance, and
ultimately defects in the Immune system...

""Saturday Night at the Baths"">> no not a porno but the story of a (supposedly)
straight couple. The woman was a singer or piano player at the Continental
Baths in New York. The movie builds up to the point where her boyfriend ends
up going to bed with one of their gay friends who works at ther baths and
where their relationship goes from there. Has anyone seen these two movies
and how did you feel about them....where can I get them if you know?

    An old friend and I sometimes reminisce about how things were way back
when we first came out in the very early 70's. Some of you who read this
newsgroup may have just recently come out and not remember the good/bad
old days. I have enjoyed the war stories that older gay men have shared
with me of their experiences in the ""Pre-Stonewall"" era; of having to hide,
being involved in bar raids by the vice squad, not having any role models
etc. They also felt that things were better in some ways; because they
shared a common oppression, the men they knew felt a tighter commradeship
than I see today. 
    When I first came out there were no gay newspapers in the Boston area
and I wasn't aware of the existance of ""Bob Damron's Guide"" On campus we
got free copies of ""Boston After Dark"" which later became the ""Phoenix""
Very hesitantly I answered a personal ad from a man who also attended the
same college as I. Larry introduced me to gay life; he was also the first
man I slept with. Larry took me to my first gay bar ""the Other Side"" in
Boston which closed years ago. It was a sleazy place where there was often
trouble with fag bashers and the police. I have to admit to being quite
excited on entering the bar, I was finally home; among others like me.
All the people Larry introduced me to ralleyed around me like old friends;
I was a new member in the fraternity and treated with love and respect.
    Very quickly Boston became my home away from home as I learned where
all the other gay men hung out; Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, The Combat
Zone, to name a few. This was long before the South End enjoyed the gen-
trification that gay pioneers started. There was the Charles Street Meet-
inghouse, a gay coffee house which was Boston's alternative to the bars.
    The bars were much more fun then, friendlier, full of life. Styx,
the 1270 and Cabaret After Dark became my playground. The one thing that
I recall was the lack of ""Attidude"" that prevails in the bars today. We
had to stick together in an atmosphere of opression. The first gay pride
parade I attended was festive, there wasn't the spectre of AIDS to deal
with. It was a day to be seen and celebrate our unity; we still do cel-
ebrate our strength but the parades seem somewhat angrier in recent years.
    There were other firsts I got to see; the first gay magazine that you
didn't have to buy in the Combat Zone, a black and white slick magazine
called ""Mandate"". It could be purchased in a few mainstream Boston book
shops and corner stores. In a lot of ways I liked the first Mandate much
more than what's out now. It had class, attractive models and lacked the
explicitness that Mandate and it's followers show in their centerfolds
today. 
    Back in my early years of coming out the worst worry I had was of may-
be getting rolled by a fag basher while leaving a bar. We would come and go
as a group; safety in numbers! Like a lot of other men back then, I had 
never heard of ""Safe Sex"" and induldged freely whenever I could. I was a 
real slut in my 20's and proud of it. Back then a shot of penicillin could
cure what ailed a guy. We're now faced with a lethal disease that has taken
away friends, family and lovers. Why didn't AIDS start claiming lives 20-
30-40 years ago? Was it a product of our liberation? I can't answer that
but it has certainly effected the way that we interact.
    There's another negative product I see which is an underlying attitude
of ""I don't need you"" As we've become more tolerated/accepted by mainstream
society there seems to be more of an aloofness toward each other; mostly in
bars and gay neighborhoods. Guys went out of their way to introduce them-
selves and be friendly way back then; at least to me. I was no beauty prize
winner then so it wasn't because I was some hot little chicken; matter of
fact friends see old pictures of me and say that I'm much more attractive now.
    So what's the bottom line to all my ramblings? I just feel that it was
more fun to be gay in the late 60's and early 70's. Have we in some ways
become a little jaded over time after fighting a long hard battle to gain
acceptance? I still try to approach new gay social situations with all the
enthusiasm I showed back in ""71"" but get met with apathy, attitude, etc.
So how much headway have we made; AIDS is here for a while, a conservative
political environment is taking some of our rights away; the child custoday
case that's in the news comes to mind, etc. So! we are still operating in
a stiffling world, we still need each other as much as in the Stonewall
era. Go out and shake a new hand, give someone new a big hug!

I'll have to try to find it.
Recently, I finished reading Edmund White's ""Forgetting Elena,"" 
which is much more like ""Nocturnes for the King of Naples"" than

I also read (pseudonym) James Barr's ""Quatrefoil,"" which I found

Now I'm looking for more fun reading.
Also, a friend of mine is going to France this summer and has

	Edmund White has written A BOY'S LIFE (1982?), which got a rave
review by Eliot Fremont-Smith in the NYTimes.  It's a thinly-disguised
autobiography of a gay adolescence, & is I think his best book: he drops
the pretence of trying to be the American Proust.  He also co-authored
THE JOY OF SEX, which for a sex handbook has some great writing.
	The only recent French gay novel I've read is Yves Navarre's
LES LOUKUMS (1972, published in US as SWEET TOOTH by RiverRun Press I
think), an acid satire of New York City using a metaphor of necrophilia;
however, it may make readers wince in these days of AIDS.  Navarre is
openly gay; try his many other novels.  Only a few have been translated
into English, as far as I know.

dancing at night, and I thought I'd report on the day for those not
fortunate enough to be here.
The day started out on a rather crushing note as my lover and I tried
to get downtown on the Muni metro system.  We finally managed to get
into the third train that went by; they were all jammed to the hilt
with people going to the parade.  We managed to get a good position,
right before traffic light for a cross street where they were letting
buses go through, so most of the groups had to stop and wait a bit.
The parade started off, as always, with Dykes on Bikes.  The group
must be growing, as I've never seen so many of them before.  They just
went on and on.  Various political figures followed (Lady DiFi, of
course, was not among them), followed by the contingents for the
various AIDS groups.  They got the biggest applause of the day, and I
wasn't alone in being a bit teary-eyed at that point.
I won't try to be inclusive, but these are some of the more memorable
moments:
Sistah Boom, a feminist political/samba group, really had the crowd
jumping.  I wanted one of the t-shirts several of them were wearing,
""Samba not bomba"".
Both the Gay Fathers and the Lesbian Mothers groups were quite popular
with the watchers.  The parents OF gays and lesbians group was also
warmly received.
Ducks on Trucks were an amusing counterpoint to some of the more
serious groups with their inflatable ducks and feather-covered truck.
The Gay Men's Chorus were all dressed in cute rainbow sailor caps and
had a ""carry"" (like a float, but the pieces were carried by the
marchers) of a ship.  They stopped and gave a rousing rendition of ""We
Sail the Ocean Blue"" from HMS Pinafore.
Several of the South-of-Market bars had floats liberally decorated with
scantily clad mouth-watering hunks.  (down, boy!)
The ALGA group (Association of Lesbian & Gay Asians) had the best drag;
most men look terrible in drag but several of them were even beautiful.
There were many men in various degrees of drag; the most spectacular
was in a costume that would have been at home in any show in Las Vegas.
It had a peacock feather headdress that reached several feet in the
air, and he was positively dripping with rhinestones.  Another guy was
dressed as a witch doctor, complete with horns, feathers, loin-cloth,
and an antlered wand.  Even the Foxy Lady women's wear shop in the
Mission had a float (apparently THE place to go to buy outrageous
clothes).
The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were quite festive in their
rainbow-colored habits.  And the Ladies Against Women had a sizeable
contingent, with their wonderful slogans:  ""I'd rather be ironing,""
""Protect the rights of the unconceived:  sperm are people too,""  ""Roses
not raises,"" and ""Suffering not sufferage.""
I became all choked up at a car bearing just a pillow with a tiara; it
was in memory of Fat Fairy by her friends in Oakland.
The watchers were almost as much fun to watch as the parade.  A pair of
men near us made quite a splash with their rainbow-striped hair.  At
one point a Chinese tourist came up and asked if this was the 4th of
July parade; she didn't seem to speak enough English to understand us
when we tried to explain what was going on.  One woman was watching the
parade bare-chested from atop a bus stop shelter.
As the parade ended, the crowd poured into the street to follow it to
the rally in Civic Center.  The speakers claimed that there were 300,000
people there.  Even given their usual penchant for exagerating, it was
quite exhilirating knowing that you were surrounded by hundreds of
thousands of gay people and their friends.  There was the inevitable
group of bible-thumpers alongside the parade route with their signs
foretelling doom to us all but, other than that, nothing but goodwill
from everyone.
(It was interesting conjecturing about the average straight San
Franciscan's response to the parade; probably something about those
damn faggots blocking off traffic all day.  But I digress.)
After going home to rest up for a while, we went to the party at the
Galleria to dance.  Either people are getting tired of these events or
we picked the wrong party:  there were only about 300-400 people there,
I'd guess.  The Weather Girls performed but the music was, on the
whole, not so great.  We enjoyed ourselves anyway and it was nice
having more than 3 square inches to dance in.
The rest of the day is none of your business.

 As I and those around me were admiring (for want of a better word) this

You remember them, the lobby group that is credited with much of what happened
last election.  At least according to 60 minutes and Norman Lear and other
hysterical liberal types.  The people really didn't vote against the liberals,
they just didn't understand what they were doing - after all how COULD anyone
in their right mind vote against the liberal agenda - and that was because
'radical right wing groups' like Christian Voice fogged the issues.
Of course it's about AIDS.  As you read the quotes below please keep in mind
what I said about Jerry.  These folks are not adverse to puttin' you away!!
""A San Francisco newspaper - Thursday, October 18, 1984 - report said that 53%
of homosexuals are carriers of the virus that causes AIDS -- according to the
homosexuals' own figures that means there are over 10 million AIDS carriers!""
""We can't sit back and hope and pray for some public action to be taken.  We
have got to be safe in hospitals, restaurants, and public places.  Researchers
beleive AIDS can even be spread by saliva and perhaps just by  constant
exposure.""
""Our children deserve a school free from this dreaded communicable disease.""
""We are not trying to hurt homosexuals or lock them away from the rest of the
public . . . but we are serious about protecting ourselves from the ravages of
diseases started and passed on by homosexuals.""
""This is not un-Christian but responsible.  And we intend fro our government
to take this responsibility to the public.""
""But first we must rally massive public pressure.  Our government has acknowledged the threat of this plague by spending $100,000,000 on research for a cure --
coming up with little or nothing.  Why then won't the government spend 10 cents
to tell us how to protect ourselves.  IF WE CAN'T ISOLATE THE DISEASE, WE MUST
ISOLATE THE DISEASE SPREADERS. (italics theirs)""
**************
Now you can see the not quite accurate statements made above.  You know, the
way anti-Christian speakers (some homosexuals included, right?) address the
beliefs and actions of Christians.
The point I'm making is that people ARE starting to take action and get upset
and is that the smell of panic in the air??  Remember this little letter I
received goes to MILLIONS of American homes!!!!  These people have a network
like you wouldn't believe!  And in light of the way the dems are dumpin' the
homosexuals and other 'non-traditional' groups and movin' to the right (even
ole Tubby Teddy for cryin' out loud!) it doesn't look like a fun time ahead.
A few more years of exponential growth of AIDS and hey presto, ""SOMEBODY DO
SOMETHING BEFORE MY KIDS GET SICK!!!""  I'd like to hear some ideas from you
guys besides, ""I'm not spreadin' AIDS."", etc.  I'm not at all sure WHAT you
can do.  But ONE thing you can do is exercise some common sense in attending
those wonderful 'GAY Pride' marches - dump the geeks that are such an affront
to the public taste and those who actually ATTACK the moral values of the
majority (Sister Boom Boom, etc.).  I mean, it doesn't take much thought to
see making fun of someone's cherished beliefs makes for bad feelings.  And I
think you guys and gals will need all the friends you can muster over the next
few years.  My point about Jerry!  Don't be fooled by the circle of friends 
and workers, etc who are all 'feel good' and 'modern' about homosexuality.
I can see them turning on you if the rubber meets the road.  Yuppies are NOT
the wave of the future!  One of these days the banks will call in their debt
and they'll be Yuppies no longer.  (They, as a group, have one of the highest
debt rates.)
People are going to stop patronizing restaurants with 'gay' waiters, etc.
Will there be posters in Rest Rooms diagraming how to exit the stalls using
only your elbows??
Yea, yea the kids poll in favor of leaving the homosexuals alone.  But will
it be the same when they grow up??  Where are the radicals of the '60's now?
Isn't Jerry Rubin working on Wall Street?  Is there really a change in the
weather vis a vis morals?  Are people getting fed up with the 'anything goes'
stuff?  Religion is MORE popular with he folks today than it was in the decades
past!  It's GROWING!!!  And it's no secret what organized religion thinks about
homosexuality.  And don't believe that merde about politics and religion don't
mix.  We ALL know better!  Just ask William Sloan Coffin.
I sent them $20.

& street fair on Christopher Street took place under hot (80s) sunny
skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters
out there willing to post a detailed article?

International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.
""More and More Love"", Japan, 1984, is directly concerned with
homophobia and the AIDS crisis. It tells of a popular singer
who finds love, a journalist who exposes him, the hysterical
reactions of his Christian parents, his fear that he has caught
AIDS and his supportive gay friends. The film is a strong indictment
of the negative effect Christianity has had on Japanese society.
There were a number of long sex scenes (as close to hard-core
as you can get without showing genitals), and this might seem
inappropriate in a serious film to Western audiences.
At the end, there was mixed applause and boos from the audience.
I don't think the boos were deserved, but I agree the film had
some problems, including a rather exaggerated (and perhaps
unfamiliar) style. Directed by Koshi Shimada, and produced by
Japan's (supposedly) most visible gay activist Ken Togoh.
""Naughty Boys"", Netherlands, 1983. After the party, six men
in evening dress, having strange telephone conversations
with remote lovers (in different languages), and remembering
earlier dances. A very experimental and slow-moving film.
We left about half-way through.
""The L-Shaped Room"", UK, 1962. This was in the ""1960's Britsh
Cinema"" series, when British films were beginning to treat
homosexual characters in a non-stereotypical manner.
(Watching the trailers for some of these was pretty amusing.)
Jane (Leslie Caron), pregnant and single, moves into a
seady rooming house. She falls in love with Toby (Tom Bell),
but their love is complicated by the baby and by Toby's poverty.
Among the other boarders are Johnny (Brock Peters - black so of
course he plays the trumpet), who is in love with Toby, and
various other off-beat characters.
Best scene (paraphrased from memory):
@begin(MINOR SPOILER)
Another roomer (Cicily Courtneidge) is an aging ex-vaudevillian.
She reminisces about her one true love.
Jane asks a question about ""him"".
""Him? Who do you mean?""
""Why, your old flame.""
""If you want to, there's a picture of my sweetheart.""
As Jane looks at the picture (another actress), and does double-take:
""It takes all kinds, dear.""
<<Applause>>
Then: ""I hope [the baby] is a girl, dear. Boys are so much trouble.""
<<Applause>>
@end(MINOR SPOILER)
Maltin gives this 3.5 stars, Scheurer (?) 4 stars. I think 3 stars.
It's long, and (while perhaps brave for the time) a little dated.
It's an interesting look at the period, though, and the characters
are also interesting and well acted.
""Horror Vacui-Die Angst vor der Leere"" (Horror Vacui-The Fear of
Emptyness), West Germany, 1984. This tells how a young gay student
falls into the clutches of Madame C and her cult of Optimal
Optimism, and how his more level-headed lover tries to rescue him.
This is filmed in a very minimalist and expressionistic style.
It concerns how people are willing to bow down to an authority
figure who tells them what to do, even at the cost of their own
destruction, and has a post-Nazi sensitivity.
This is a serious, funny and brilliant movie (""worth 5 bucks and
standing in the rain""), directed by Rosa von Praunheim.
""Luminous Procuress"", US, 1971. This film by Steven Arnold was
supposedly a major avant-garde success, and got raves even by
mainstream critics. It tells how two young men are shown around
in a very strange brothel. It's a mostly-straight film. It
features the Cockettes, a comedy/drag/musical troupe from then.
Most of the film displays elaborate but rather static set-pieces,
where nude or outrageously dressed people are part of the scenery.
As a futher alienating device, it's all non-verbal: When people
are speaking, you hear a voice-over of someone speaking what
could be Russian or a nonsense language.
There was applause at the end, but I found it mostly boring.
Shorts:
""David Roche Talks to you about Love"".
Basically a very funny, very cynical and very painful long
monolog by Roche. Definitely worth going out of your way for,
even if you're straight. Quotes:
""Love is knowledge and acceptance (in spite of the knowledge)"".
""A loves B, who loves C, who loves D, who has a vibrator.""
""The Steps"", an amusing little hommage to Sergei Eisenstein.
""Castro Street"", filmed at Halloween. I found it pretty boring,
though many in the audience seemed to like it. Being done in
8mm (at least it looked like it) didn't help. I guess I'm pretty
jaded, having been to too many masquerades at too many science
fiction conventions to be easily impressed.
Earlier I've seen two earlier festival films: ""The Times of
Harvey Milk"" (of which enough has already been said in this
newsgroup), and ""Before Stonewall - The Making of a Lesbian
and Gay Community"" (US, 1984). This is a reasonably good
historical overview upto the Stonewall riots. I heard there
are a couple of historical inaccuracies (there \was/ an
American homophile political group before the Mattachine
Society), and sanitizations.
A number of other movies looked interesting, but it's
a long drive to Mecca...

ask here. As of the last version of this discussion (I'm removing the semiotics
ravings that followed them main questions. Hope that's alright), uninformed
minds want to know....
You can contract AIDS (HLTV-III *isn't* the same thing...I know. What is the
current view of it's relationship to AIDS) by a) sexual contact with *someone
who's got it, and got it from a sexual episode contact with a partner of either sex  who got it from a sexual contact of their own, or one of the things
listed below) b)a blood tranfusion-you are notably at risk if you are the 
sort of hemophiliac who requires unfiltered (uncentrifuged?) blood to preserve
some kind of clotting factor c)an intravenous drug user who shares needles with
one of the people listed above (or another ""c"". Yow! this is recursive)
d)some other form of contact that allows for serum-vectoring of the infective
agent (an immunologist at the last party....).
The little clause in a) suggests some bias, I know. I'll rephrase James'
soapboxing here: That a singly-bonded relationship that is mutually faithful
-whatever the affectational orientation- is not at risk.
Now. What else did the CDC people come up with? Is the above right? Can we
convince Marty to go back to donating blood to the Red Cross instead of
worrying he'll get AIDS?

_A_Disturbed_Peace_
_Another Egypt_
by Brian McNaught
	These can be dark and dreary times for many gay men and
lesbians.
	For some of the people in our developing community, the events
of these days even prompt moments of despair; of angry denunciations of
being gay; of periodic longings for the security of the life they
""remember"" having before coming out of the closet.
	The reasons for these feelings of anxiety are numerous and
certainly understandable.  Some of us, for instance, live in cities in
which 60% of the beds in our hospitals' intensive care units are occupied
by persons with AIDS.  We've lost good friends.  We live in fear of
losing others and of contacting AIDS ourselves.  We're confused and
alarmed.
	Some of us live in states where moronic legislators speak
carelessly of quarantining us in the public interest.  Our local
authorities seek to close our bathhouses and, though we are not patrons
of the baths, we wonder where they will stop.  We're frightened and angry.
	Some of us make our homes in places where our neighbors and our
associates voted overwhelmingly to rescind our rights to employment.
Some of us go to schools where straight students have sold hundreds of
""Fagbuster"" sweatshirts.  Some of us live in towns where anti-gay
violence is dramatically on the rise.  We're shocked and we're depressed.
	""Why did we ever leave the closet?"" some of us ask.  ""What did
we accomplish by coming out?  At least we were safe when we pretended
to be straight,"" some of us argue.  ""Even if it wasn't a perfect life,
it was better to be safe passing for straight than to die out of the
closet.""
	If we gay people listen carefully, we can hear other voices
echo our anxiety.
	When the Jews left Egypt, many of them did so with mixed
emotions.  They were excited by the sense of independence and
self-determination which Moses promised them, but they were also
frightened of the unknown.  When they realized that Pharaoh and his army
were rapidly pursuing them, some of them yelled at Moses, ""Why did you
do this to us?  Why did you bring us out of Egypt?  Did we not tell you
this in Egypt when we said, 'Leave us alone.  Leave us serve the
Egyptians'?  Far better for us to be the slaves of the Egyptians than to
die in the desert.""
	Moses was probably hurt and confused by the frightened and angry
responses of his people.  Had he made a mistake in leaving Egypt?  Was
it better to be a slave?  Why had he left in the first place?
	It was the voice which led Moses out of Egypt, and it was the
voice in which he ultimately placed his trust.  The voice that which led
Moses and the Jews out of slavery is the exact same voice which
whispered a dream to Martin Luther King, Jr.  The voice which led an
entire nation of Jews into a 40-year wandering in the desert is the same
voice which led Ghandi to burn his English-made clothes, which led
Caesar Chavez to politically organize his family and friends in the
vineyards of California, which led Margaret Sanger to defy the law by
providing birth control information to women.
	The voice which speaks is the voice of God, which is the voice
of life, which is the voice of self-affirmation.  Moses heard the voice
say, ""I am what I am.""  Albin clears the stage in _La_Cage_Aux_Folles to
proclaim ""I am what I am.""  The voice within is a constant but generally
subtle longing to live life fully and equally; to live life
authentically and to die knowing that you have bloomed to your full
potential.
	The voice within is the persons best friend.  It is also a
troubleraker.  The voice within sings an anthem of independence.
Listening to it can prompt you to do and say things you never imagined
were within you.  Following its call to action can create all sorts of
trouble.  Family and friends will say ""You've changed.""  Employeers will
get nervous that you are getting out of line.  Priests and rabbis will
begin warning you of the sins of pride and reminding you of the perils
of heresy.
	People who listen to the voice almost always lose the security
with which society had rewarded them for staying in line; for staying in
Egypt; for staying on the plantation; for staying in the closet.  When
you listen to the voice within and decide to leave Egypt in the hope of
finding a homeland, Pharaohs chase you with their armies, voters take
away your rights, college jocks mock you and people call you names like
""militant,"" ""radical,"" ""avowed"" and ""troublemaker.""
	There is no story in the history of humankind in which people
have listened to the voice within without suffering.  All growth
requires pain.  Any time people have demanded that the world make room
for their being, society has responded with the likes of Jerry Falwell,
Jessie Helms, Cal Thomas and the other Pharaohs with whom we currently
deal.
	Likewise, every time there is a troublemaking move out of
captivity into liberation, there have always been and will always be
nagging doubts, fears and anxieties among the liberated and among those
called to liberation.  Surely there were Jews who stayed in Egypt just
as there are women who curse feminism and as there are closeted
homosexuals who hate the Movement because it threatens their security.
For every gay man or lesbian who has left the closet but at times wishes
they hadn't, there are black people in history who periodically wished
they hadn't left the security of the plantation and Indians who wished
the English had not granted their country its independence.
Self-determination is an awesome challenge and it is natural to feel
doubts and fears.
	Our generation has been tapped to lead the modern liberation
movement while at the same time cope with the horrors of AIDS.  Previous
generations have been tapped to cope with the horrors of the Crusades,
the Inquisition, the Witch Trials, the Holocaust and the McCarthy Era.
All of them died in the desert rather than serve the Egyptians.  All of
us will probably die before the others reach the Promised Land, but the
movement forward will continue, even if, at times, it is an undirected
wandering.
	Though these are dark and dreary times for many gay men and
lesbians who periodically think of the ""comforts"" of the closet, the
Pharaoh and his armies are still not enough to keep the people in
captivity.  ""I came out at the beginning of this year,"" wrote a
55-year-old stranger to me in a letter to me yesterday, ""by telling my
wife of 23 years and my two sons (21 and 22) that I am gay.  I moved
into an apartment.  I have a very special friend with whom I hope a
lasting relationship will develop.  After so many years of living
straight and being gay, I have now found a peace which I neither knew
was possible nor had any hope of achieving.""
	Welcome to the desert, friend.
________________________________________________________________________
I, and perhaps many of those gays who profess to be Christian,
have this feeling that the Christian/Jewish God is our God, even though
we seem to see a whole different aspect of Him than the right-wing edge
of Christianity.  It is often my feeling that that group of Christians
who deny others the right to be Christian in their own ways don't really
understand what/who this God they worship is, and therefore end up
standing in His way.  And that is the reason many gays (like me) spend
long hours trying to convince Christians that they should not fear us,
but should be standing in the trenches beside us working for world where
everyone has the right to be themselves and free.

That is not quite true.  He did not allow the ""ones who disobeyed"" to
enter the ""promised land"", He did not kill them out of hand as some of
the more right wing Christians propose to do to gays.  The commandments
he gave then have no mention of homosexuality (read the 10 commandments
again).

However the ongoing theme of the Gosples is that the Law is Love and Love
is Holy.  You have distorted this position.

As I have stated previously, several times, *I* am *not* a Christian.
My understanding of God, although heavily influenced by the Christian
Bible, has very little in common with traditional Christianity.  I
may write an article at some point in the future detailing my religious
beliefs, but let it suffice for the moment that my perception of the
value of Jesus Christ is His teaching that loving ones neighbors in a
positive manner (that is to say, in an active manner) is the only earthly
method of showing ones real ""love of God"".  Therefore, I find it
unbelievable that He would ask me to give up loving Steven, since this
would be a distinct contradiction of his message.
>I must ask myself this question and if there is, well, let's build
>a statue and shrine because we will have discovered our god.
>I do not fear you, but I can not call you brother, for you are not of
>the same Spirit.
Then you do not understand the ""Spirit"" as I do either.  By stating that
I am not your ""brother"" and that I am not of the ""same Spirit"" you are
being rather judgemental.  As I recollect, Jesus taught that all men are
""brothers"" (all people are children of God), not just Jews (there were
no Christians at that time).  This seems to indicate that although you
call yourself a Christian, you think that Jesus was a liar.  Is that the
case?
>If we say that we have no sin, we lie and do not the truth ( I John)
I have not made any statement of the sort that I do not not sin.  However,
my sins are between me and my God, and have nothing to do with you.  Make
sure you do not have a log in your eye before you start trying to pick the
mote out of mine.

I apologize for misunderstanding your position.
The Law is NOT love, God is love.  The Law condemns us.
Jesus did NOT teach that all men are brothers.  In a sense we
are, but only those who are followers of Jesus are Sons of God
and are His brothers.  That is the kind of brother I was referring to,
but since you are not a christian it is irrelevent.
Living to your full potential would be living your life the way
God would want wouldn't it?  Good grammer huh?
Becoming a Christian is giving up our way to follow His, because
we realize that His way is the best way.

publication in Esperanto put out by the Ligo de Samseksamaj Geesperantistoj.
Well, a copy of ""Forumo"" recently passed through my hands, so I thought I'd
mention a bit more about it.
The focus of ""Forumo"", as you might expect, seems to be an international
perspective on gay rights and culture.  The issue I saw included brief news
articles on gay issues translated from various national presses (an article
on gay rights and the U.S. Supreme Court from ""Time,"" for instance),
references to gay matters in the mainstream Esperanto press, an AIDS update,
a bit of news from the British gay bar scene, and a couple of poems.  A
great deal of attention was paid to the gay scene in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, including an article on gay terminology in various Eastern
European languages, an informal report on gay activity at a resort in
Yugoslavia, and the first in a series of excerpts dealing with gays in
Poland from the Austrian book, ""Rosa Liebe unterm Roten Stern"" (""Pink Love
Under the Red Star"").  As in any Esperanto publication, there were a number
of ""volas korespondi"" ads for pen pals; the majority of these came from
Eastern block countries.
One of the main functions of ""Forumo"", therefore, appears to be to provide a
bridge between relatively isolated gays in Soviet-bloc Europe and the
relatively open gay scene in the West.  Partly so it can achieve this,
""Forumo"" is printed in a small format and is just a few pages long, allowing
it to be sent by letter class rather than as a periodical.  It also seemed
to be rather circumspect in appearance, not printing anything that could be
called pornography or that would be certain to upset a non-Esperanto-
speaking postal censor.
If any of you are interested in the experiences of gays in Eastern Europe,
""Forumo"" seems to be a way to find out more.  Subscriptions cost three
British pounds per calendar year (four or five issues) and can be ordered
from the secretary of the LSG:
			Mr. Peter A. Danning
			G/f, 68, Church Road
			Richmond (Sy) TW10 6LN
			Great Britain
I have also seen a copy of a similar publication put out by Geja
Emancipi^go, another gay Esperanto organization.  It was somewhat less
serious in content, about half of it consisting of sexually explicit
photographs.  Peter Danning can probably provide more information if
anyone is interested.

I agree completely with \bob.  What this guy is really saying, or thinking, 
is that in reality you are looking for sex, not a roommate.  If they allow 
people to indicate that they only want to live with a male, or a female, a 
non-smoker, etc...why is being gay where they **have** to draw the line? 
It's a phoney excuse not to deal with the real issues.
KEN ARNDT asks:

Why should Robert have to ask people if they object to his life (we live 
lives, NOT lifestyles!!!!)? 
When talking to someone on the phone, it is easy enought to say, ""I am gay,
but don't have any problems living with someone who isn't.""  And leave it
at that. If they have trouble living with someone who is gay, that's their
problem, not ours. 
>>   How about, ""I don't like women.""; ""I don't like men who like women."";

I really agree with Lori on this one.  I had a straight roommate when I was 
coming out (when she moved in I *thought* I was straight also.)  Throughout 
the entire coming out process it was very hard having a straight woman 
around who was talking about going out with men, bringing men home, and 
having to deal with her boyfriend who was around quite a bit.  I think that 
if you choose to live with someone (not a friend) who is straight, there is 
a lot you have to contend with.  I'm not sure it's worth it.

This guy gets me angrier than Ken Arndt does!  I am trying to maintain my
cool, but I definately feel a flame coming on: 
Essentially what you are saying is that you have the ""best"" of both worlds; 
you enjoy HETEROSEXUAL PRIVILEDGE, but you also engage in gay sex.  From 
your het world you can say ""why do you people do such and such...."" and you 
disassociate from the gay men who you might sleep with.  It's so safe for 
you, and such a superior attitude. 
Gays have a right to be proud of themselves, to love themselves and be who 
they are.  We do not flaunt our sexuality any more than heterosexuals do.  
In fact, we do it a lot less.  Witness Robert's dilemma and the trouble he 
has put himself through all because he wanted to use a company newsletter 
that is available to anyone who works in the company.  A straight man or 
woman would have just run their ad, and never worried about a thing.
Heterosexually is everywhere...it is flaunted in every media constantly; 
gays are assulted with it to the point that we feel totally alien and 
alienated from the society.  Why shouldn't we be legal???  
You may be bisexual, but you are HOMOPHOBIC (I'm not even going to address 
your racism, that would start a lot more than a flame...probably a barn 
fire).
Flame off...simmer....

                How to Survive the Breakup of a Bad Relationship
                                 Jason
            This article doesn't come from discussions at gay rap groups
         but from my own experience and that of friends who I've helped
         deal with their breakups. I'm very happy for those who have a
         warm, loving relationship that is stable. I have found out that
         in the gay world this is a rare commodity indeed.
            I met Danny five years ago at a friend's Labor Day cookout. At
         the time I was unattached and Danny showed interest, so we talk-
         ed all through the day and exchanged the obligatory phone num-
         bers; promising to get together. I had a strange gut feel about
         the guy but couldn't put a finger on what it was. He was quite
         handsome, intelligent (or so it seemed) and charming; almost too
         charming as I remember.
            The following Friday my roomate and I had just sat down to eat
         when the phone rang. It was Danny asking if he could come over
         for a while. I asked Lauren if it was ok with him and he nodded.
         Lauren was just getting over the breakup of a very bad 2 year
         relationship with an alcoholic. He was at the party where I met
         Danny and also had funny feelings about him but wrote it off as
         just his own paranoia about getting involved.
            In four months I was very much in love and agreed to move in 
         with  Danny. Once I moved in; I started learning a lot of things
         that would have swayed my decision toward calling it quits with
         Dan. He knew what he was doing all right. He was on his best be-
         havior until he knew I was his. I first learned he had herpes
         from his brother whom I had become good friends with. His broth-
         er also told me about the pathological lieing, alcoholism, and
         psychotic episodes the family was target of. When I tried talk-
         ing to Dan about his brother and my conversations; he blew up!
         Dan told me that his brother was schizoid and had been put away
         for two years. He managed to convince me this was the truth so
         I avoided his brother for a while. I learned in time that every
         word his brother Jim told me was 100% fact.
            I would come home from work to find him quite drunk and in a
         nasty mood. Sometimes he would go out and not return for a coup-
         le of days, telling me it was none of my business where he had 
         been. He also made a point of buttering up most of my friends and
         attempted to do the same with my family; who saw through him
         from day one. Mom couldn't convince me that he was no good since
         my emotions had blinded my thinking. I was determined to make this
         relationship work and at times even Danny seemed to want to
         make an effort. His efforts were sporadic; one week he was kind
         and loving, the next impossible to live with.
            This went on for three years until I started losing my zest for
         just about everything. I started drinking more than I should and
         became moody. My performance at the office took a nosedive and
         I was warned to, ""Straighten up, or else!"" In my entire working
         career I had always been rated as an excellent worker. I knew
         that I was unhappy in the relationship but was afraid to break it
         off since Dan had threatened to cause mayhem if I did. He was
         always telling me how insecure I was; it was really him who was
         the more insecure. I made a conscious effort to remove myself from
         Dan while living with him. This gave me the emotional distance I 
         needed to make the important decision to drop out.
            Danny knew something was up with me. The day I decided to have
         the summit talks with him, he came home carrying flowers for me
         and champagne. I told him how I felt about all the shenannigans
         he'd pulled and that things would have to change. He flew into a
         rage, smashing the champagne bottle on the coffee table then
         stormed out of the apartment.
            Two days later I got a call from him. He was crying and begged
         to come back. Just for the record; this happened about once a 
         month, this time being the last. When he knew I was serious he
         threatened suicide. He came and picked up his things the follow-
         ing Saturday. Nothing was said between us and I thought I'de seen
         the last of him. Over the next few weeks I got quite a few
         phone calls from friends of mine telling me he had visited them
         telling about what a rotten person I was, about my psychotic ep-
         isodes and my alcoholism. He also called the office and told my 
         boss that I was gay and he was my lover. We had taken some Pol-
         oroids of us in bed when we first met. I never thought to look
         for them. I got a call from my mother who was very upset. You
         guessed it; he had sent the pictures to my mother. The guy was
         trying his best to ruin me before he left. The phone rang at all
         hours of the night with just silence on the other end. I called
         the police who just laughed about the two fags having a lover's
         quarrel. This went on for two months, until a friend of his drop-
         ped by to visit. He told me Dan left for San Francisco the day
         before and that he had many questions about Dan himself. We sat
         up until four a.m. and I learned a lot more about the character.
            I had met an ex-lover of Dan's once. I knew he lived in Boston
         and gave him a call. He was only too happy to have me over to
         talk. The story of his year with Danny was a carbon copy of what
         I was going through. After Dan finished trying to ruin Ralph, he
         hopped a plane for Chicago; two years before meeting me. Danny
         told me that he had always lived in Massachusetts when we met. I
         learned that he had lived all over the country, raising havoc with
         every life he touched, then moving on.
            That's one of my stories. It seems very similar to ones that
         friends have told me about past lovers. I swear there must be a
         factory somewhere in Detroit that manufactures these people.
         Now ole Jason will share some hints on how to recover from such
         an affair.
         * The two of you have had the same serious fight for the 175 th
           time, you've broken up 3 or 4 times and things always seemed
           to be better for a few weeks after you got back together but
           you don't feel like you can handle another round. Fine! it may
           be time to part company. If the guy is sane, then the two of
           you can shake hands, hug and fade into each other's history.
           You might even go on to become bosem buddies. If he's at all
           like Danny, read on.
         * If you fear that your lover may be violent when you break the 
           news that it's over, have a friend nearby who is willing to 
           take you in for a while. You may want to tell him in a semi-  
           public place where there are other people present; preferably
           not a bar.
         * Warn your friends that he may be dropping by to tell his tale
           of woe. If they're really your friends you won't be hearing
           what a hot lay he was from them. They probably will show him 
           the way to the door.
 
         * You may also be hearing from his friends after the breakup. Be
           very careful on the phone when talking to them; he may be lis-
           tening on an extension and trying to get the goods on you. Be
           polite but brief unless you really know his friends better than
           you knew him.
         * He may try to contact your family; giving all the sordid det-
           ails of the relationship. If you're not out to Mom, this may
           be a good time to come out gracefully to her,""Uh! Mom, you know my
           roomate Larry, weeeelllll there's something I've been wanting
           to share with you about him and I"". She's probably figured
           it out after visiting your one bedroom apartment anyway.
         * Once the bum's out get his keys back, then have the locks 
           changed. This is very important if your now, ex is anything
           like my Danny. It can ruin your whole day to come home from
           work to find only a lone coffee table in the living room, the
           one he smashed the champagne bottle on. Also have the phone
           number changed; preferably to an unlisted one. This will help
           keep harassment to a minimum via the phone. 
         * If you're afraid he'll call the office, it helps to be out to
           your boss. I was working for a woman at the time when I warned
           her about Danny calling. She told me that she had dated a guy
           much like Dan and that she'd take care of the twerp. What she
           did was cruel but I loved it. He called her as I feared he 
           would. My boss just said,""Oh really, uh huh, uh huh, well I'm
           sleeping with him now!"" She told me Dan hung up post haste. If
           you're not out to the boss you can always warn he or she that an
           escaped lunatic may call claiming to be God. It just helps to
           warn the boss that some slightly deluded individual may call
           and to ignore them.
         * Make sure all your valuables are in a safe place like at Mom's
           house when the shit hits the fan. Take inventory of all valu-
           able receipts, titles, bank and check books, etc and put them
           somewhere out of reach. Go see Mom again.
         * If he's left anything behind, don't throw it away for a while,
           at least until you're sure he's gone for good. He may be back
           looking for his stuff later and raise a real stink if you've
           canned everything.
         * If you own anything jointly, get an agreement in writing of who
           gets the property. You can only do this if the ex is rational
           and isn't carrying a gun. The same goes for money in joint
           savings/checking accounts. Better still, if the two of you hav-
           en't been together for an appreciable length of time, then
           separate accounts are a wiser decision. Users will usually press-
           ure you from the beginning to pool your resources; beware!
         * If he starts pleading to come back and you've been through the
           same melodrama with him before, be firm in letting him know
           it's over but don't threaten, ""If I see your fucking face ar-
           ound here I'll kill you"". This will only get the turkey upset
           and start him gobbling all the more. Try to let him think that
           there may be a chance in the future (like the year 2013) that
           the two of you may be able to make a go of it again. These guys
           don't handle rejection very well, much worse than the rest of
           us.
 
         * Another ploy he may use is the,""Let's just sleep together one
           time"" routine. It's wise to just say NO! With your jumbled up
           emotions, you'll probably take him back again for the 147 th 
           time and wind up where you started. Remember that this guy can
           probably read you like a book and play you like a piano. Being
           firm will let him know in a very short time that you mean bus-
           iness. You have seen through him and he's aware that others
           have also. He's terrified of going it alone again because he
           may not be so lucky landing another sucker in the future. He'll
           be forced to face himself and users don't want to do that; do
           they. Resist the Siren's song at all costs.
         * Well! you're all alone now in this big apartment, right! Take
           my advice and don't go rushing out to fill the void with an-
           other warm body. Nature abhors a vacuum and so do newly part-
           ed lovers. You're very vulnerable now and risk attracting an
           even worse turkey. These users/losers can smell an easy mark
           ten miles away and will try sweet talking their way into your
           life. It's now time for you to take stock of yourself. Chances
           are that when the two of you were together, you didn't have much
           time for yourself. Indulge in a hobby, call a long neglected
           friend over for dinner, take a night course, etc. The import-
           ant thing right now is to fill your time with things you enjoy
           doing. 
         * You may go through a period of promiscuity where you'll screw
           anything that stands still long enough. This is fine as long 
           as it  doesn't become a habit or depressing. Make sure you're
           not looking for the deep loving sex you had with what's his
           name while sowing your wild oats. Whoring around has become
           somewhat of a hazard with the advent of AIDS. If you don't
           feel good about being a slut for a while, then don't!
         * You may try getting involved with a gay social group if there's
           one convenient to you. This will offer you a non bar social
           outlet, unless the ex shows up; then go back home and watch
           Dynasty. Chances are that the ex will move off to places un-
           known; especially if he's like Danny.
         * Allow yourself to mourn the loss of a relationship. You've
           probably put a lot of effort into it and it's ok to feel bad
           even though the guy was a loser. After a while you may feel
           anger, even rage when you realize the ride you were taken on.
           It's ok to be mad. Call up a friend and let him know how you
           feel. If the bad feelings become obsessive, call a shrink if
           necessary. He'll let you be angry and might give you one of
           those foam rubber bats to smack the chair with in effigy to
           your ex.
         * I find that working with people who are hurting worse than me
           helps get my mind off my own loss. It might help to volunteer
           time manning a hot-line, visiting the elderly or doing volun-
           teer work with handicapped people.
         * Now is also a good time to stay away from alcohol and drugs.
           They may make the hurt go away right now, but only prolong it
           in the long run.
 
         * If you've had a continuous track record of Dannys, then it's
           now time to do some serious soul searching into the reasons
           that you attract these losers in the first place. Are you an
           emotional masochist, are you too nice and trusting a person?
           These guys will walk a mile to attach themselves to people like
           you. This may be the time to be a little more cynical, as bad
           as it may sound. Friends may be able to add some insight into
           why a nice guy like you attracts these jerks.
         * If Mr. loser disappears into a black hole somewhere, don't be 
           afraid to look up an old ex of his or chat with his friends.
           This isn't prying so much as it is therapy. They may share in-
           formation with you that will help you get over the ex in a much
           shorter time. It's ok to reality test.
         * Lastly, I hope you learn from your mistakes as I have. I'm much
           better off because of Danny. The relationship with him taught me
           many valuable lessons about what I do/don't want out of life.
         * When you do meet who you may think is Mr. Wonderful, don't rush
           into the vine covered cottage after 2 weeks. Take time to get to 
           him as a friend, date, court; it can be lots of fun and when the
           two of you decide to bed down together, much more satisfying.
           Even if the two of you never sleep together, you may have gained
           a valuable new friend. Remember you may not have a lover but you
           can never have too many good friends
                             ***************************","MnUgb5gzGpkJ",14,1985-02-11,-26,13

there are two.  the first is to love the lord your god with your whole

GOD-DAMNED, SELF-RIGHTEOUS, POMPOUS BULLSHIT that was handed to you

as much as himself -- YOUR FELLOW MAN...
so call me a CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  you're a HOMOPHOBE!!!  and you're damned,
right, I AM A CHRISTOPHOBE!!!  (I do have friends who are Christian,

talked to)...i'm scared to death that one day my sexual preference will
be OUTLAWED!!!  i'm already uneasy holding hands with my boyfriend in

to hide our feelings for each other just because of what society thinks...
if you had your way, i might get ARRESTED for that!!!!  and why shouldn't
i be able to kiss him if i like??  don't you touch or kiss or hold hands
with YOUR Significant Other (wife, gf, whatever) in public??
just don't expect a warm welcome on my front porch when you come to tell
me i'm doomed to hell, or three of you get together with a bunch of chains
and beat up some of my friends coming out of a gay bar or you assault the
youngest of us (gay men and lesbians) that are part of your own flesh as
well, deny them their right to live and love as they choose and leave
them with scars that perhaps will never be erased...
if i was to come to your door bearing such glad tidings, i bet that you'd
pretend that you weren't home, too....

particularly new or novel to readers of net.motss, is not a central
purpose of net.motss, and has been successfully exorcised several
times before.  Right now it seems to be precariously contained to
net.religion.christian, where both sides of the discussion can

What ever happened to it?  It's still active.  True, there are folk who will
decide that they should be the instruments of God's wrath.  On the other hand,
there are those who believe that they have to speak the truth as they see it,
just as you believe that you must be true to yourself.
Please, save your anger for the former group.  The latter are just as sincere
as you are, whether you can understand it or not.  They believe that they have
a duty, both to God and to YOU to speak as they do.

That circular track, for some lucky  people, is the belief that they should
have nothing on their minds bigger than God.  As to  ``how holy thou art'' ...
where do you draw the line between believing that you are doing the right thing
and being self-righteous?  It isn't always obvious.

And there are PLENTY of Christians who will do the same thing.  That's
compassion and common sense and it does not contradict our instructions from
God.  Remember, Jesus ate with those ``known'' to be sinners.

For the thoughtful Christian, this is the crux of a moral dilemma:  Does
this orientation, not of an individual's choosing, give someone the burden
of obeying very severe laws that others are not burdened by?  Or does it give
them the right to contravene statements that appear (to many, anyway) to be
clear prohibitions?

Hmm.  I don't know anyone who does that.  As I said, there are dilemmas
involved, but there's a difference between ``We don't want society to say
what you're doing is right.'' and ``We want to burn you at the stake because
we want to see you burn in Hell.''
>i'm scared to death that one day my sexual preference will be OUTLAWED!!!
For what it's worth, it was (and probably still is).  Most people nowadays
are content to let things go on behind closed doors.  This wasn't always
true ... look at Oscar Wilde and Alan Turing.

I doubt that you are speaking to your audience here.  It's unlikely that too
many people on this net are doing many of the things that you have described.
And the people engaging in assuaults such as those you describe are NOT
behaving in a very Christian manner, so perhaps flaming at Christians is not
speaking to your audience either.

What?  You don't eat, put your pants (or nylons) on one leg at a time,

Unfortunately, most Christians ignore the rest of that book of the Bible,
eating pork and shellfish, milk at the same meal as meat (and on the same
dishes, even), and only pick out these half dozen verses to claim as God's
Law out of Leviticus.  Isn't this a bit hypocritical?

You just want society to say that because what we are doing is 'not right'
(according to you), we should be allowed to be fired from our jobs, thrown
out of our houses...  Not quite burning at the stake, is it?  Burning is
faster!

Forutunately, even in those states where it is still illegal, the courts
are throwing such laws out (Texas was the last).  And I agree, Christian
intolerance has been going on for far to long.

But I know lots of young people who have been thrown out of their
Christian parents home because they were gay, often after being
subjected to avertion therapy, electo-shock therapy, or prayer
marathons.  Sorry, but they call themselves Christians and go to
Church 4 times a week and read their Bibles.  Jerry Falwell, that
'great Chrittian fellow' in the news for the last few years, tells
lies on his pulpit.  I can only go by what they tell me, since enough
of them act the same way, I assume its a Christian trait.  Even you
seem to want to 'keep me in my place' ('we don't want society to
endorse what you do').
Fuck off Christian!

6th.  It's addressed to all voters who think they may vote for Reagan,
but especially to closet Republicans, [Ll]ibertarians, and gay people.
(The views expressed herein are my own, & not those of my employer.)
			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

    though it were gospel? 
    Personally,  I  have  a lot of problems with  studies which seek a 
    single  ""causitive  factor""  (in this case a biological basis) for 
    just  about  anything.  Often, they use a small sample population, 
    and  use no control groups. They receive a great deal of attention 
    because they seem to be providing an easy ""scientific"" answer to a 
    complex  ""problem"".   This  particular  study  which  looks at the 
    mother's hormonial balance as a ""cause"" of homosexuality (blame it 
    **all**  on  mom...now  it's  her  hormones,  before  it  was  her 
    domineering  personality)  seems  to  look  only at gay men.  What 
    about  lesbians?  Why do so many ""scientific"" studies look only at 
    men, and then generalize about humanity? 
    Personally,  I  don't  care  if being gay is a ""result"" of what my 
    mother  ate  when she was pregnant, how she brought me up, or that 
    she was wearing blue when I was conceived. 
    What  I DO care about is that there is at least 10% of the world's 
    population  which defines itself as gay, and probably more who are 
    bisexual.   That  we have chosen to lead a life (NOT A LIFESTYLE!) 
    that  suits our needs and makes us HAPPY (one might even say *gay* 
    :-} ), is what is important.  I do not feel the need to justify my 
    life  through  ""scientific"", ""sociological"", or any other kinds of 
    studies. 
    I think  that  Heather Emanuel raised some good questions, though, 
    and I wanted to respond to two of them: 
                 >> == Heather Emanuel 
                 >>How  did  you all decide you were gay? 
                 >>Was it your own decision? 
    This  is the same question that a friend of long standing asked me 
    after  I  came  out  (I was 28 at the time, and none of my friends 
    ""suspected"", at least, not out loud). 
    For  *many*  people  it is more a question of finally admitting to 
    yourself  that  you  are gay, or recognizing the fact, rather than 
    ""deciding"".  What one can decide is to accept the fact, and choose 
    to  live your life as a gay man or lesbian; how you choose to live 
    is where the decision making comes in. 
    Remember  that  sexuality  is a continuum, it is not an either/or, 
    hetero/homo  ""fact"". There is a great deal of room on the contiuum 
    for  people to be celibate, bisexual; asexual, very sexual, sexual 
    only with men, only with women....etc. 
    Deciding to come out is hard for some people, easy for others.  It 
    took  me  28  years  because I had believed the stereo types about 
 
    gays  and took the homophonic remarks for truths. I was very homo- 
    phobic  before I came out, and ""knew"" that since I wasn't like the 
    stereo  types, I couldn't be ""one of them"".  Once I was willing to 
    see  myself  as gay, I was able to break through all that sh*t and 
    see  that  the stereo types were just not true.  I don't think you 
    have to come out to realize all this, but I think that you have to 
    be  willing  to  accept yourself and other people for who and what 
    you/they are.

    Yes.  Society  and  families ""tell"" children that they are hetero- 
    sexual from the moment they are born (and before).  It is a given. 
    Children  who do not feel ""that way"" are told that they are ""going 
    through  a phase"", that they will feel ""differently"" when they get 
    older.   Or,  worse  yet, they are told that they are sick and are 
    sent to shrinks or put into mental institutions (that happens less 
    today,  but  there were a great number of gay men and lesbians who 
    were  actually  committed  to  institutions  because they dared to 
    define their sexual preferences in a ""socially unacceptable"" way). 
    Heterosexuality  is  so  pervasive  in this society, while gay and 
    lesbian culture so invisible, that many people who are gay grow up 
    thinking  they must be the ""only one in the world"".  What a thrill 
    and relief to find out you are not alone...how sad for the gay men 
    and women who find it out late in life. 
    Heather:   If  you  have kids, do the best you can, and trust that 
    you have given them the best you have...after that, it's all up to 
    them.   No  parent,  no  matter  how  caring, how careful has ever 
    raised the ""perfect"" kid.

32% of homosexual men in SF earn more than $30K, with 31% earning $20-$30K.
57% graduated from college, incl. 21% who continued in post-grad education.
42% of homosexual men in SF report they are in monogamous relationships and
13% have one primary relationship that includes outside sexual activity.
78% have all-male sexual partners, 14% are bisexual with mostly male partners
and 7% are bisexual with mostly female partners.
More than half of the homosexual men are in professional-managerial positions
or operate their own businesses.  Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.
About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,
with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.
A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliability
of the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed off
to them because they're gay.""  However, he also noted that many affluent
homosexuals were moving into San Francisco.

I believe the 69,960 were ADULT, MALE SELF-DESCRIBED HOMOSEXUALS.
Non-adults were not surveyed.

It is important to note a few important things about that survey:
1) that the survey was NOT a random sample,
2) the 500 were TELEPHONE interviews and more than 10% of the 
   salaries reported have already been declared as inflated
   and the investigation has just begun...think about it -
   if you weren't making much money and someone asked you
   how much you were making, in a telephone interview, wouldn't
   you be inclined to inflate it a little bit???
Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms,
and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia
from growing up in a world determined to assume that
everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are
all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia -
like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the
view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia
could be used against us...
just a thought from a lesbian here in sf...

			PART SEVEN
[NYNative, 12/19/83-1/1/84, Randy Shilts, ""Memos Show Administration Falsi-
fied AIDS Funding Needs, pp. 18-19,64]
At the end of 1983, the real story behind the Reagan administration's AIDS
effort (or, rather, lack of one) finally came out after literally years of
criticisms & fears.  ""Most of the darkest suspicions that scientists & gay
activists had long voiced about the lack of commitment to AIDS research by
the Reagan administration were confirmed....A stark portrait of government
duplicity which was quietly accepted by AIDS researchers in the CDC emerges
....""
This information had to be obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request
by Congress & from a 33-page report issued by Weiss' HSGOH.  ""CDC fiercely
opposed"" the FIA request, & was FORCED to surrender the desired memoranda
when the CDC refusal was appealed & publication of some of the memos by
Weiss' HSGOH in their report seemed imminent.
The released information revealed:
1. ""Some of the same officials who assured Congress that the federal gov't
had all the AIDS money it needed were privately pleading for more funds
from budget officials.""  CDC AIDS Task Force coord. Dr. James Curran notably
indulged in this form of prevarication, almost constantly claiming he had
or would soon receive funds that he knew didn't even exist!
2. ""Within 5 months of its formation, the CDC's AIDS Task Force (ATF) was
vainly begging the agency management for more funds & shortages have seri-
ously retarded the CDC's efforts throughout the AIDS epidemic.""
3. ""Much of the money that the CDC did spend on AIDS was diverted from
other important health needs.""
4. ""The failure to expediate funds for AIDS research meant that no
significant outlay of funds reached researchers until March 1983--
almost two years after AIDS was first detected.""
5. ""Serious misunderstandings about which federal agencies would handle
various aspects of the AIDS epidemic also seriously delayed research.""
CDC has received a ""good press"" from the media (excluding the gay press
which knew better, & was virtually alone in being critical & following
events closely), yet all during this period (1981-3) it was in fact
starved for funds.
Here's a closer history of events as revealed in internal HHS memos:
As early as June 1981 the CDC knew that AIDS was a serious epidemic:
they'd assigned staffers to it from its VD project.  By December
""when the number of cases had soared"", they were aware of the
magnitude of the task.  But they severely lacked funds.  Curran sub-
mitted a 6-months budget for a piddling $833,300.  But HHS did not
respond.  AT ALL.  Finally, Congress allocated $500,000 in August,
8 months late.  REAGAN VETOED THE APPROPRIATION.
Congress overturned the veto, & Curran finally received the money in
September.  By that time, the number of cases had quintupled.
Funding for 1983 ""fared little better"".  Administration budget cutters 
forced CDC to recalculate its budget THREE TIMES, the final AIDS figure
being 60% below the original one.  CDC Aids Task Force director Dr.
William Rushing included the following with his budget proposal:  ""As
you know, the attached budget is insufficient to adequately fund AIDS
surveillance & epidemiologic studies.  However, we will continue with\the
highest priority activities until additional funds become available.""
Finally Congress alllocated $2 million more for the CDC in December 1982;
""like other money that Congress would later appropriate, however, the
AIDS funding came in spite of the statements of federal health officials,
not because of them.""
In August 1982 the CDC wanted to set up a national AIDS surveillance
system, but had no money for it.  For the next 18 months, CDC ""depended
on doctors & health officials to call them up & tell them about AIDS
cases..."", an absurd situation for a federal health agency to be in
during a national epidemic.
""We lost all that data -- two years of cases are now irretrievable. All
that time I was saying we should do the work & Curran was telling us he
didn't have the money,"" said Dr. David Ostrow, an AIDS researcher at
Northwestern.
Researchers weho do get funds got inadequate ones:  SF's Dr. Andrew Moss
received $30,000 to monitor AIDS epidemiology for the CDC.  ""They give
you $30,000 -- it;s such an interesting sum.  It's too much to turn down,
but not enough to do anything meaningful.  It's similar to everything
about AIDS.""
The CDC AIDS Tsk Force's major piece of work, a case control study, was
published 18 months after it was finished;  epidemiologists criticized
its findings as ""sorely out of date"".
The Reagan administration's AIDS effort continued to be ""malnourished,
slipsod, disorganized, & bogged down by cumbersome bureaucracy"" in
1983.  By May, Brandt was alarmed & wrote to the HHS asst. sec. for
mamangement & budget:  ""It has now reached the point where important
AIDS work cannot be undertaken because of the lack of available re-
sources.""  Then CDC director Dr. William Foege added a long list of
projects ""postponed, delayed, or seriously curtailed"" because ""money
was diverted to AIDS.  These included studies on hepatitis, influ-
enza among the elderly, & rabies.""
""Just two weeks later, however, Thomas Donelly, who is in charge of
budgets at HHS, wrote a senate staffer that `we are not in favor of
additional appropriations' for AIDS research.""
""Brandt, Foege, & other health officials were also testifying before
Congress that they had enough funds for AIDS even while they were
privately begging for more money.""
In late May the House was about to pass an appropriation of an extra
$12 million for AIDS; at this time Brandt wrote ""that while the HHS
was not requesting more funds, they would `not oppose' having the
authority to transfer $12 million from other parts of the budget
into AIDS""!!
In September, HSGOH decided to add $22 million to the administration's
$17 million request (""only a 20 % increase over the previous year's
budget levels"").  HSGOH ""staffers think Republican committee members
leaked word to the administration because days later, Margaret Heckler.
secretary of HHS, made a highly-publicized announcement that the adminis-
tration would commit $40 million to AIDS research next year.  Heckler's
announcement did not mention thatthis allocation was a FAIT ACCOMPLI
because of the secret House vote--and it did not mention that even the
$40 million was $10 million BELOW whatthe CDC requested for AIDS research.""
""`Normally when you have an epidemic, the health people are begging you
for money', fumed Congresswoman Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, who co-
sponsored legislation for more AIDS funding.  `Here we were begging them
for information on what they needed & they kept telling us that they didn't
need any money.  It was unbelievable.'""
""In Washington, Dr. Edward Brandt, the administration's top health official,
brushed aside suggestions that he had been dishonest about the federal AIDS
effort.  He didn't need to ask for money, he insisted, because Congress
gave it to him anyway.
`By the time I put in a request & it goes through all the processes,
Congress passes the money [indeed!],' Brandt told the Native.  `It's
difficult to ever say you have enough money.  In one sense, as long as
you have the disease, you could say we don't have enough money.  All I
can say is that the money is there now.'""
""Though most scientists agree that the long-delayed money is now coming
from the federal government, some think that the government has irretriev-
ably lost its credibility with the scientific community.""
""Weiss' report requests that the gov't institute policies to expedite
funding of research grants &, most significantly, establish an independent
[of CDC, HHS] commission to map an overall strategy to fight AIDS.... The
budget would THEN BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO CONGRESS, CIRCUMVENTING THE
REAGAN BUDGET SLASHERS [my italics].  The panel itself implicitly reflects
the most serious charge within just about every paragraph of [HSGOH's]
report: the Reagan administration has been lying through its teeth about
the adequacy of AIDS funding for 2 years.""
There is much more information & events described in Shilts' article.
But the hour grows late, & my fingers are getting tired.
As some kind of a bench mark to make sense of the dollar amounts mentioned
above, a while ago HHS asked for funds merely to develop a few tests for
animal experiments preparatory to the real bulk of research; they asked for
at least $197 million.  Also remember that Congressional appropriations
amounts are limited by a factor the administration isn't:  the constant
obstacle of a Reagan veto.
[Gay Community News, 10/27/84, Jim Ryan, ""Health Director Resigns"", p. 1]
Ass't Sec. of HHS Dr. Edward Brandt, the nation's top physician, resigns
at the end of this year.  For all his shortcomings in performance & his
prevaricating, Brandt is a competent professional who showed a willingness
to work with gay organizations and was free of political ideology, if not
influence.
""The direction & extent of the gov't's research [on AIDS] depends in no
small measure on who is appointed to replace Brandt.... Any decision on
a successor will emanate from the Oval Office.""  That is, on tomorrow's
election result.
""Many fear"" Reagan will nominate C. Everett Koop, currently Surgeon Gene-
ral.  He's been ""widely criticized for his opposition to abortion, for
making numerous homophobic remarks, & for close ties to fundamentalist
Christian organizations.
Brandt was given credit for obtaining more AIDS funds at one point:  he
leaked a letter he wrote to his boss, Margaret Heckler, forcing Heckler's
hand.  Apparently Brandt thought there was good reason to believe Heckler
would deny or (more probably) ignore his request for more funds.  Heckler
had previously sat on an urgent AIDS funds request for six months doing
nothing; in that period of time, 500 more people had died of AIDS.

Noting the landslide victory (electoral votes) and large margin

assume that US voters prefer Reagan to Mondale.  If you truly believe

Oh boy, America love it or leave it, eh?  You know, it's not that
easy.  Most other countries aren't too keen on granting political
asylum to yanks, and in general make it difficult to find steady
employment.  And they know when they've got a good thing.  This ""you
choose to live here"" business is nonsense.  The fact that I am free
to visit most any place in the world does not mean I can become a
citizen there, let alone work.
US is best?  Most desirable?  How do you know, not to mention rank
order?  The US is not best on most of the popular health statistics
(like lifespan or infant mortality indices), nor per capita income,
not to mention crime.  There are many other democracies that appear
to be about as politically and economically free as the US, and with a
much better quality of life.
Ah, but *we* can blow every one of 'em to kingdom come with the

Why do people always say this?  Everyone has the freedom to think what
they want.  I, too, think this is at least one of the best (if not the
best) countries in the world to live in.  One of the things I don't
think is so great about it is the fact that Ronald Reagan is president.
I am not a 'political animal' and admittedly not very good at defending 
my beliefs (mainly because I don't like to argue with people).  But this
doesn't mean I'm wrong, and it also doesn't mean I have no right to live
in this country.  I don't think it's right of you to deny another
citizen the right to complain.  After all, if nobody ever complained,
nothing would ever change, and we would still be toggling programs into
our computers.

I completely agree with you here, too.  I believe that responsible
disagreement is the source of all progress.  
I also believe that people who can, do, and people who can't try to 
tear down those who can.  What I was trying to oppose was the gratuitious 
criticism in the absence of constructive alternatives.  I even support 
criticism of the ""I think something is wrong here, but I'm not sure what 
to do about it."" variety.  But it doesn't seem to me that Ron's
comments fall into either category.  And when, after the election, he
posted that sour grapes article, I felt moved to reply.
For those of you who might like to know, I think:
 - given the alternatives, US voters made the superior chioce.
 - neither party has a viable foreign policy, but I'm not sure exactly
   how I want it changed
 - the most pressing problem facing the US right now is
   government mismanagement of fiscal affairs
 - elimination of nuclear weapons is mandatory, the focus should
   be on getting both the US & the USSR to agree to ANY necessary
   technique for verifying compliance, treaties should include
   specific numbers of specific weapons and prohibition against
   ANY upgrade or enhancement or deployment of ANY new offensive
   weapon or system, defensive technology should be public knowledge;
   NOW WHO HAS ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO GET THE USSR TO AGREE?

    Many different kinds of postings happen on our slightly improbable net.
Occaisional light banter in Danish is fun, if only for the absurdity of doing
such a thing. There is no real information anyway, so no harm is done.
    On t'other hand, any time I intend to convey information, I will
do it in a language my recipients understand. To do otherwise would be
self-defeating.
    This process is actually self-enforcing. Anybody who wants to be
listened to will discover sooner or later that it helps if your recipient
can understand what you say. If somebody is not interested in helping
you understand him/her even that much, you probably have little to lose
by ignoring her/him.
re: article that raised the issue:
    The first Spiegel article was interesting enough [to me] to read,
but not to translate. (sorry! The gist was that AIDS is alive and
well in the German Fed. Republic, affecting both men and women. I
don't remember whether they also broke it down by sexual preference.)
I skipped the second article because I get eyestrain from variable spacing
between words. (Was that for anybody who made it past the language barrier:-?)

Fed up sex expert charges...
GAYS ARE WORSE THAN MURDERERS
    Homosexuals are prancing around the U.S. spreading the most monstrous
plague the world has ever known, says an outraged sexuality expert.
And, he says, ""They're worse than murderers.""
    ""Gay meeting areas, gay bars, gay baths should be closed immediately
and it should be illegal to be a homosexual,"" said Dr. Paul Cameron.
    And homosexuals should be required by the government to register
so that their movements could be tracked to halt the growing threat
of AIDS ( the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ), gonorrhea,
syphilis and hepatitis, he said.
    Cameron, who has a Ph.D. degree in sociology from the
University of Colorado, is chairman of the Institute for
Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, Nebr. [ I wonder
if they investigate sexuality anywhere else? :-) ]
    ""Most murderers commit a crime and are punished, but gays are
promiscuous and do bad deeds constantly, and as such, are worse
than murderers.
    ""Whenever gays take over an organization, they trash it,"" he
said.  ""I haven't met one yet who wasn't a fairly vicious person.""
    Statistics put together by Cameron's institute reveal a
shocking 5 percent of America's 210 million population is
either bisexual or homosexual.
    Latest figures show an incredible rise in the number of
dreaded AIDS cases so far this year - 2,886 comapred to 1,390
this time last year, according to Cameron.
    ""AIDS is a horrible plague on society,"" said Cameron.
    ""A shocking 40 to 60 percent of all gays show evidence of
infection from the AIDS virus.
    ""This terrible desease is costing American taxpayers $7
million a week for treatment.""
    Cameron recently testified before the Maine Human Rights
Commission regarding a gay rights bill to stop job
discrimination against homosexuals in that state.
    ""Such a bill would give gays preferred status in jobs and
that would allow them to get a better crack at our kids, handle
our food and blood,"" he said.  ""It would legitimize people who
are doing something socially worthless.  And it ( the bill ) would
be of tremendous disservice to the homosexuals who might otherwise
be pressured by society to go straight.""
    Fortunately, Cameron told the NEWS, his only son is a normal,
healthy young man.
    ""We practice the Christian faith in our family and if my son were
gay, it would be one of the most horrible things that could happen,""
he said.  ""If it had happened, my son would be disowned.""

A Survey of the Criminal Laws of the United States
Affecting Homosexuals
by Daniel Meyer, Esq.
(This is the third installment of Dan Meyer's survey of the criminal
laws relating to homosexuality in the various states.  We continue our
review of the New England states with Massachusetts, which requires
enough discussion to carry over into the discussion next month.--Editor)
Massachusetts
Massachusetts has not by statute decriminalized consensual sexual acts
in private.  It *seems*, however, to have done so by judicial decisions
that hold that, as a matter of statutory construction, the provisions of
the criminal law against ""deviant"" sexual acts do not apply to such acts
when committed in private between consenting adults.  The word ""seems""
is used because the decisions are not absolutely clear.
1. The Question Whether Consensual Sexual Acts in Private Have Been
Decriminalized.
   A. The Statutes Prohibiting Deviant Sexual Acts.
The pertinent statutes are of ancient origin, as their rather archaic
language suggests, and are quoted here in full to show their extreme
vagueness and generality (except for the sodomy statute) which required
the courts, in order to save them from unconstitutionality for
vagueness, to delineate the specific acts within their purview, and
which afforded the courts the opportunity to exclude from their reach
consensual acts between adults in private.
The statutes in question are contained in Chapter 272 of the General
Laws of Massachusetts (G.L.c.272).  They read as follows (with emphasis
supplied to indicate the particular language held to prohibit deviant
sexual acts):
S 16. Lascivious Cohabitation and Lewdness.
A man and woman who, not being married to each other, lewdly and
lasciviously associate and cohabitate together, or *a man or woman,
married or unmarried, who is guilty of open and gross lewdness and
lascivious behavior*, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state
prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two
years or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.
S 34. Sodomy and Buggery.
Whoever commits the abominable and detestable crime against nature
either with mankind or with a beast, shall be punished by imprisonment
in the state prison for not more than twenty years.
S 35. Unnatural and Lascivious Acts.
Whoever commits *any unnatural and lascivious act with another person*
shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than
one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more
than five years or in jail or the house of correction for not more than
two and one half years.
S 53. Common Night Walkers, Common Railers and Brawlers, etc.
Common night walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers,
persons who with offensive and disorderly act or language accost or
annoy persons of the opposite sex, *lewd, wanton and lascivious persons
in speech or behavior*, idle and disorderly persons, prostitutes,
disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses and
persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a
jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine
of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
   B. The Cases Decriminalizing Consensual Acts in Private.
(1) Cases Under G.L.c.272, S 35.
The leading case is *Commonwealth v. Balthazar*, 318 N.E.2d 478 (Mass.
1974).  There, the complainant, a woman who had accepted a ride in the
defendant's car, charged that he had compelled her by threats to commit
fellatio on him and to put her ""tongue on his backside.""  The defendant
was convicted of committing an ""unnatural and lascivious act with
another person"" under G.L.c.272, S 35.  He argued on appeal that the
statute was unconstitutionally vague in not specifying the particular
acts to which it applied and also that the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that consent by the victim would bar a conviction
under S 35.
The Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the conviction holding that S
35 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the case because,
according to the Court, both earlier court decisions and contemporary
community standards sufficiently apprised the defendant that the
particular acts of which he was accused were considered ""unnatural and
lascivious"" within the meaning of S 35.  ""By compelling the victim to
put her mouth on his genitals and on his buttocks or anus, the defendant
sought sexual gratification in a manner which,"" according to the court,
""deviated from accepted conduct in the community."" 318 N.E.2d at 482.
The SJC went out of its way, however, in what was strictly speaking a
*dictum*, but a *dictum* that seems to have evolved into settled law, to
declare that, in the light of contemporary community values, ""...we
conclude that S 35 must be construed to be inapplicable to private
consensual conduct of adults.  We do so on the ground that the concept
of general community disapproval of specific sexual conduct, which is
inherent in S 35, requires such an interpretation.  We do not decide
whether a statute which explicitly prohibits specific sexual conduct,
even if consensual and private, would be constitutionally infirm."" 318
N.E.2d at 481.  The court did not express any opinion on the question
whether S 34, the sodomy statute, which explicitly prohibits specific
sexual conduct but does not, to be sure, expressly prohibit such conduct
when consensual and private, could be limited by statutory construction
to exclude consensual acts between adults in private.
The SJC's declaration that S 35 is inapplicable to consensual acts in
private would seem to have supported the defendant's claim that the
trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the victim's
consent would bar a conviction under that section.  The SJC held,
however, that even assuming the acts in question occurred in private,
the defendant was precluded from asserting the defense of consent in the
SJC because he had failed at the trial to request such an instruction or
to take exception to the trial judge's failure so to charge.
Thereafter, the defendant sought habeus corpus in the federal courts on
the ground that S 35 was unconstitutionally vague.  *Balthazar v.
Superior Court*, 428 F.Supp.425 (D.Mass. 1977), *aff'd*, 573 F.2d 698
(1st Cir. 1978).  The district court granted the writ and reversed the
conviction, and was affirmed on appeal.  Those decisions were based on a
finding that although the SJC had narrowed the scope of S 35 by
excluding from its reach private consensual conduct, the section was
nevertheless unconstitutionally vague at the time of the defendant's
alleged acts because its broad and general language had not been defined
specifically to apply to the conduct complained of.  However, the
district court declared (428 F.Supp. at 434):
	The court is not willing, however, to hold that Mass.
	Gen.Laws ch. 272, S 35 is invalid today merely because
	it was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner in
	July of 1972.  Much has transpired in the courts of 
	the Commonwealth since the date of the petitioner's
	alleged conduct, which  has lent specificity and meaning
	to a once ambiguous statute.  The most significant
	occurrence came in *Commonwealth v. Deschamps*,
	294 N.E.2d 426 (Mass.App.Ct. 1972), where fellatio was
	held to constitute an unnatural act.  Other recent
	cases have definitively applied S 35 to specific
	conduct.  *Commonwealth v. LaBella*, 364 Mass. 550,
	306 N.E.2d 813 (1974) (applying S 35 to cunnilingus).
	Furthermore, as was previously discussed, S 35 was
	significantly altered by the Supreme Judicial Court's
	opinion in *Balthazar*, limiting the statute's
	reach to non-consensual conduct.  The clear impact
	of these decisions was to put the public on notice
	that S 35 forbids specific types of non-consensual
	sexual conduct, including fellatio.
In *Commonwealth v. Reilly, 363 N.E.2d 1126 (Mass.App. 1977), the court,
citing *Balthazar*, squarely held that ""consensual conduct in private
between adults is not prohibited by... S 35..."" and that the refusal of
the trial judge so to charge constituted reversible error.  *See also,
Commonwealth v. Scagliotti*, 371 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. 1977).
(2) Cases Under G.L.c.272, SS 16 and 53.
In *Commonwealth v. Templeman*, 381 N.E.2d 1300 (mass. 1978), the agreed
facts, based largely on the testimony of the victim, were that the
defendant had intercourse at home with his 16 year old stepdaughter.
According to her testimony, she has has intercourse with the defendant
on a number of prior occasions but had never participated willingly or
consented.  The defendant was prosecuted for rape,  for ""open and gross
lewdness and lascivious behavior"" under S 16 and for being a ""lewd,
wanton and lascivious person in speech or behavior"" under S 53.  He was
acquitted of rape, but convicted under SS 16 and 53.  On appeal, the
defendant argued that he was convicted on duplicitous indictments and
that the charge under S 16 should therefore be dismissed.  He also urged
that the S 53 charge should be dismissed as unconstitutionally vague.
The SJC held that, although S 53 can apply to sexual conduct, ""...if
sexual acts for hire are not involved, there must be conduct that is
'public'..."" 381 N.E.2d at 1303.  Consequently, it reversed the
conviction under S 53.  However, it affirmed the conviction under S 16
saying: ""No argument is made that there was any error in the conviction
of 'open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior' under G.L.c.272, S
16, except for the claim that the two indictments were duplicitous.  The
history of S 16 is quite separate from that of S 53, and our cases give
adequate warning that S 16 could be applied to conduct like that of the
defendant."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  The court then cited *Commonwealth v.
Lucas*, 126 N.E.2d 804 (Mass. 1955), in which a defendant was convicted
of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior for committing a
sexual act in private with his daughter, less than 14 years of age, and
*Commonwealth v. Wardell*, 128 Mass. 52 (1880), in which a defendant was
convicted of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior for
exhibiting his ""private parts"" in a private house, not his own, in the
presence of an 11 year old girl and a child of 4.  After citing *Lucas*
and *Wardell*, the court in *Templeman* went on to say: ""Contrast
*Commonwealth v. Catlin*, 1 Mass. 8, 9-10 (consensual conduct of adults
in private)."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  In *Catlin*, the appellate court
reversed the conviction of a married man for open and gross lewdness and
lascivious behavior for lying in bed in private with a woman who was not
his wife on the ground that ""...*secret and private lewdness* and
lascivious behavior...cannot in any degree support the charge in the
indictment."" (Emphasis in original; 1 Mass. at 10.)
The question that concerns us is whether the affirmance of the
defendant's conviction under S 16 in *Templeman* is a holding or even an
indication that the prohibition in that section against ""open and gross
lewdness and lascivious behavior"" covers consensual acts between adults
in private.  The following factors in the case suggest that S 16 might
be construed to cover such acts: First, the court's decision dismissing
the conviction under S 53 was a square holding that the incident
occurred in private.  Second, the acquittal on the rape charge shows
that the jury found that the victim consented in fact.  Third, the
victim was 16 years old and, accordingly, capable of effectively
consenting to ""normal"" sexual intercourse, which is all that seems to
have occurred in this case.  (See G.L.c.265, S 23, and discussion below
regarding the question of consent.)  Other factors, however, indicate
that the affirmance of the conviction under S 16 does not mean that
consensual acts between adults in private are within the reach of that
section: First, the primary ground for the affirmance of the S 16
conviction was that""...no argument is made that there was any error in
the conviction...except for the claim that the two indictments were
duplicitous..."" 381 N.E.2d at 1304.  Second, after citing *Lucas* and
*Wardell*, in which the victims were under the age of 14 and, in once
[sic] case, the defendant's daughter, the court ""contrasted"" the
*Catlin* case, stating that it involved ""consensual conduct of adults in
private.""
The opinion in *Templeman* is rather muddled.  A reasonable explanation
of it seems to be that the court, without expressly saying so, was moved
by the relationship between the actor (father) and the victim (16 year
old stepdaughter) (See Model Penal Code, S 213.3(1)(b)), and that the
decision, insofar as it may hold that S 16 can apply to sexual acts in
private where there has been consent in fact, does not go beyond the
particular facts of the case, namely, a situation where the victim is
young and where, in the words of the Model Penal Code, the actor ""...is
his guardian or otherwise responsible for general supervision of his
welfare...""  So viewed, the holding in *Templeman* in affirming the S 16
conviction is simply that, in view of the ages and relationship of the
parties, consent in fact did not constitute effective consent as a
matter of law.  The court's failure to base its decision expressly on
this ground is easily understood; for, had it done so, the defendant
could have raised the constitutional question that the broad language of
S 16 had not been defined specifically to apply to the conduct
complained of.  In accord in limiting the reach of S 53 to conduct
committed in a public place is *Commonwealth v. Sefranka*, 414 N.E.2d
602 (Mass. 1980).
(3) The case under G.L.c.272, S 34.
Section 34 has been construed to forbid anal intercourse and bestiality.
*Commonwealth v. Gallant*, 369 N.E.2d 707, 714 (mass. 1977).  It seems
on its face to apply broadly to all acts of anal intercourse, both
public and private.  However, the SJC seems to have declared
unequivocally that adult consent is a defense to a prosecution for
sodomy in private.  *Commonwealth v.Manning*, 328 N.E.2d 496 (Mass.
1975).  In *Manning*, the defendant was convicted of rape, sodomy,
unnatural and lascivious acts, and assault and battery.  Although the
opinion of the SJC does not cite the particular sections of the law
under which the defendant was convicted, it states that he was sentenced
to a term of 5 to 7 years on the conviction for sodomy.  This means that
the sodomy conviction must have been under G.L.c.272, S 34, because SS
16, 35, and 53, the only other sections that might cover sodomy, provide
for shorter maximum terms of imprisonment.
In the appeals court in *Manning*, the defendant urged that the trial
court had erroneously excluded evidence of the complainant's poor
reputation for chastity.  The appeals court reversed the conviction for
rape on the ground that the defendant's reputation for chastity was
relevant to the question of her consent, but it upheld the convictions
for sodomy and unnatural acts on the ground that the excluded testimony
bore only on the question of consent, not veracity.  The SJC reversed
the convictions for sodomy and unnatural acts on the ground that if the
evidence of complainant's poor reputation for chastity had persuaded the
jury that rape did not take place and that the complainant had testified
falsely as to that, the jury might well have disbelieved the complainant
in her further uncorroborated testimony that sodomy and unnatural acts
had occurred.  The Court concluded as follows (328 N.E.2d at 501):
	Disposing of the case as we do, we need not go into any
	phase of the defendant's second contention, that, since
	our recent decision in Commonwealth v. Balthazar,
	318 N.E.2d 478 (1974), interpreted the unnatural acts
	statute to admit adult consent as a defense, reversal
	of his conviction is now required because the excluded
	evidence of the complainant's poor reputation for
	chastity was directly relevant in refuting the charges
	of sodomy and unnatural acts.  *While the consent 
	defense will be open to the defendant on a retrial*, we
	do not now undertake to decide whether a poor reputation
	for chastity, as distinguished from a reputation
	for engaging in the particular acts charged, is
	admissible to show consent as a defense to a charge
	of sodomy or unnatural acts. [Emphasis supplied]
C. Conclusion
It has been squarely held that the prohibition in G.L.c.272, S 35,
against ""unnatural and lascivious acts"" and the penalties imposed by S
35 upon ""lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior"" do
not apply where the acts in question are consensual and in private.  The
exclusion of private consensual acts from the reach of S 16 (""open and
gross lewdness and lascivious behavior"") and of S 34 (sodomy) is not
quite so certain but seems highly probable.  On balance, it seems safe
to say that sexual acts between consenting adults in private have been
decriminalized in Massachusetts.

Massachusetts
(Part II)
II. Consent
    A. The Age Below Which Actual Consent Does Not Constitute Effective
Consent.  The statutes are inconsistent.  GLc.265. S 23 provides:
Rape of Child.  Whoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural
sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen years of age shall,
for the first offense, be punished by imprisonment in the state prison
for life or for any term of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for
any term in a jail or house of correction, and for the second or
subsequent offense by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for
any term of years, but not less than five years.
GLc.272, S 35A provides:
Unnatural, etc., Acts with Child Under Sixteen.  Whoever commits any
unnatural and lascivious act with a child under the age of sixteen shall
be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more
than five years or in jail or the house of correction for not more than
two and one half years, and whoever over the age of eighteen commits a
second or subsequent offence [sic] shall be sentenced to imprisonment in
the state prison for a term of not less than five years.
GLc.272, S 4 provides:
Enticing to Unlawful Intercourse.  Whoever induces any person under
eighteen of chaste life to have unlawful sexual intercourse shall be
punished as provided in the preceding section.  [I.e., imprisonment for
not more than three years or fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, or
both.]
The general provisions of law defining ""minority"" and ""majority"" provide
that a person under 18 is a minor and becomes an adult at 18 (GLc.4, S
7, defs. 48-51).  Relying on these general provisions and apparently on
the Supreme Judicial Court's (SJC) use of the word ""adults"" in *C. v.
Balthazar*, the court in *C. v. Fleurant*, 372 N.E.2d 542 (Mass.App.
1978), held that ""minors,"" i.e., persons under 18, are presumed to be
incapable of giving consent to unnatural and lascivious acts and that,
therefor, where all the victims of the various offenses for which the
defendant was convicted were under 18, it was not necessary to reach the
question whether the acts were committed in private.  As the prosecution
was under GLc.272, S 35A (the only penal statute cited in the opinion),
it is strange that the court held 18 to be the ""age of consent"" because
S 35A only prohibits the proscribed conduct with person under 16.  The
court did not mention S 4, which prohibits inducing persons under 18 to
have unlawful sexual intercourse.  But in a prosecution under that
section it would have to be proved that the victims were ""of chaste
life,"" an unlikely situation these days.
In *C. v. Zeitler*, 389 N.E.2d 423 (Mass.App. 1979), a prosecution under
GLc.272. S 35, the court was faced with the question whether a person 16
or 17 years old can consent to an ""unnatural act.""  The court declared
(at 427-28):
	It is clear that a person under the age of sixteen
	cannot give such consent (GLc. 272. S 35A) and that a
	person who has attained the age of eighteen can.
	GLc.4, S 7, forty-ninth... Despite our holding in
	*C. v. Fleurant*... a majority of the panel are of the
	belief that there is a serious question as to
	whether it is the law that a person between sixteen
	and eighteen who can consent to any of the panoply of
	acts which constitute sexual intercourse...can also 
	consent to those acts which have been or may be
	classified as 'unnatural and lascivious' under
	GLc.272. SS 35 and 35A...""
The court certified this question to the SJC prior to a retrial of the
case.  The defendant's prosecution under S 35 was thereafter dropped,
the case motted, and the question left unanswered.
    B. Other Circumstances Under Which Actual Consent Does Not
Constitute Effective Consent.
       1. Persons Under the Influence of Drugs.  It seems reasonably
certain that the actual consent of a person under the influence of drugs
or intoxicants administered by the actor would not constitute effective
consent, pursuant to GLc. 272, S 3 (which includes a penalty of
imprisonment for no more than three years in the state prison or two and
one half years in the house of correction, or fine of not more than one
thousand dollars, or by both).
       2. Persons Under the Control of [sic--or] Domination of Others.
No statute or cases have been found dealing explicitly with whether the
actual consent to a sexual act of a victim who is under the control or
domination of the actor (e.g., prisoner and guard) constitutes effective
consent.  However, the decision in *C. v. Templeman, supra*, seems best
explained as a holding, not expressly articulated, that the actual
consent of the defendant's 16 year old step-daughter to sexual
intercourse with him was not effective consent because of his dominant
position with respect to her. (see Part I. Section B. para. 2. above)
In what other areas the courts may hold that actual consents are
ineffective where the consenting victim is under the domination of the
actor is a matter of speculation.
    C. Consent Under the Assault Statutes.
It is clear that the  terms ""unnatural sexual intercourse,"" ""unnatural
and lascivious acts"" and ""unlawful sexual intercourse"" as used in
GLc.265. S 23 and in c.272, SS 35A and 4, include sodomy, fellatio,
cunnilingus, mouth to anal contact and ""other intrusions [other than
""normal"" vaginal intercourse] of a part of a person's body or other
object into the genital or anal opening of another person's body."" (See:
*C. v. Gallant*. 369 N.E.2d 707. 712. 714 (Mass. 1977); *C. v. Manning*,
328 N.E.2d 496, 497, 499 (Mass. 1975); *C. v. Deschamps*, 294 N.E.2d 426
(Mass. 1972); *C. v. LaBella*, 306 N.E.2d 813 (mass. 1974); *C. v.
Balthazar*, 318 N.E.2d 478, 482 (Mass. 1974); *C. v. LaMay*, 369 N.E.2d
1036 (Mass.App. 1977).)  Whether those terms as used in those statutes
include other acts deliberately committed for sexual gratification, such
as the touching of genital areas (hereinafter called ""sexual contacts""),
is not clear.  The court in *C. v. Zeitler* stated (389 N.E.2d at 427)
that only the acts listed above fall within the terms ""unnatural and
lascivious"" acts.  It is uncertain whether the same result would be
reached in a case of sexual contacts between persons of the same sex.
Whether such sexual contacts fall within the scope of GLc. 265, S 23 or
c.272. SS 35, 35A, or 4, it appears that one who commits a sexual
contact upon another in the absence of effective consent is guilty of
assault and battery under c.265. SS 13A (Assault and Assault and
Battery), 13B (Indecent Assault and Battery on Child Under Fourteen),
13F (Indecent Assault and Battery on Mentally Retarded Person) or 13H
(Indecent Assault and Battery on Person Aged Fourteen or Older).  These
crimes are variously punishable by imprisonment for periods of two and a
half to five years, or, in the case of S 13A, by a fine of not more than
$500.
In *C. v. Burke*, (Mass., 11/22/83, not yet reported), the defendant was
prosecuted under S 13B and found guilty of assault and battery upon a
female child under age 14.  The District Court, faced with what it
considered the novel issue of whether evidence of the child's consent
should be admitted as material upon retrial, reported this question to
the SJC, among others: ""Is lack of consent an element of the offense of
indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years
proscribed by...S 13B..?""  In responding, the SJC summarized the law as
follows:  (1) A physically harmful or potentially harmful touching is
always a battery, and consent is immaterial;  (2) A non-harmful touching
is a battery only if there was no consent;  (3) In a prosecution for
assault and battery for a non-harmful touching, the Commonwealth bears
the burden of proving absence of consent;  (4) S 13B does not establish
age 14 as the ""age of consent"" below which actual consent is immaterial
because ineffective, but merely provides a penalty for the nonconsensual
touching of a person under 14 more severe than that provided for the
nonconsensual touching of a person 14 or over;  (5) The capacity of the
alleged victim to consent is a question of fact to be determined by the
trier of fact.  In making such a determination, the age of the child is
crucial, but other factors, such as intelligence, maturity and
experience may be considered.
Assuming that these principles would apply in a prosecution under S 13F
for indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person, a nice
question remains:  Would proof of mental retardation in any degree be
sufficient, *ipso facto*, to establish the alleged victim's incapacity
to consent effectively, or would it remain for the trier of fact to
weigh the degree of mental retardation along with other relevant factors
in determining the question whether actual consent was effective?
*Burke* suggests that the alleged victim's capacity to consent
effectively should be determined by the trier of fact on the basis of
all relevant factors.
The rule stated in *Burke* is well illustrated in *C. v. Appleby*, 402
N.E.2d 1051 (Mass. 1980), in which it was held that actual consent of a
sexual partner to an act of violence in an S&M relationship does not
protect the actor from liability for assault and battery.  In *Appleby*,
the defendant, one of two male sexual partners, hit his partner with a
riding crop and, upon complaint of the victim, was prosecuted for
assault and battery.  The defense was that the act was a sexual act in
private to which the victim had consented and was therefore lawful under
*Balthazar*.  In affirming the conviction, the SJC held (402 N.E.2d at
1060-61): ""The fact that violence may be related to sexual activity (or
may even be sexual activity to the person inflicting pain on another as
[the defendant] testified) does not prevent the State from protecting
its citizens against physical harm.  The invalidity of the victim's
consent to a battery by means of a dangerous weapon would be the same,
however, whether or not the battery wa related to sexual activity.""
III. Privacy
No statute has been found defining what is public and private, but the
cases are illuminating.  The SJC stated the rule in general terms as
follows:
	The rationale of GLc.272. S 35 is to prevent the
	open flouting of community standards regarding sexual
	matters...  The statutory object is to prevent the
	possibility that the defendant's conduct might give
	offense to persons present in a place frequented by
	members of the public for reasons of business,
	entertainment or the like...  However, the statute is
	not designed to punish persons who desire privacy
	and who take reasonable measures to secure it...  The
	essential query is whether the defendant intended
	public exposure or recklessly disregarded a
	substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons...
	Conduct is not established as public merely because
	another person observes the conduct...  The
	Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being
	observed by casual passersby must have been
	reasonably forseeable by the defendant, or stated
	otherwise, that the defendant acted upon an
	unreasonable expectation that his conduct would
	remain secret.  [*C. v. Ferguson*, N.E.2d 1365, 1367
	(Mass. 1981)]
In *Ferguson*, the defendant on a very cold night picked up a woman in
his car and drove to the rear of a dark, public parking lot where the
woman performed consensual fellatio upon him.  Police who observed the
pick-up followed the defendant into the parking lot, shone a flashlight
into the car, and arrested both persons.  The defendant was convicted
under S 35 or committing an unnatural and lascivious act.  After
reviewing in detail the evidence bearing on the question whether the
defendant should reasonably have forseen that the conduct might be
observed by casual passersby, the SJC concluded that the prosecution had
failed to prove its case and gave judgement for the defendant.  Three
justices dissented.  They agreed that ""it is incumbent upon the
Commonwealth to prove that the act occurred in a public place,"" but
suggested ""that there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in a
case like this where an automobile maneuvers in an urban area,"" and
added ""that the defendants similarly situated in future cases, may not
take much comfort from the instant case, since it seems clear...that the
majority opinion is suggesting that  the Commonwealth could have made
its case with a few easily provable, added facts."" 422 N.E.2d at 1369.
In *C. v. Scagliotti*, 371 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. 1977), the defendant was
convicted of the common law crime of soliciting a person to commit a
felony, namely, an unnatural and lascivious act with another person
under S 35.  The events took place in a ""mini-movie"" theater that
exhibits sexually explicit films in small cubicles.  The defendant
entered a cubicle where a detective was standing and offered to perform
an ""unnaturla act.""  The cubicle accommodated two persons, and when its
door was closed a red light warned other persons not to enter.  In
reversing the conviction and remanding the case for a new trial, the SJC
held that the trial judge had erred in instructing the jury that the
cubicle was a public place as a matter of law, and declared:
	A consensual unnatural act must be committed in a
	public place in order to be punishable under...S 35...
	The public nature of the consensual act is an
	essential element to be proved by the prosecution...
	[The] testimony [on the issues of whether the cubicle
	in fact afforded privacy] was susceptible to
	conflicting interpretations, and where inferences
	might be drawn from the testimony upon a certain
	point, the question must be submitted to the jury...
371 N.E.2d at 727.
IV. Solicitation
The defendant in *C. v. Scagliotti* was convicted of soliciting another
to commit an unnatural and lascivious act under S 35.  The SJC stated
the issue before it to be simply ""whether the defendant had offered to
commit the act in a public place,"" and it held that if a jury found that
the defendant's offer was to commit the act in a private place, the
defendant could not be convicted.
In *C. v. Sefranka*, 414 N.E.2d 602 (Mass. 1980), the defendant was
convicted of being a ""lewd, wanton and lascivious person in speech or
behavior"" in violation of c.272. S 53.  The undisputed facts were that
the defendant, who had parked his car in a rest area of a public road,
approached a plainclothes detective in an unmarked car in the rest area,
and invited the officer to return with him to his house for oral
copulation.  The officer refused to leave the rest area indicating that
he wanted the sexual activity to take place there.  The defendant said
it was not safe at the rest area and drove away, and was arrested soon
after.  The SJC reversed the conviction on the ground that the ""lewd,
wanton and lascivious persons"" provision ""was unconstitutionally vague
as construed by our past decision in effect at the time of the
defendant's conviction.""  It construed the provision ""to prohibit only
the commission of conduct in a public place, or the public solicitation
of conduct to be performed in a public place, when the conduct committed
or solicited involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks or female
breasts, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense, by a
person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons
who may be offended by the conduct."" 414 N.E.2d at 608.
It should be noted, however, that the provision of S 53 prohibiting
""common night walkers, both male and female"" was held to cover the
solicitation of one who is abroad at night of people to have ""illicit
sexual intercourse"" without in any way excluding the solicitation of
acts to be conducted in private in the earlier case of *Thomas v. C.*,
243 N.E.2d 821 (Mass. 1969).  Such pertinent facts as whether Thomas was
convicted on the basis of one, a few or many solicitations, and whether
the acts solicited were to be performed in private, do not appear from
the opinion.  Since the decision in *Balthazar*, it seems unlikely that
one could be convicted as a common nightwalker for one public
solicitation for the commission of a sexual act in private where no
compensation is to be paid by one party to the other (see section on
prostitution, below).
Also notable is *Riegle v. Terrazzi*, 417 N.E.2d 1227 (Mass.App. 1981),
in which a reporter for Gay Community News (Boston) sought a preliminary
injunction against a police campaign to suppress sexual activity in the
men's room of the Boston Public Library.  The reporter alleged that the
police had engaged in provocative sexual activity to entrap people, and
that when plaintiff stood outside the men's room to get information for
a news story, the police had ordered him away on threat of arrest.  The
Appeal Court affirmed the denial of injunctive relief, stating that the
record furnished no basis for finding abuse of discretion by the police.
The court stated, however, that upon a more complete record ""there later
may be presented questions concerning a proper balance between  (a)
protecting the access of Gay Community News to information of obvious
interest to its readers, and  (b) proper police operations to suppress
what may be either criminal activity (GLc.272, S 16) or an ongoing
nuisance.""  The court indicated that an adequate presentation of
evidence ought to include ""(a) the extent of any nuisance created by
users of, or by misconduct in, the men's room of the Library;  (b) any
specific misconduct, such as entrapment or provocation, or other
inappropriate behavior, by the police...;  (c) whether... reporters
could proceed with their operations without obstruction or embarrassment
of proper police operations;...  (d) any unreasonable harm to Riegle or
his employer."" 417 N.E.2d at 1229.
V. Prostitution
The only statute that deals with prostitution is the provision of
GLc.272, S 53 penalizing ""common night walkers,"" prostitutes, etc.  In
*C. v. King*, 272 N.E.2d 196 (Mass. 1977), female prostitutes convicted
under this section appealed alleging the statute unconstitutionally
discriminated against women because female prostitutes were prosecuted
while male prostitutes and male customers of prostitutes were not.  The
SJC affirmed the conviction on the ground that S 53 applies to male
prostitutes as well as female prostitutes and that there was no evidence
in the record of discriminatory enforcement.  It concluded that the law
did not punish persons who hire or seek to hire another to engage in
sexual activity but held that this did not violate the defendants'
constitutional right to equal protection because ""S 53 was designed to
attack merely one phase of the problem,"" and ""the legislature may select
one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting others."" 372
N.E.2d at 203-04.
VI. Penalties.  Penalties under those statutes which remain enforceable
are as discussed in connection with each statute.
[NOTE: Gay Community News reporter Larry Goldsmith informs me that since
this document was originally written, the SJC wrote an opinion upholding
c.272, S 14 (adultery): *C. v. Judith Stowell*.  The SJC also apparently
ruled in favor of Burke in *C. v. Burke* (indecent assault and battery
on child under 14-- G.L.c.265, S 13B).]","gjQBLRNpPuAJ",11,1984-11-13,-102,14

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

not he *really* likes spending lots of time in bed with other guys.
We are talking about hard-core gay MEN.  And hard-core bisexuals.
And hard-core lesbians.
Just who do you think you are talking to Mr. Brunson?
	Does GOD read USENET?
You are wasting your time here.  There are very few sexual sinners out
there that are marginally committed.  Unless you consider a little oral
sex from another guy occasionally (you know, when you're hard up) . . .
(And so drunk that to call it a memory would really be a cause for concern.)
People, gay people even, don't go around saying:  ""Geez, you know, life
might be a lot easier for me if I just gave up this whole gay thing.""
WELL, maybe if ALL your friends said you were BiB (Boring in Bed) you
might wanna see if women found your assets more pleasing.  But, NOBODY
thinks that discrimination in any way has prevented homosexuality from
becoming the grand old pastime that it is.  And why?  I'll tell you.
You see, they've done these studies that showed that the incidence of
homosexuality is roughly a constant 10% -- in any old cultures you
happen to choose.  Yes, you heard me.  And some of those cultures are
probably more intolerant than the one we live in, and some are probably
pretty good places for gay people like us to hang out (but those cultures
probably don't have compact disc players so I'll stay right here thank you).
SO, your being mean to those ""sexual sinners"" isn't likely to have much
effect on what people choose to do in bed, or even how often they choose
to do it.  BUT, it will have an effect, yes sirree!  (Don't doubt that.)
The effect will be thus:  Your son would never share his gayness with you.
Not only that, lots of other sons (and daughters!) would never tell the
parents they loved for so long about this thing which they feel would drive
apart their cherished family unit.  Got That?  So you wanna know how you
can tell if your beloved johnny is gay.  See how much he talks to you,
Mr. Brunson.  Does he often stay out late saying that he was spending time
""with friends.""  Would you rather believe that than the truth that dare not
enter your mind?  (An aside to believers: Let alone speak its name.)
The point is this, Mr. Brunson.  You can't get rid of homosexulity.  Believe
me, I've tried.  But, you can drive it underground and into the bushes.  You
might find that more appealing to your well-defined moral sense.  You know,
Out of My Sight, Out of My Mind.  (""I don't see anyone starving in America!"")
What do you want, Mr. Brunson?  An America were homosexuals are free to meet
in classy, chic restaurants   or   an America where you have no idea of what
someone does for a living until after the fact.  You decide.
By the way, Book Burning is never a good idea.  I can't think of any ideas
(not even Book Burning, *surprise*!) which I wouldn't want my kids exposed
to.  Unless of course my kids were stupid and believed every damn piece of
parchment they laid their eyes on.  But then, that would be their problem,
right?
You think things out so well, but you miss the big picture.  The exact same
books you use to claim that being gay is a ""sexual sin.""  Say that
	Thou shalt not spill his seed upon the ground.
	(or stain the sheets!)
Now tell me, Mr. Brunson, do  YOU  think masturbation is a sin?
Do YOU ask for    the forgiveness of GOD    every time YOU have a little
party with your right hand?
I think your answer to this would settle the whole issue once and for all.
Anyone, and I mean even you, who thinks that masturbation is a sin is,
pardon the term, a certified quack.  Even Dear Abby says it O.K. for the
guys to play with their peters.  On the other hand (!), if you think . . .
(dare I say it) ONANISM is a fine and dandy pursuit THEN how do you square
this with your firmly held convictions regarding what is and what isn't a
""sexual sin.""  I mean, who makes up these rules anyway, masturbaters?
Yes, what DO you do about those hard-core Jerk-Offs.  You know, the ones
that ask you for money in skid row.  If you give them a fin they're just
gonna pop into the nearest peep show and get they're rocks off.  You're
better of giving them a Nature's Valley Granola Bar.
	    If the sinner,
	    the enemy of righteousness,
	    the liar against the truth,
	    the defiler of those things that are holy and good,
	    needs food, then feed him.
I don't know about you but the only thing I defile that's ""holy and good""
is this pair of briefs that I stole from my first in college.
Actually, you've completely lost all your credibility in this group already.
What I'm telling you is that the onanism point is moot, don't waste your time
on it.  Your faux pas came when you so thoughtlessly recommended that
    all of the French existentialist literature
be destroyed in a pyromaniacal Book-Burning orgy.  You brute, you.
	    On the other hand sexual sins: fornication,
	    homosexuality, incest, adultery, bestiality,
	    are always, under all circumstances, inherently evil.
WHAT!  FORNICATION, inherently evil!  This I've gotta see!  I mean, like,
where would you and your kids (not to mention your wife) be without . . .
you know, the thing you close the door for.  I mean, what the hell, if
fornication is just as bad as homosexuality I might as well give this gay
thing a whirl.  I mean, fornication usually gets a pretty high rating from most
people, right up there with watching DYNASTY (a bad combination by the way).
	    Once again, can anyone give me any kind of reason
	    (even a ""logical"" one) why I should be treated as
	    a criminal for refusing to associate with homosexuals?
Aw, come on now, Mr. Brunson.  Don't be such a party pooper, associate with
us.  What are you afraid of, disease?  How old are you anyway?  You don't
come here that often do you?  I promise to be gentle.  You know what, I
think you're the type that would really go for this.  (Are you a talker?)
You know, I think we could have a lot of fun together if only you'd loosen
up a little.  Don't be such a tightass!  Relax -- you'll get your turn.
Here, smell this.  It's only poppers.  That's right.
Hey, Mr. Brunson, I really apologize for playing with you like this, but
you gotta admit, You Asked For It.  You really did.  So I just gave it to
you.  What are ya gonna do now, run home and complain to mommy?  You'll
be lucky enough to find a chair you can sit on.  No hard feelings I hope.

Well, well, the truth comes out at last.  Arndt's spine is even
limper than the wrists of the ""fruits"" he fantasizes about.  (I
dismissed ""moral fiber of a jellyfish"" as a bit too hackneyed.)
He's the guy in the western who comes running up all a-tremble,
stutters ""Look out, kid--the posse's comin'!"", and slinks off
to avoid the shootin'.  But guess what, Ken?  They already knew
about it, and worse than you'll ever know, so pardon them (and me)

Complaints about Ken Arndt in net.motss tend to take one (or all) of
three directions: he's not supportive, he's unintelligible, or he's
rude.  In response to the complaint that he's rude and unsupportive,
some have argued that he appears to be knowledgable and perhaps, at
times, even reasonable. In response to such responses, others have
denied the possibility that he may be reasonable, argued that his
rudeness is the main point to be considered, and/or suggested that he
attempt to become intelligible that his points, if there be any besides
a hypothetical one atop his head, be better understood.
Let me reject the ""not supportive"" complaint out of hand; why someone
must be supportive to be heard escapes my understanding. (After all,
I tolerate liberals in net.politics -- though it appears some have
great difficulty tolerating me.) And I think that most net.motss
readers, gay and otherwise, agree. (Let me also reject the complaint
not noted above, that he has no answers to the problems he raises.
Who does?) Leaving, of the three types of complaints I noted, that he
is frequently unintelligible and rude.
On to intelligibility. I frequently find such luminaries as Sartre,
Connell, Eliot, Hamsun, Lagerkvist, Pynchon, Brecht, Ionesco, and
Baudelaire... unintelligible. On the other hand, I sometimes find
them intelligible, which sustains me in reading their works. And I
have found that it is generally true that just that which makes them
so often unintelligible makes their message, when I am hit with it,
so forceful. Now, one need not include Ken in the list above -- i.e.,
as of the same rank -- to consider the possibility that his style suits
him as the best to get across his points. To make a point, it may
sometimes be necessary to strike the listener in the face with a dead
fish. Would you reduce the efforts of, say, Ionesco to that which would
fit on a bumper sticker? (It would save a lot of trees; ""The Lesson""
could be reduced to ""Communication is Fraught with Difficulty,"" and
certainly everyone would understand that communication.) Would
you wait till the author died, and read the books of criticism about
the author's work? It's usually easier than reading the work itself.
Would you have the author write an essay as dull as this one (albeit
in better prose, no doubt)? Or would you admit the possibility that the
author embedded his meaning as much in the form of his work as in the
words? That in order to understand it, you had to do more than
intellectualize? (I remember, from Personality Theory or Abnormal
Psychology, when the professor explained ""intellectualization"" as
the defense mechanism which enabled 150 male students to hear him say
something like ""All males hate their fathers because they secretly want
to have sexual intercourse with their mothers,"" busily write it down,
and wait for the next point. Having missed the last one.)
Not that I think I've convinced anyone of anything, but let's get on
to rudeness. Really not getting on at all, since the same point
raised above -- that attention may be better commanded by striking
the listener in the face with a dead fish than by writing a deadly
boring essay such as I am now doing -- applies here. Maybe you
should regard Arndt as an onion in the stew of life, and not expect
your reasoned arguments to turn him into a carrot.
The suggestion has been tendered that someone, not Ken, who reads
an Arndt message and espies some redeeming quality there, translate
the message for the edification of the remainder of the crew. A bad
idea, I think, but since I am filled (indeed, brimming over) with
polite language (rather gray, but it doesn't disturb anyone as long
as I don't mention National Review), let me try an example. Ken
recently wrote in an article that when in boot camp he felt sorry
for a crying recruit who was kicked by every other recruit who passed
him, including, when Ken got to him, Ken. Some net.motss readers
read this as a brave ""coming out of the closet"" on Ken's part,
others as an expression of Ken's wimpiness/rudeness/brutality.
Enter Mr. Explain-it-in-all-gray-tones! Ahem. ""In the message from
Ken, which you are not reading because its style, nay, its very
language, was deemed inappropriate, Ken related an anecdote, or
perhaps a parable, to the effect that today's polite sympathy may not
translate into polite actions on the morrow."" Really grabbed you, eh?
Thought so.
(You know, as I was mentally composing this essay, I kept hearing
Muzak playing when I thought of the brave new world we all expect
when everyone talks and writes ever so politely, and reasonably,
like, say, me. I couldn't figure out why the damned Muzak was
playing for a couple of hours, when I suddenly was hit by the
shopping market scene at the end of ""Stepford Wives."" I'd explain
the scene in words, but I'm afraid I'd gray so far as to disappear.)
Listen, I suspect two things: That Ken is damned nigh well unique
(certainly on this net), and that the kind of person many net.motss
readers think he is, is not. It's the latter you've got to look
out for and try to sway. Run off to mod.motss if you will, where
the moderator will protect you from immoderate opinions -- but
if everything turns to shit, and the world comes tumbling down
on your head, please refrain from asking ""But they all seemed so
nice! What happened?""
I can sense that some of you (most of you?) are still unconvinced.
Very well, in better polite language than my own...
     ""Perhaps there is really no such thing as a Revolution
     recorded in history. What happened was always a Counter-
     Revolution. Men were always rebelling against the last
     rebels; or even repenting of the last rebellion. This
     could be seen in the most casual contemporary fashions,
     if the fashionable mind had not fallen into the habit of
     seeing the very latest rebel as rebelling against all
     ages at once. The Modern Girl [this written in 1933]
     with the lipstick and the cocktail is as much a rebel
     against the Women's Rights Woman of the '80's, with her
     stiff stick-up collars and strict teetotalism, as the
     latter was a rebel against the Early Victorian lady of the
     languid waltz tunes and the album full of quotations from
     Byron; or as the last, again, was a rebel against a
     Puritan mother to whom the waltz was a wild orgy and
     Byron the Bolshevist of his age. Trace even the Puritan
     mother back through history and she represents a rebellion
     against the Cavalier laxity of the English Church, which
     was at first a rebel against the Catholic civilisation,
     which had been a rebel against the Pagan civilisation.
     Nobody but a lunatic could pretend that these things
     were a progress; for they obviously go first one way and
     then the other.""
[From G.K. Chesterton's ""Saint Thomas Aquinas,"" Image Books, Garden
City, New York, pp. 76-77, 1956. Which is, of course, irrelevant
because it was written by (a) a conservative who (b) is dealing with
a religious topic.]
Of course, Ken may be simply as you see him: a rude and unintelligible
boor. Yes, Ken could be exactly what many of you think he is, a bad
boy so typical of the religious right. So typical.
Keep your eyes on him.

""unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", ""rude""?  Do you actually read
either Arndt's or anyone else's postings in net.motss?  (I'm get-
ting tired of asking this rather rhetorical question, but the
myopia on this net is just unbelievable!)
SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson 
are that they're bigoted, insulting, exhibitionistic in really loathsome
ways (like, for example, street psychotics), filled with hatred and
self-hatred, etc. etc.  And this adds up to merely ""rude""?  Is it
merely ""rude"" to call a group of blacks ""filthy niggers"" who ought
to be ""hung from the nearest available tree"" AND then launch into,
say, ""rational"" discussion of race relations and the legislative
agenda before Congress?  And then swerve into a polemic denouncing
funding for sickle cell anemia (""Let 'em die!  We'll finally have
social peace!""), and discourse repetitively & at great length about
the genetic disposition of black men to commit rape (of white women,
that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt
Phenomenon is that bigoted and deliberately offensive postings 
are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this
option at all.

apologists for Arndt's behavior.  We are discussing, not ""supportiveness""
(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability to
treat a discussion and its members seriously.  Right now, there is
only one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.
Let's get one thing clear here.  If he acted this way in any other
newsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank.  If he behaved in
public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

It looks for all the world like HLTVIII is the bug responsible for AIDS.
Its origins may be Nigeria (though the Kaposi's sarcoma stuff looks
similar, it's a symptom rather than a near relative) by way of the Carib.
Further, serum is the media that the little cyto-megalovirus lives in,'
but the transmission (read vector here) is *overwhelmingly* limited to
the seriously promiscous element of the gay community...with the exception
of those members of the popluation (usually hemophiliac) who cannot use
filtered blood, and those (usually bisexual) in direct contac with the
above mentioned.
What steps are being taken in the gay community to address the issue of
AIDS....control, spread, etc. I am personally inclined to view it in
much the same manner as any other venereally transmitted disease (save
for the obvious fact that gonorrhea isn't fatal, and doesn't have a similiar
etiology)...controlling the disease is a question of habit. To the extent
that the gay agenda for increased civil recognition *requires* a broad-based
coalition within the gay community, does the potential ""self-policing""
of the gay community represent a an internal threat to the coalition
necessary for gay rights?
If Phil Ngai and the spokesperson on NPR for the gay/lesbian coalition 
last night on the bathhouse closings are to be believed, the issue
*has* begun to move into the political and judicial spotlight. Must the
SF department of public health move to close the bathhouses because
the gay community has for some reason refused to close the places
themselves?

(Byron's reply)
Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny.  AIDS is serum-vectored
not 'homosexual vectored.' 
 
               ***(Ken now) 
             Wrong!!!  A vector is, ""an insect or other ORGANISM (italics
mine) transmitting germs or other agents of disease"" - Am Coll. Dict. 
The serum is merely the medium the virus is in, NOT the vector.  Or to put it
another way, the action (behavior) of the vector passes the virus, the serum is
neutral.  It is the behavior of the vector, in this case homosexuals which 
passes on the disease.  Such as anal intercourse, which often causes minute
tearing of the small blood vessels in the lower bowel and makes possible the
passing of the virus.  Also the passing of other serums (saliva, semen) 
transmits the virus.
************************
NOW HEAR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
************************
 
       I am NOT, that is NOT, saying that homosexuals are responsible for AIDS!
The virus is, of course!!  They are responsible (the promiscuous ones, remember
the same way promiscuous hetrosexuals are responsible for other sexually 
related diseases) for the TRANSMISSION of the disease virus!!!!!
If you, or anyone else, cares to remember I started this whole thing by saying
""smugly of course"" AIDS would be a hammar blow to drive the homosexuals back
into the closet and what are the gays doing about that.  The answer so soon
forthcoming, from Steve Dyer, et al, was ""EEk, get away from me, you rough
trade you.  How dare you even ASK such a question, etc., etc.""  They treated
me like a fart at a cheeze tasters ball.  I know, I know, I didn't say ""may
I"" and tell how much I think you all contribute to civilization and what
great guys and gals you all are otherwise.
 
I would have thought a reasonable response would have been, ""yes we have a
problem and here is what we are doing about it . . . ie. speaking out against
bath house sex as unhealthy if not psychologically, then from a physical
standpoint.  Remember gang, it's not just AIDS out there haunting the gay
community!  There are a raft of nasties of which the gay community is the
vector.
 
   (Byron answers previous posting)                                            
The first identifiable breakout just happens
to have been in the gay population.  It could have as easily been among
drug addicts, pro football players or army privates.  The first instances
of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century.  That
doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it.  Was the American
Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?
        *****(Ken replies now)
           Well, it actually started in Africa and the Carib. but yes in the
U.S.of A. it ""came out"" in the gay community.  Again, I agree with you that
the gays are not responsible for the virus!!!  But they ARE, that's ARE, 
responsible for continuing to be the vector once it became known HOW the
virus was passed!!  To take measures (filter blood supply, avoid contact, etc)
against the vector is a reasonable thing to do.  And homosexuals themselves
are taking steps to guard against getting the disease.
**************
Note:  No one is taking steps against the serum!!  Wiping out spit, semen, 
blood.  Isn't that because the serum is not the vector????  What IS being
done, or at least ought to be done, is to take steps against the vector.
Bath houses ARE being closed.  Often on the request of homosexual groups!

(old Ken)
>What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious
>problem to the entire population . . . "" mean??  The point of my postings
>was that very fact!!!
(old Byron)
It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place
blame.  That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it
certainly doesn't protect either of us.  Do you have anything constructive
to offer?  If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments.
       ****(new Ken now)
              You muddle-headed shit-head!  Promiscuous homosexuals ARE to
""blame"" for passing on the virus!!!  And now the more so since they KNOW
they are the vector.  But that is NOT the point of my postings.  You, and
your clones, -: appear to me to be like a little child caught at something
or other.  Trying to point to anything else but themselves. The point of all
my postings was, and is, to get responses from the gay community as to how
they plan to deal with the very real dangers that confront them.  Lucky for
you all gays are not like the few on this net who can't seem to deal with
me.  There isn't anyone who says that the homosexual community isn't the
vector for these diseases!!!!!  That's no news.  That's not the point of
any of my postings.
I see a tidal wave of events shaping up before the gay community that will
wipe them out!!!!  You mumble and press the ""n"" key.  Great!  Maybe the
Smithsonian will be able to preserve a few of you in pickle jars.
[By the way, I have been toying with a piece on the impact of ""modern"" ethics
as seen in statements by bioethicists on abortion, on the homosexual community.
That is, if gays are ever seen as a ""diseased"" danger, a quality of life issue,  
or a threat to the majority's value system if that value system doesn't include
any idea of the value of the individual. Do the new ""ethics"" set the stage
for sending the gays to the ""showers""?]        
(old Ken) 
>You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
>there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children

 (old Byron)
So what are YOU going to do about it?  If AIDS is in the general population
then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility.  What
are you trying to do?  From the tone and content of your postings all I
can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back!  The smugness
that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune.
I got news for you.  Viruses mutate.  It's what they do.  That's how
the disease got here in the first place according to some.  Should
this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble
and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us 
out of that trouble.
      ************(Ken now)
       I told YOU they mutate.  And yes some feel that's where this outbreak
came from.  It's only a half-brainer to figure out what we'll do if it gets
into the general public.  PANIC!!!!  And look for SCAPEGOATS!!  And isolate
them!!!  Guess who?  
It is partly because of my concern for myself that I have raised the issue
with you.  I am potentially at risk.  Because of YOU (or your promiscuous 
fellows).  
What am I doing???  Well, for starters I've given you all more information
than you've ever seen on this net. I've gone to the vector and asked for
a plan of action.  Some of you ARE in homosexual organizations.  It doesn't
appear that you know of any action to stop the disease.  Just treat it.
I'm asking you to take it back??  Cute but stupid.  Not to mention a lie.
Smug?!  Is that your best answer??  Sad.
 
What am I doing??? See below in the very next section.  Aren't I asking you
to take some action.  Tell me, to the best of your memory, has anyone on the
net said perhaps the gays should relook at their ""lifestyles"" even if only 
during the present health crisis?  Maybe one or two touched on it, but most
(like you) just stood on a chair and pulled up their skirts.

Isn't this all a little like locking the barn door after the horses have
escaped?  I went through the sexual revolution and never even caught cold.
My experience doesn't mean a d*mn thing either.  We agree that AIDS is
a tragedy, now WHAT ARE YOU AND I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
             ******(new Ken)
        Looking at it as locking the barn door is just plain stupid - and
dangerous for the gays.  Changing promiscuous behavior NOW could provent
a lot of cases of AIDS.
 
Yes, by all means, let's get together and come up with ""what you and I are
going to do about it.""

That's why I'm  bothering to reply to you.  Dumping the freaks before they
drag me down with them.  I got little use for someone who sits in corners
and rants and raves, gleefully pointing out victims with a singular lack
of compassion, but hasn't the desire to do something constructive.
            **********(new Ken)
         Come on Byron.  Sure I'm not Mr. Congeniality, but ""gleefully
pointing out victims""??  Piss off!  And just how compasionate is your
""dumping the freaks before they drag me down with them.""?

not a drinker (puking all over myself soon got boring), two or three glasses
of wine once in a while puts me away.  I also found out I was not a gambler,
but that's another story!
 
You don't seem to know any more about AIDS, etc. than you do about biblical
texts.  What are you doing in net.religion?  I know, you have a terminal.

Glad you said that my statement to the effect that Aids is ""homosexually
vectored"" is SOMEWHAT imprecise!  Because it's not imprecise by much if
at all.  ""Intermingling of blood"", yes but not from bumping into each other,
unless . . . (but I'm trying to change).  It's not the fact of transfusions
(the act) that causes Aids!  I get Aids from a carrier who donated blood.
The carriers are identified as . . . (fill in the blanks).  You seem to be
saying pouring blood causes Aids!  ""Aids is transmitted through the inter-
mingling of blood supply as might happen with transfusion.""
By the way, Aids is also transmitted through semen and some feel through
saliva.
What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious
problem to the entire population . . . "" mean??  The point of my postings
was that very fact!!!
Where do you read my ""smug assurance"" of my own safety??
I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children
with Aids.  About 70 so far, with hundreds more projected.  They highlighted
the problems of one little boy under sentence of death (are you SURE that
homosexuals are not responsible just a little - even those not promiscuous
but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
Hey, it's getting bigger by the minute.  You've got to do more than raise
funds, teach each other to check for sores first and man hotlines.  Hint:
You've got to speak to fellow gays about behavior patterns (which might
entail relooking at ""lifestyles"" ((baths, bars, etc.))).
How about looking at the ""sexual revolution""?  Remember the young Aids
victim I quoted as saying, ""We were told that sex was liberating and more
sex was more liberating.""
Rich Johnson I believe it was, whines about, ""what ever happened to 'do your
own thing?'""  It never was.  One person alone to the limits of nature but
not in a society.  That's the reason for government.  Laws.
Another, Gerber, asks ""am I my brother (homosexual's) keeper?""  What a waste-
land if the answer to that is no!!
As Aids and it's cost get bigger the public is going to look for SCAPEGOATS!
Guess who?  Think all those nice pols are going to help you then?
So rather than marching with Sister Boom Boom and the Children's Crusade
you should be marching the other way!  Dump the freaks before they drag -:
you down with them.  Of course by dump them I mean their positions.

approve of Mr. Ardnt.
From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct 10, 1984.
In a prepared statement on Tuesday, San Francisco public health director
Mervyn Silveman said ""These businesses (gay bathhouses) have been
inspected on a number of occasions and demonstrate a blatant disregard for
the health of their patrons and of the community.
	""Make no mistake about it. These 14 establishments are not
fostering gay liberation. They are fostering disease and death.""
	He then ordered the commercial sex establishments closed.
Silverman had threatened to close the bathhouses and other commercial
sex establishments last March, but instead ordered a ban on sex in such
establishments in the city. Silverman said his decision (to close the
bathhouses) was reached because ""we now have solid evidence that AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease - often spread by people who are unaware that
they are carrying the virus. The virus, he said, has been found in 40 to 50
percent of the gay male population in San Francisco.

Who does it hurt, Ken?  It doesn't hurt ME.  What laws?  (Or, to
rephrase that, what ENFORCED laws). Sexual acts between two consenting
adults are not exactly investigated by the police anymore.   
      Ken->    **No, no Andy, I only meant those to be examples of criteria,
                 I was not trying to say they are the ones to be chosen!  That
                 would be up to any homosexual who wished to answer me.  Either
                 I didn't make that clear or you misconceived (an oxymoron??)
                 my statement.  But since you ask . . .:
                    Doesn't hurt you, eh?  As long as you don't get AIDS (which
                    we all understand doesn't have ANYTHING to do with 
                    homosexual behavior and practice, or any other cute little
                    disease) or you are not phychologically damaged (as any
                    heterosexual - see Perlow?) by promiscuity.  And no need
                    for you hurt yourself by missing out on a family with 
                    children - you can always adopt (with a little change to 
                    the laws - like ERA).  And never to know that one woman
                    who above all others fills your life as a woman, to 
                    stand beside her as she gives birth to your child -
                    Doesn't hurt you?  YOU LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE!!
 
                    Some laws against homosexuals ARE being enforced (in the
                    armed forces, - try waving it around in the park as a sign
                    of ""affection"" in the heartland or here in New Hampster
                    and see if the laws are being enforced).
                    And of course we know that things are not going to revert
                    to the bad old days in the closet, right?  Wrong bozo.
                    See below.
 
 
Who sets these accepted values Ken?  You? I sure hope not.  I am
accepted by most people I know.. people I live with, work with, am
friends with, my parents, the rest of my family.  Let's face it, even
with people like you out there, homosexuality is becoming more accepted
around the country.
 
               **  It is not a case of you or I waking up one morning
                   and setting values.  They are ALREADY SET and the
                   homosexual rights movement is trying to change them.
                   That's their whole point - the values are there.
                   I'm reminded of the first Russian soldiers into Berlin.
                   They were very well behaved towards the civilians.  Just
                   interested in killing German soldiers.  But one of them
                   is quoted as saying, ""Look out for those who come behind
                   us.  They are pigs.""  He was right.  And my point here is
                   that you might be a lot better off than you think if I DID
                   set the values.  I'm not for putting you all in jail - yet!
                   You know how some other countries treat homosexuals - and 
                   don't think it couldn't happen here!!!  I admit though,
                   even I have limits:
                       A sea story-> (oh goody) To illustrate my limits.
                       I remember being in a long line in boot camp, short
                       arm inspection or something, and there was this guy
                       on the floor in the hall who couldn't take the whole
                       boot camp bit and was crying.  I felt so bad I wanted
                       to step out of line and comfort him.  Some of the other
                       guys were kicking him as they went by.  By the time I
                       came abreast of him I had decided to kick him too.  So
                       I did!  It's great to be part of a tradition!!
                       Now the point of that little sea story, in case you
                       missed it, is that there are values and there are values.
                       People may give lip service to the idea of homosexual
                       rights but if the lid comes off the homosexual health
                       crisis (seen the T.V. adds about hepatitis?  call this
                       800 # ""to find out if you are in the high risk group""
                       Gee Martha, what group is that?, they're starting to
                       ask in East Overshoe) or too many more stories like
                       the one about the little eight year old girl in Texas
                       a few nights ago (with her mother crying on the couch
                       ""I just want to hold her again and tell her I love her"")
                       who appears to have been taken by a pervert make the 
                       nightly news we may, indeed I say we will, see a DEMAND
                       to ""clean up"".  I quote the sheriff in the town where
                       the little girl was taken, ""If the courts can't protect
                       us, we'll do it ourselves"".  This guy had been let out
                       after several sex offenses.  Of course the mob is going
                       to stop and say, ""No wait, they're only a couple of nice
                       gay boys who don't have anything to do with this.""                                                                    
 
                As for your statement that homosexual behavior is becoming more
                accepted, why there is evidence that that is just not so, even
                with the new T.V. shows. We are just now entering into the time
                when the baby boomers are coming of age and THEY are the ones
                who will be setting the values over the next quarter century!
                Guess what?  They are more conservative than their parents!
                Read the poles.  They are by a huge majority for Reagan and
                his values.  You do know where he stands on the moral issue
                don't you?  But let me quote from a pro homosexual source:
                    1978 poll showed 70% of Americans believed that homosexual
                    acts always wrong even if the people are in love.
                   ""Typically Americans feel that homosexuals can be eliminated
                    by concerted social action.""

                   1977 Gallop poll listed 56% of Americans as saying 
                   homosexuality was due to upbringing or environment.
 
                   (All the above taken from GAYSPEAK:GAY MALE AND LESBIAN
                    COMMUNICATION, Pilgrim Press, N.Y.,1981, pg.ix.)
                    This book, which is well worth looking at, deals with
                    what and who are homosexuals.  Ok so the polls may be
                    dated.  But ask yourself, has the country gotten more or
                    less conservative since then?  Has there been a move back
                    to ""traditional values""?  When is the last time before
                    just now that you saw a liberal democrat hectored by
                    people over traditional values?  Who is Jerry Falwell
                    and why is he able to register the same number or more
                    voters as the Rev. JJ in the south? - he's doing it
                    in all 50 states (ABC news)?   
 
And in reference to the statement 'is MOTSS a microcosm of society', the
definite answer is NO!  Society in general does not use UNIX, does not
post messages to the UUCP net.  And until they do, we have to realize
that we are dealing with a subgroup of humanity, a very select subgroup,
with probably the same amount of homosexuals as the rest of society, but
not your 'average homosexualty'.
               ** don't recognize my making this statement.
And in reference to pedophelia, it DOES NOT BELONG HERE!  Pedophelia is
not limited to gays AT ALL, why stick it  on us.  Sure, it's a problem
but in the same way murder is a problem around society, it's not a
specifically GAY problem.
                ** Keep saying that, . . . as the mob puts the rope around
                   your chicken neck.  Besides I'm only calling you on the
                   part that IS your problem - the gays who ARE pedophelia
                   prone.  But I feel I've answered this in my replies to
                   Richard Johnson and Steve Dyer.
Also, I though you were going, Ken.  Why don't you just do what you said
you were going to do, or admit you like being able to make people mad at
you who you will never see.  I really don't care especially, but I worry
about those people who read motss and never post anything, because I
know that the general consensus is that you are a feeb, and really
should be ignored.
 
              ** Sorry to be such a tease.  And an upset.  I really don't 
                 want to know what the general consensus is (is feeb).
                 I want to know what is right.  Listen Andy, if I'm so wrong,
                 why are you guys so mad?  Like you say just ignore an idiot.
                 I do.  You people are not idiots in my book, just mistaken.
                 But you are close, gang.  I mean have you really read some
                 of the silly statements I've had thrown at me?
 
 
                 I just know you'll wake up tomorrow morning and say I was
                 right and go out and grab a woman.  (If you get stuck on
                 what to do after you grab call me.)

Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny.  AIDS is serum-vectored
not 'homosexual vectored.'  Among the other ailments that are carried
this way are certain forms of hepatitis, mononucleosis, and a large variety
of more common infections.  The first identifiable breakout just happens
to have been in the gay population.  It could have as easily been among
drug addicts, pro football players or army privates.  The first instances
of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century.  That
doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it.  Was the American
Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?
>What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious
>problem to the entire population . . . "" mean??  The point of my postings
>was that very fact!!!
It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place
blame.  That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it
certainly doesn't protect either of us.  Do you have anything constructive
to offer?  If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments.
>I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
>your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
 
Just 'cause your mommy makes you go to bed right after 'The A-Team'
doesn't mean the rest of us work that way, Kenny.
>Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
 
>You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise

>but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
>out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
>Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
 
So what are YOU going to do about it?  If AIDS is in the general population
then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility.  What
are you trying to do?  From the tone and content of your postings all I
can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back!  The smugness
that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune.
I got news for you.  Viruses mutate.  It's what they do.  That's how
the disease got here in the first place according to some.  Should
this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble
and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us 
out of that trouble.

Isn't this all a little like locking the barn door after the horses have
escaped?  I went through the sexual revolution and never even caught cold.
My experience doesn't mean a d*mn thing either.  We agree that AIDS is
a tragedy, now WHAT ARE YOU AND I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

That's why I'm  bothering to reply to you.  Dumping the freaks before they
drag me down with them.  I got little use for someone who sits in corners
and rants and raves, gleefully pointing out victims with a singular lack
of compassion, but hasn't the desire to do something constructive.

So maybe you're not LEAPING!
Maybe not even SCREAMING!
 
I have been called a lot worse.  And sometimes it was true. And sometimes not.
My mention of missing out on the joys (and heartaches) of knowing a woman
was an attempt to raise the issue of what is ""natural"".  (Boswell too easily
discounts the argument Christians make that homosexuality is ""unnatural"".)
But that's another debate.  (In preparation, see C.S. Lewis's book STUDIES
IN WORDS, Cambridge U. Pr.,1967, NATURE, pp.24-74)
 
I don't care if you call me a LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE,  it could become a
term of endearment!  I think you are reaching, to get me to believe that you
were personally offended.  By the way, don't say things like, ""If I was female""
it could give you ideas or something.  See, I care about you.
You sound to me like a Christian reading the laws of perfection when you start
quoting the rules to me.  Hey, you don't really think I'm that bad, do you?
I mean I may toss a bladder at you but I don't hate you or anything.  The time
I said I hate you all (homosexuals) it was (so I thought) so obviously a
facetious remark (remember, I added that it must be so because I was question-
ing your beliefs) that it couldn't be misunderstood.  Wrong!  Someone pointed
it up as 'proof' I was hate filled.
I have never even intimated that I thought homosexuals were not human.
""Never forget that the person on the other side is Human""  In fact, I 
specifically stated to Steve Dyer I didn't even think you were idiots, 
just mistaken!
 
What's wrong with your SO ""filling your life""?  Sure it's a big job!
Are you really not your brother's keeper?  How do you know it's a minority 
that have bathroom sex?  What studies gave you that data?  Just a hunch huh?
I SAID  I was not ""painting all homosexuals with the same brush"" (when I
was talking about child abuse - but the same goes for promiscuity).  Haven't
I made that plain enough?  Of course to Steve Dyer every remark like that I
make is gratuitous.  Who's paranoid now?
I don't think all homosexuals are the same.  That's not my idea of equality.
 
Oh dear.  Bozo!  The forbidden word.  Now THAT'S rude!
What the hell is my 'military defense'?  Tell me so I'll know.  I never said
there were no homosexuals in the military!  Is that what you meant? Of course
gays in service serve their country well.
This season's T.V. shows (for the masses) have more homosexuals in them.
(Norman Lear is really in the pay of Jerry Falwell - getting the masses
to face the question of where homosexals fit in - or out - wanna put it
to a vote by the public?)
No I don't enjoy making people suffer more.  But someone's got to do it!
[Facetious, facetious!)
How do you know Andy doesn't have a chicken neck???  Is that your idea of
""REALLY RUDE""?  Where have you been hanging out?  Not with the big boys.
Again with the ""not my business"" stuff.  Yes Yes Yes the men who rape little
girls (or anyone) are my business.  I make it my business!
Oh boy!  MY MOB'S BIGGER THAN YOUR MOB!  Besides I'm not so stupid as to be
leading the mob.  And I don't need a mob:
                I have . . ahem . . RIGHT on my side!  -:
Gays get WOMEN (girls? boy are you showing your hang-ups - sic'em NOW)
who don't (as a general statement - I can make'em too) want sexual
attachments with men.  I mean gay men, not bisexuals.
Misinformed?  Show me.
Reactionary?  Sure, like someone who defends what's good against change for
the worse.
Slightly insane?  Now if you can tell what is sane in this world we'd all
like to know.
Interesting.  Why thank you.  I find all the people on this net interesting.
As people.  Even though I disagree with some of them.  That's just part of
what makes them interesting.  I even find it interesting that they take
offense so easily.  (I think it says something about them, I mean about
what they believe or believe they believe)
 
I once had a homosexual boss.  Great guy.  Caught hepatitus finally.  One
day I told him his eyes looked yellow and he freaked out.  I had to drive
him to the hospital.  Was he pissed at his SO!  Was I glad I never ate his
sandwich!
I knew a guy who otherwise was normal as rain.  But his goal was to be
EATEN.  I mean cooked and eaten!!!  He's in someone's septic system by
now.  Claimed he knew people in N.Y. who would do it for him.  At first
I thought he was putting me on, but after a few months I believed him.
So see, you guys aren't so strange or fearful to me as some of you have
wondered.
Be glad to meet you for a glass of beer sometime.  (You keep your glass
and I'll keep mine! -: -:)  I looked for you on ELF but you are either
very new at DEC or you didn't really mean you work at DEC.
Oh well, here comes another truck into the loading dock so I have to get
back to work.

other things has prevented me from even looking at net.motss.  I got back so
late, I have missed all of the responses (UCLA dumps them after a month, I
think).  Now I'm back for several months.
In Los Angeles, the political diversity is extreme and many organizations are 
quite active.  I'll try to encapsulate some information about the ones I'm 
familiar with:
CHRISTOPHER STREET WEST
This organization puts on the annual Christopher Street West parade and
festival in July.  The organizers are mainly representatives of the gay bar 
owners and gay-oriented shopkeepers in West Hollywood, and the parade and
festival take on the expected air.  The parade is filled with floats from
different gay bars, dating services, and so forth.  Political groups and
activity-oriented groups are very poorly represented in both the parade and the
festival.  This is partially due to the high price tag of participation, and
perhaps partially due to the biases of the organizers.
The CSW board of directors is quite inbred.  While most community groups
are run by the people that attend meetings regularly, in order to serve on the
CSW board you must be elected by the board itself.  The process involved in
getting on the board takes approximately one year of meeting attendence, plus
making lots of friends on the board.  Once you have been elected to the board,
you can be booted off by an election of the board (and this has been done a
number of times).  A leading member of CSW, George Piazzi, seems to be
extremely conservative.  He is running for a position on the West Hollywood
city council.
There was almost nothing oriented toward gay rights in this year's parade and
festival.  The reason, unfortunately, is quite apparent.
SUNSET JUNCTION STREET FAIR
In sharp contrast to CSW, the people who organize the Sunset Junction Street
Fair (held in late August) are very community-oriented.  Situated in the Silver
Lake area of Los Angeles, Sunset Junction attempts to bring in all segments of
the community.  Silver Lake is populated by gays, latins, and a few orientals.
Sunset Junction incorporates all these elements, with music, food, and
entertainment from each.
There were many political groups represented at Sunset Junction, including
Gay/Lesbian Latinos Unidos, Log Cabin Club, Harvey Milk, ad nauseum.  The theme
seems to be diversity.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how the organization functions.  Probably more
egalitarianly than CSW.
GAY/LESBIAN LATINOS UNIDOS
This group has a number of community-oriented events during the year.  The one
I attended most recently was their annual dinner/dance, where they install
their new officers (elected by vote of members).  It was quite fun.  The food
was excellent and spicy.  I got to sit across the table from Steve Schulte and
his lover, who both appear on the front cover of the late September Advocate.
Steve Schulte is running for West Hollywood city council, and will probably be
the mayor.  He is also an ex-Colt model (politics makes strange bedfellows).
GLLU also has participated in several political events, including the
SurvivalFest held August 5th in central Los Angeles.  They seem to be quite
left-wing, sporting such slogans as ""CIA out of Nicaragua,"" and the like.
GLLU, as far as I know, is a fairly new group, but its membership has grown
rapidly.  I don't know much more about it.
GAY AND LESBIAN ASSOCIATION (GALA)
GALA is the local campus (UCLA) organization.  Its primary purpose, as with
most campus organizations, is to assist in the process of ""coming out.""  Thus,
GALA activities tend to be social, rather than political.  They have regular
""rap sessions,"" regular meetings with speakers on different aspects of gay life
(from AIDS to the Gay Archives), and occasional ""quasi-political"" events.
One such event was the Western Region Gay and Lesbian Conference, held at UCLA.
This drew people from the UC campuses, as well as political heavies from
Sacramento (California's capitol city).
In addition, they organized a letter-writing campaign for AB-1 (California's
gay rights bill).  Because they are a special interest group on campus, with a
big campus budget and an office, they are generally prohibited from doing
anything visibly political, like rallies.
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
There is nothing (political or social) going on here, as far as I know.
Strange, since I know several gays on campus there.  I think the administration
might be homophobic.
SUMMARY
This has been kind of sketchy, but perhaps it gives you a flavor of the kinds
of activities in Los Angeles.  There are several groups I didn't describe,
mostly because I know very little about them.  These include: the Gay and
Lesbian Community Services Center, Harvey Milk Gay Democratic Club, the
Stonewall Democratic Club, the Log Cabin Club (a group of very confused
gays ... they are Republicans), Great Outdoors (a hiking group).

This assertion is about as ludicrous as asking the entire black community
of the United States to ""do"" something about the Zebra killings in SF,
that idiot who called Judiasm a ""gutter religion"", and any other persons
who commit unusual acts and happen to be black. And, the heterosexual
community has its share of pedophiles, too - do you intend to ""do"" something
about that ? Why do you believe that the majority of pedophiles are gay ?

          > Need you ask if I have comments!  
            Zebra killings are what a handful of blacks did - agreed.
            Child abuse is what a minority of homosexuals do - agreed.
 
            Now, watch closely, because I also agree that this may sound 
            like convoluted reasoning and is pretty hard to get a handle on - 
            hard to quantify.  I don't think your point about blacks and
            homosexuals being analogous fits in this case, because blacks 
            by and large have won their battle for acceptance, their moral
            case anyway.  I think that very few, on hearing of the Zebra
            killings would say ""isn't that just like blacks?"".  Indeed,  
            that was your point, wasn't it.  The question is, have the
            homosexuals gained acceptence as a rightful minority?  Even
            they say no.  Therefore, it seems to me that many if not most
            people, upon hearing of NAMBLA or the Rene Guyon Society WOULD
            link them with all homosexuals.  Witness the concern over
            allowing homosexual teachers!!  Now homosexuals say that they
            should not be viewed this way - you have heard their statements
            on this net vis a vis teaching.  Homosexuals may be right in
            their statements but I don't think that they have gotten the
            agreement of the majority of parents out there, do you?  Ergo,
            if access to the workplace, etc. is an issue the homosexual
            community still has some work to do.  See my recent posting
            (ignore the swamp gas he engenders from me) to Steve Dyer on
            this point.
            I never said that the ""Silent Shame"" T.V. show was strictly
            about homosexuals!!!  Only that it highlighted an interview
            with the Rene Guyon Society.  I referenced the show as another
            source of information about them.  I don't know where you got
            the idea that I believe child abuse is strickly or even mostly
            a homosexual issue!  
 
            I just reread my posting on ""chickenhawks"" and I would like you
            to do the same.  My exact wording was: ""Did anyone see the T.V.
            show 'Silent Shame'?  They MENTIONED (italics mine!!)
            chickenhawks.""  I really don't see how you leap from that 
            statement to my saying it was a homosexual theme show and I
            believe, etc.

Ken,
    Wherever did you get the idea that blacks have won their battle ? Just
because the legislation exists doesn't make them 100% free yet. I'm sure I
don't need to give you examples. But then, neither are *any* groups (I won't
use minorities here - the WASPs will soon be the minority) 100% free from the
primitive prejudices of Our Wonderful Country. You and I both know there is 
a white, predominantly male ruling class. Period. To what degree acceptance
is made shouldn't be an issue. Thirty years ago, blacks were in just about
as high favor as gays. If not worse, due to their visibility in the society.
Sure, they've paid their dues. We gave them no choice. Ditto homosexuals. 
Where is the logic in disputing another's right to LIVING AS THEY PLEASE, 
when your forebearers fought for the same thing ? If not you yourself ?
I could be wrong, but sometimes I think you still are stinging from your own
search for *whatever*, and want to make sure others have a tough time. 
Fuck this issue of genetics/hormones/choice/too much peanut butter before
age 13. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JUST LIVING YOUR LIFE AS YOU PLEASE ? I don't
advocate messing with other people's lives, either. But then, I have told
a Baptist preacher to go fuck himself to his face for bothering me with his
paranoid convictions. 
     An analogy I read recently: Why can't homosexuality be like buying 
shoes ? Just because you don't like the shoes doesn't mean you run into
the shoe store and bludgeon the owner. I hear you on the AIDS issue and
promiscuity. I hear you on unsafe sexual practices in general, exclusive
of preferences. I hear you on pedophiles. But your arguement about 'we
still have to pay dues' (not any sort of quote) is falling on deaf ears.

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the
above advice.  With a friend like you....(1/2 smiley face here)

Sour grapes here?  You should abstain from telling people to abstain
& continue the discussion so you can read my posting in the near fu-
ture about biblical texts (another 1/2 smiley face!).

Chickenhawks indeed!!!!
Is this discussion going to turn into another piece of homogenized crap
on the general topic of homosexual ""lifestyles"" without anyone other than
myself speaking up?  Despite Ken Perlow's assertion to the contrary, I very
clearly said I was speaking against PROMISCUOUS behavior and invited others
to examine that as a ""lifestyle"" issue in light of its physical (AIDS, etc.)
and psychological implications.  I believe I remember one, maybe two people
addressing the issue as minor points in their postings.
Did anyone see the recent T.V. ""Silent Shame"" show about child abuse?  They
mentioned ""chickenhawks"".  Had a member of the Rene Guyon Society (10,000
members in the U.S.) who came right out and SAID what they say in their
literature!  They have a RIGHT to our kids!!!!!!  WE are wrong for not letting
them have them!!!  They want LAWS!!!  Hey, the ""right"" SS will march if 
this gets anywhere.  
SO OTHER THAN A FEW WEAK, ""I DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS"", HOW DO THE MEMBERS OF
THE NET FEEL?   For, against, won't march with them, not your problem (if you
believe that you're crazy), might even speak out against them (Why?)???
But read from their literature:
ANAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT (italics
theirs), can easily hold after massage, and will be allowed to have a teen-
ager or older male's condom-covered penis in their anus.  Tiny children will
be required to wear a small ""finger stall"" or ""finger cot"" (obtainable from
a drug store) condom from age 4 or any earlier age that they start penetrating
male and female anuses.  99% of the day there is no fecal matter in the anus.
No enema is required.
ORAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT, can easily
hold, and will be allowed to have a tiny child, teenager, or older male's penis
in their mouth.  This will bring an end to thumbsucking.  The child will at 
last get valuable hormones that appear in the mature male's ejaculate that have
been denied children in the past.  Very young, teenage and adult females will
be allowed to provide sexual satisfaction with their mouths and tongues to the
penis and clitoris of young children.
------------------------------
And it goes on, PENIS-VAGINA COPULATION, MASTURBATION, NUDITY ALONE WITH NO
SEXUAL ACTIONS, but I'm sick of typing what I'm typing.
 
The main purpose of the organization is to convince the public that all laws
controlling nonconsensual sex must be abolished.
The above are part of a promotional package handed out by the Society as a
summary of the revisions to the California Penal Code proposed by them.

Penis-Vagina Copulation and PC288 & 288.1 Masturbation of a Child.

NOW PLEASE NOTE:  I am NOT trying to tar all homosexuals with the same brush.
I am asking the homosexual community just what they propose to do about these
people in their movement. (I know what I propose to do)  Something, nothing??
It would really freak me out to see you pass over this topic as if it were
like wearing women's undergarments.
Question:  Is this a topic that is just to early to push for acceptance by
the public?  I mean, after the law recognizes homosexual ""rights"" is this
the next barrier?  Is there any last barrier?  Or will someone really marry
a tree?

haven't seen anything quite like this before.  What mailing lists is he
on anyway?
Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rights
very early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for total
self-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this was
not limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referred
to) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them.  I
don't think there's much more to be said here.
All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly try
to dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA.  The key to
remember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and the
only groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and the
members of such groups themselves.  Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerpts
from pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of both
female and male children: where are the gay issues here?  Why did Arndt not
take this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,
where he could take the straight community to task for their own shameful
members?  Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.
One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.
Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to
""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,
""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""
Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gay
community (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gay
community.)  Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very small
minority supports the aims of such groups, with most people either
against or indifferent.
One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS and
promiscuity haven't received a response.  Nope, they haven't, and it's no
wonder.  Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, but
unfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority of
net.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior.  It's actually pretty
hilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needs
to do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guise
of martyr.  Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, and
by my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlier
behavior.  We'll see.

Oh boy, another California lunatic fringe group, and Arndt goes all to
pieces.  So Arndt, are you German, or of German heritage?  If so, what
are you going to do about Germany's neo-Nazis?  Or closer to home,
the American Nazi Party?  When you hear Meir Kahane speak, do you
assume that he speaks for all Jews?  Or Jerry Falwell for all Christians?
Sometimes the best strategy w/r/t loonies is to ignore them.

	I have been following the conversation somewhat episodically over 
the last few months, due to problems with local (computer!) 
authorities, but I could not help noticing the extent to which 
the responses to Mr. Arndt and his clones have managed to force 
their way into nearly every single letter written to this group. 
This has now progressed to the point where all of the letters currently
available at my institution in this newsgroup are either written by the 
Arndt Gang, or are replies to them. This situation is not new: 
many of you probably remember that
Arndt managed for some time to disrupt the debate also in net.women, from 
which he was eventually expelled, never to reappear again. It is unlikely,
though, that this will happen here too: differently from that case, now 
Mr. Arndt is persuaded to be waging a Holy War, and nothing we say will
make him desist from it. You all know how impermeable he is to every sort
of argumentation, how uninterested he is in listening, and how badly he has
damaged discussion in this group.
	There are two possible soultions to this problem: the first is what 
was proposed some time ago in net.women, i.e. the creation of a private 
mail group from which any non-constructive contribution could be easily 
excluded. This feminist mail group is now alive and prospering, has received
more than 300 contributions, and the environment is so pleasant that 
quite a number of people have told intimate personal stories. This is a 
possible way out. 
	Alternatively, one may reason as follows: women's movements have 
gained a degree of acceptance which gay-rights movements are very far from
achieving, so that the retreat into a private mailgroup, which would be
quite acceptable for women, is to be considered a political defeat in this
case. Holding the debate in a public forum like this is also a part 
of 'coming out', and we shouldn't allow Mr. Arndt and his clones to shut
evryone up, and lock the closet again.
	I see some pluses in this line of argument. But in this case, 
we should probably accept the obvious: no debate is possible with Mr. Arndt
and the hypocrites who disapprove of his ways and approve of his ideas 
(which ones?) and of his carefully researched data (straight out of 
Jerry Falwell's pocket). We should then propose and enforce a policy of
total neglect of Mr. Arndt, one by which none of his arguments is mentioned
in any contribution, none of his lurid jokes and insinuations are 
answered, none of his clones' support respected.
	This is very different from rejecting debate: it would only
mean restoring this forum to its original function (message # 1):
>Net.motss is designed to foster discussion on a wide variety of topics, such as
>health problems, parenting, relationships, clearances, job security and
>many others.  Gay members of USENET will find this a supportive environment

With all this talk about ""hey, he had some valid points"",
Let's not get too awed by Arndt's insightfulness.  Taking all
that timely and useful info on AIDS as completely true, clearly
a guy who can use the word ""teleology"" in a sentence correctly
should be able to distinguish some behaviors of some homosexuals
from the essence of homosexuality.  The fact that the causes
of AIDS and homosexuality are both unknown does not make them
equivalent.  Can you pronounce the word ""spurious"", Ken?  Good.
Watch the spelling though--only one ""r"".
Yet, when you cut through Arndt's homopobia, ad hominems, and wet dreams
over Sophie Quigley's breasts, what's left is a surprisingly altruistic
plea.  Let me see if I can state it so you don't feel like putting your
fist through the screen:
Lots of casual sex, by members of any sex, is an epidemiologist's
nightmare.  Yes, ""even Pekingeses in the Ritz do it"", but whirlwind sex
is perceived as the alpha and omega of gays' existence by the ever
growing right wing.  (I take Ken's word for that, too.)  So, gays
are going to get blamed for all sorts of bad things, and it will get
worse as the diseases get worse and/or gays get more visible.  You
don't think so?  There's more of a link between gays and AIDS than
there was between Jews and Germany's post-WWI economy.  All it takes
is a little despair.  Add a tablespoon of political crisis and one
demagogue.  Shake well.  The people needs a scapegoat.  Always has.
So, Ken seems to be worried that the message of ""gay pride"" hasn't
been focused well enough to reassure him and his friends that the pride
has to do with the OK-ness of homosexuality, not casual sex.  AIDS is
very scary, and if it becomes salient in the straight community, a lot
of fear-crazed people may come looking for a very easy answer.  Ken
would rather not be muttering ""I told you so"" as he hides you from a
lynch mob or its all-nice-and-legal-like, first-we-try-'em-then-we-
hang-'em equivalent.
There is an urgency in Arndt's (and other homophobes') postings that
needs to be addressed.  Homosexuality is *threatening* to these
people, and they'll fight it.  What can be done?

I don't mind him though.  (Never you mind.)
But all that stuff about the lower intestinal tract, and bowels, and . . .
Uh, all that stuff.
Excuse me, but, what has that really got to do with being gay?
Being gay doesn't mean you have a desire to engage in certain acts.
Being gay means you like cuddling with other guys.  That you really
enjoy their company.  Aren't there straights that engage in the acts
Arndt described?  I could swear I've read about stuff like that in
Penthouse's FORUM.  (I didn't get it, my mother did.  She gave a copy
to me and two college buddies to read on a long ferry ride.  She only
got it because she wanted to see the Miss America stuff.)  Are they
[the straights described in FORUM who engage in anal sex] just as bad,
in Arndt's view?
Being gay is not about sex; it is about love and affection.
Or am I naive?
Mr. Arndt stirs my emotions.  It makes me defensive.  I certainly hope
I'm not a health risk.  I take precautions.  Mr. Arndt, why don't you
advocate that gays take care to insure that they minimize their chance
of getting AIDS?  I don't see where you get off knocking the Gay Men's
Health Crisis people.  If you're so concerned why don't you man one of
their hotlines?  Not your problem, huh.  Easier to criticize.
Everyone takes health risks.  The air quality is low today.  Can I have
a sip of your Pepsi?  Buckle up.  How do those new headphones sound?
Gee, that looks good.  55 saves lives.  Look both ways.  Should we change
the sheets?  Are you gonna finish that?  Don't sit so close to the TV.
Boy, did you get tanned.  Biological.  Physical.  Chemical.  God Bless You!
There are gay guys that choose to engage in activities which are currently
very risky.  Like anal sex with strangers.  These gay guys don't do things
like that because they are gay.  They do it because they are either stupid,
uninformed, or irresponsible.  Or maybe lost.  These things are unrelated to
being gay.  Being gay just has to do with whom you choose as your companion.
Also, Mr Arndt, attitudes like yours only make things worse.  How?  Well,
it goes like this.  Little Johnny is either going to be straight, or be gay.
There is no proven method for determining or setting this course.  There is
just nothing that has been shown to be effective in persuading Johnny about
whom he should choose for his companion.  BUT, you can have an effect on
how Johnny expresses his desires.  Attitudes like yours, Mr. Arndt, make
Johnny feel like a real worthless piece of shit.  If I were Johnny, and I
met you, I wouldn't feel so hot about myself.  So Johnny tries to go about
expressing his desires in ways that won't cause the people he loves to
suddenly hate him.  I'm not saying Mr. Arndt that YOU would disown your son
if you found out that he were gay.  It's just that, with the attitudes you
express, he would have good reason to believe that he might lose a little of
your affection for him.  You see, the persecution of gays is what causes
gays to do the things that the persecutors see as unfavorable.  If Johnny
knew deep down in his heart that you wouldn't have him any other way then
maybe he'd be proud to bring home the boy he met at the ice cream parlor.
To see if you approved of this boy.  To see how you felt about this boy
maybe becoming a part of the Arndt's extended family.  But no, Johnny
would never bring his ice cream parlor boy home to you Mr. Arndt.  In fact,
if you were Johnny's dad, Johnny would never be able to really love another
gay person because he would be filled with too much self-hatred.  Making
people hate themselves, and feel bad about themselves isn't good for anyone.
Mr. Arndt, you don't make me feel good about myself.  You don't make me feel
good about being gay.  Why do you enjoy being so mean, huh?  I'm sorry, I
just don't ever see the greatest good being serviced by hate.  You seem to
have a lot of hate Mr. Arndt.  You may not think so, but ask around.  Your
heart certainly is not filled with love when you talk about gays.  Ah, but
that's not your problem & it's easier to criticize.
If you want to go on making people feel real bad about themselves, then just
keep doing what you've been doing Mr. Arndt.  It won't drive ME into the
bushes searching for a little self-affirmation of my worth.  I know what
you're up to.  But I sympathize with Johnny who feels so ultimately unloved
that he would rather risk death than face constant isolation of the soul.
Mr. Arndt, it's not that I don't like hearing about AIDS.  In fact I do;
after all, I want to know what I can do to avoid getting it.  But I don't
like hearing about it from you.  I don't think anyone thinks your looking
out for them when you send out your warnings about AIDS.  They're not even
warnings, they're taunts.
I'm done now.  In the future I'll just 'n' over your articles unless I see
the word 'love' in the subject line.  You can use that as a cue to all us
net.motss'ers so we'll know when you've changed your tune.
Goodbye, Mr. Arndt.  It's been o.k. chatting with you.
I apologize to you for the public nature of this letter,
but my hope is that other people will benefit by reading it.
That's usually why I post articles.
Another Letter For The Arndt File from

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much
of this article was taken.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of
what Arndt wrote--you don't have to choose a side on any of the underlying
issues to label what he wrote ""stupid in the extreme"".

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays. 
Important disclaimer from you is ""gay men"". Right, women don't fit
in the hypothesis so nicely.

Ken Arndt starts an irrational argument along the following lines:  ""Defend
yourselves according to the way I have defined a valid moral position"".
Sorry, Mr. Arndt, but I'd rather debate the proposition:  ""Given that the
sky is red, prove that it's not red.""  Given the premise, both arguments
place me in an indefensible position, despite the fact that each has a
rather absurd premise.
On top of this, Arndt greets every reply with insult and ridicule.  Granted
he himself was greeted in several instances with insult and ridicule, but
ignored in the mess were any attempts that were made to point out to Arndt
just how biased and unreasonable his position is.  Arndt refuses to give
ground on his premises, accusses us of ""not having any answers,""
and ignores any that were presented in favor of baiting us further on the
issue.  Sorry again, Mr. Arndt, but your argument was well dealt with, but
if you're going to refuse to deal with the responses with a certain degree of
detachment, I suppose you won't really understand why.
Then along comes Plunkett, who accusses us merely of throwing temper tantrums,
dismisses us as a group as being defensive and petulant (among other equally
bizarre generalizations) and accusses us not merely of trying to find acceptance
but of proselytizing.  (Gee, {Mr, Ms} Plunkett, who asked for *your* phone
number?)  Then, of course, despite the fact that we shouldn't throw temper
tantrums, we must learn to put up with profanity from others.  Gosh, okay--
we'll be good and perfect and quietly take the abuse as it comes.
Now, I don't necessarily agree with Steve Dyer's suggestion concerning what
ought and ought not to be discussed in this newsgroup.  But the point comes
when discussion on this topic is no longer fruitful--and that point was
at least reached when the gay members of this group were required to argue
on the grounds of invalid premises if at all, or when attempts to explain
why homosexuality is valid are taken to be acts of proselytizing.  Providing
a forum where people might rationally discuss ideas is one thing; providing
a forum for name-calling is quite another.  I find it rather odd that the
people who pose questions in this group seem so unwilling to listen to the
answers.
As for questions, Plunkett poses one about public health.  Or so he says
that he does; actually he uses this as another attempt to vindicate his
viewpoint.  So I will address both:  AIDS (oh, my GOD--he said the word)
is not a consequence of being gay; if it were then it would strike lesbians
as well as gay men and it would not strike others who are not gay.  And as
an argument against homosexuality, at best it wins a temporary victory--
if that is why it's not ok to be gay, then being gay was okay before its
outbreak and will be again once it is able to be effectively treated.
Sorry, but I can't even grant it that; even though I'm gay I will probably
not contract AIDS but will probably die in an auto accident instead; I guess
that God must therefore hate the automobile because he uses it to draw so
many of us into the arms of Abraham.
There--a logical answer, without the hint of a temper tantrum.  Now I guess
I'll just have to wait and see if anyone can understand it.

 joining groups, making choices, and comparing being ""happy as a homosexual""
 with being ""unhappy as a stereotypical macho asshole"">
Between the back and forth banter about who's a bigot and who's not, and
the discussions on jerks versus nice guys, and the other assorted flambazes,
I've been relatively quiet.  But I see a lot in common in all of these
somewhat disjoint discussions.
First off, I got some flack when I said a few weeks ago that sexuality was a
matter of personal choice.  George Labelle and Alan Wexelblat pounced on me
for that, saying 1) that they could never see themselves simply ""choosing""
some alternate sexuality [LABELLE], and 2) that there are people who have 
homosexual desires who feel evil/sinful for having them, though they cannot
rid themselves of such desires [WEXELBLAT].  Alan's point, apparently, was
that such people do not make a choice, that they are trapped by inborn/internal
feelings.  Yet they clearly ARE making a choice!  They are saying:  ""I don't
like having homosexual feelings.  I don't want to be a homosexual.  I want to
be a heterosexual.""  If such a choice is made in a positive way (""I want to
be sexually attracted to MOTOSs, but I cannot.""), then one can only hope that
some psychological assistance may someday get them what they want.  But (and
this seems more likely), if the choice is made in a negative way (""I don't
want to be a homosexual because being homosexual is wrong and I would be a
lesser person for being one.""), then that would be truly sad.  Sad because
things like low self-esteem (even self-hatred) and feelings of guilt are seen
as reasons to WANT not to be what they are.  Which gets us back to the original
offering from Jeff Sargent that started this whole discussion.  Do these
people ""not want to be"" as they are because they have chosen to want to be
something else, or is the self-hatred and/or guilt manifesting itself to the
point where it is themselves that they want to be ""rid of"", and not the
elements of their psychological make-up?
Which brings me to the content of a series of conversations I have had via mail
with Steve Dyer.  I put forth the point that there are some people who make the
choice to be gay, not because they are sexually attracted to MOTSSs, but rather
because they feel things in common with the gay community:  having mannerisms
and behaviors *associated* by the non-tolerant general public with being gay
(often stronger and more malicious epithets are used), not fitting with the
stereotypical straight behavior patterns, not engaging in activities
""appropriate"" to your ""assigned"" gender roles (or engaging in inappropriate
ones).  Joining the gay or lesbian community seems an appropriate choice for
such people precisely because of the commonality that they share with members
of the chosen community, but it does not seem to be a rational reason for
choosing homosexuality as a sexual lifestyle, unless indeed one is sexually
attracted to MOTSSs.
Around this time, Trish Millines fired the shot heard 'round the net, with the
echoes still reverberating.  For those of you who have forgotten what Trish
said after all the back-and-forth between 'rainbow' (Robert ? -- sorry) and
Alan Driscoll that followed... well, I've forgotten a lot of it, too.  But the
crux of the discussion that followed revolved around her statement that she
was a lesbian BECAUSE she thought the men she had come in contact with were
generally (""generally"" is probably not strong enough a word) assholes.  Well,
Alan thought that was a prime example of bigotry, and that bigotry from a
member of an oppressed group towards an oppressor (lesbians cf. men) was
bigotry just the same.  From there it was a series of volleys that led into
mass disorder.  But among the things that did come out were these:  1) Yes,
Trish's choice appears to be a ""negative"" choice, somewhat like the ones I
describe above (in that she said she chose to be a lesbian based not on being
attracted to women, but rather on being repulsed by men), 2) Compare it to
eating vegetables.  When I was a kid, I had a violent reaction to eating
eggplant; several times (I threw up).  What would you say was the likelihood
of such a kid wanting to eat eggplant thereafter?  I'd venture to say that
Trish's experiences with men is roughly analogous to my experiences as a child
with eggplant. (Aha!!  A new slogan!!  A woman without a man is like Rich Rosen
without eggplant. :-)  For me there were lots of other foods I could still
choose from (like chocolate :-))))))).  For Trish, if she wanted to have sexual
relationships, there was only one other sex to choose from.  Of course, I could
have tried to (and eventually I did) eat eggplant once again later on in life.
I could just as easily have chosen not to. I don't think I would have if, after
trying it again, I had the same reaction.  Infer from this what you like...
Which, in turn, leads me to the other point I wanted to make.  A lot of people,
males, Alan Driscoll and Greg Woods among them, took umbrage at Trish's
generalizations about men.  But how unjustified was that generalization?
Behavior like that which Trish described seems to be the status quo and not
the exception among so-called modern American males.  Pick the statement apart,
and you'll find that what it really meant (though Trish did not say this
outright) was that 99% of the men she has met BEHAVED like macho assholes!!
Yup, you've got guys out there who put on that whole act (yeah, for some it's
no act, it comes naturally!) just because they want to impress their friends,
or because they think they have to, or because they don't know any other
behavior.  (Like Sharon Badian said in her article on how behaviors propagate
from parent to child:  if a boy sees that kind of behavior in his father, he's
likely to grow up to be the same way; and, apropos to the ""woman who marry/date
jerks"" discussion, if a girl sees her mother accepting that sort of behavior
from her father as the status quo, she's likely to grow up expecting that in
a boyfriend/husband/other SO MOTOS type.)
Roughly, that's the inverse of the behavior I described earlier.  In that,
some people ""become"" gay/lesbian because they feel a commonality with gays/
lesbians based on other factors than sexuality.  (As Sophie Quigley mentioned,
some people make such decisions as a sort of sociopolitical statement rather
than a statement of sexual preference.)  On the other hand, other
people fulfill stereotypical heterosexual sex roles (like macho provider male
and obedient sex-object female) because they think they're supposed to or
because they don't know anything else.  Basically, I think it's pure
unadulterated bullshit for someone to feel they have to join a particular
group (e.g., homosexuals) because they have things in common with its members,
only to be forced to ""adhere"" to other ""requirements"" for being in that group
unrelated to one's own individuality.  And it's just as much bullshit to be
required to fit into the stereotypical roles defined for groups that you are a
member of (e.g., heterosexuals).  Actually, I could have just as easily
interchanged the positions of my ""e.g.""'s, there.  Or I could have given
numerous other examples of groups (religions, nationalities) that would fit the
bill just as well.
I don't pretend to know where Trish Millines fits in to all of this.  And, with
that in mind, I'm unfit to make speculations about why she made the choice she
did and about the relative merits of that choice.  And, in all likelihood, so
are the rest of us.  Trish excepted.
I *can* speak for me; and I, for one, don't appreciate stereotypical sex roles,
or being expected by other people to adhere *to* them.  Being called an
""asshole"" by someone who expects me to behave a certain way because I'm male
repulses me just as much as being called a ""queer"" by someone who finds I don't
behave that same certain way.  I generally wouldn't appreciate other people
telling me what group I should belong to, would you?  (Especially when those
people don't even like the groups they put you in.)

that made me want to post to this newsgroup.  The article dealt with the
banning of public sex at San Francisco's bathhouses.  One point that was
brought up was `where does such legislation stop?'.  The measure was
meant to reduce the spread of AIDS by ""eliminating???"" anonymous sex among
gay males.  There seems to be many people on both sides of this argument,
and I would like to be included in the group against this law.  Agreed, the
spread of AIDS is bad, but the passage of such laws are equally bad for the
gay movement.  I am NOT saying that I am for public sex or agreeing that such
behavior is okay.  Actually, I have no strong feelings for or against it.
What I *AM* wondering about is;  was this law passed in the name of preventing
the spread of disease or simply a way of eliminating a rather icky practice.
Can such laws really reduce the number of anonymous sexual encounters?  It
was always my understanding that many such encounters could at least start in
any public place and then finish in private.  Right?  Gays crusing in bars
are usually looking for 'a good time' and not merely looking to get drunk.
A logical progression would be to close down ALL places where gays could
meet with the hopes of picking someone up for sex.  I don't think this last
statement is too far off the mark, given many of the statements I've seen
by your friend and mine, the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
Anyway, maybe this will stimulate some thought about what could someday
affect YOU.  (and possibly stimulate some more contibutions to net.motss)

is a regulation by the Public Health Department in order to slow down
the ""epidemic"" of AIDS.  That being beside the point when discussing,
""Where does it stop?"".
I tend to agree that this sets a bad preceedent.  Part of the struggle
for gay rights that I have been involved in for about 15 years, was to
get the ""straights"" out of our sex lives... wherever we decide to have
them at.  (Although, on the other hand, I do not think that sex should
be practiced in public places like parks, the bathroom at Macy's, etc.)
Part of the reason for bathhouses was to remove a large quanity of public
sex to ""private"" places that allowed the persons involved to meet in
somewhat more dignity than the parks provide.  Also, I still remember
bathhouse raids in days of yore, when police ran hundreds of nearly
naked men out into the streets to be arrested and harassed.
I do not not wish to go back to the past.  We need to get far more
organized to prevent this kind of thing in the future.  Also, we need
to fight AIDS on the level where it will do some good, i.e. in the
medical labs, rather than having to deal with these shortsighted
and damaging ""solutions"".

as difficult as making the decision to come out.  The reason I came out was
because I felt I could never lead a normal life as long as I was hiding such
a large part of my life.  How can you think positively about yourself if you
are constantly negating yourself?
How do you choose the right moment to come out to someone?  Well, I really
didn't want to make a big thing out of it - it shouldn't be a big deal - so
when someone would ask me what I did over the weekend, I'd tell them I went
dancing with Rick at the Foxhole, or I went to chorus rehearsal (Oh? What
chorus?  The Denver Gay Men's Chorus).  This kept me from acting a scene
out of ""True Confessions"", and allowed them to gloss over the matter without
a confrontation.
Coming out to my parents was different.  Whatever reaction they had, I didn't
want them to think they made me gay.  They could hate me, feel sorry for me,
anything, as long as they wouldn't think they were responsible.  As it turned
out, what hurt my mother most was that I hadn't told her sooner.  She still
worries about me (she's afraid I'll get knifed by a psychopathic lover, or
get AIDS), but I'm closer to my family than I've ever been before.
A note to women:  Please, please don't feel that your input is not wanted!
This newsgroup is as much for lesbian issues as for gaymale ones.  For that
matter, no one ever said you had to be gay to comment on gay topics.

we've been having to decide which newsgroups can be thrown away and
which should be kept.  (I'm marking this to Followup-To to net.news,

This started with some angry glares following a high phone bill.
We took a look at the top 25 newsgroup list and found that about 45%
of the traffic listed there was of questionable quality and need.
I wrote my 'subscribers' shell script and set it running for awhile
to gather data for me, and the following list is the result.
This list has been posted to the local newsgroups and we'll have
some local voting and discussion about it, with a final decision being
reached in a week or two.  BTW, I've purposely put too many newsgroups
on this list because I'm hoping to jog some people into action.
For instance, net.bizarre actually has enough readers but is of
such low quality that I don't think anybody will miss it, and is
of such high volume that it'll make a big dent in our phone bills
if we throw it away.
Why am I posting a local administrative matter to the net
as a whole?  I'm hoping to raise consciousness on the net, and

Hopefully this will be the only large posting (And, please people,
don't quote the entire thing!)

David, sorry for the long inclusion, but there are two points:
1. Am I not getting all of net.music.folk? As a ""folkie"" I eagerly await the
   one or two posting per week average I see here. Hardly what I would call
   middle to high volume. Perhaps there is a site somewhere upstream of us that
   has decided that this group is worthless and has turned it off.
2. A small but not insignificant contributor to article length is.. (I know,
   it's been said a hundred times before!) long .signature files. I consider
   7 lines long (please, this isn't intended to be a flame!).

	We just went through the same problem, but since we are a computer
science department, we decided to keep only computer related groups.
The only large groups that we still get are net.sources and net.unix-wizards.
We managed to cut out about 75% of our news, the administration is happy,
and we realized how much of the news is crap.  All the talk about information
overload and the net collapsing under it's own weight is apparently true.

net.abortion, net.politics, net.flame, net.religion, and net.origins are the
kind of groups that by their natures seem to distribute a large amount of
opinion, especially of the I'm-right-you're-wrong-and-that's-all-there-is-
to-it sort. The justifications for creating net.abortion and net.origins (as
I recall) were that people were overflowing other notesfiles (lots of
abortion debates in net.women, lots of creationism debates in net.religion,
and lots of both in net.flame). Rather than try and convince people not to
rehash the same debates over and over, they were given their own pastures
and left to run wild. I personally would not miss any of them, and it would
certainly go a long way towards reducing phone bills.
Oddly, I don't think net.motss fits this category. This notesfile serves
several purposes. It is an obvious vehicle for disseminating information on
AIDS, at least until it begins to affect heterosexuals in larger numbers. It
is used by people who are different from most of the people they work with
to communicate with others like them across the country, with little
harassment (aside from Ken Arndt's random visits and those of shocked
bible-belters). It is also a way for straights to learn more about how gays
think and live, and education has to make acceptance easier, right?
And then we come to the groups close to my heart: net.aviation,
net.sf-lovers, and net.books. You can't justify groups like these as easily
as something like mod.sources, but many, many people read sf-lovers, not all
books are sf so it's nice to have net.books, too, (shouldn't we support
reading in this age of declining literacy?), and wherever you get a group of
pilots together they're bound to swap flying stories, and I love to listen
to flying stories. What would Jeff Williams do with himself if you did away
with net.aviation?
And while I don't read it myself, if there are readers in net.railroad I
think it should stay around, just out of respect for all the old- and
not-so-old-timers who got into this business through messing with model
railroads and blue boxes.

I think the point that krahl missed is that David posted a list of
newsgroups that were candidates for HIS SITE to stop supporting.  He
is in the process of finding out whether anyone on HIS SITE can make
a case for keeping any of the groups.  I did the exact same thing on
one machine I administer news on a few months ago, cut the disk space
used by about 20%, and the space used is currently higher than it was
before trimming groups that NO ONE ON MY SITE WANTED.  I am administering
news on a smaller machine now, as well.  The machine has a total of
102Meg of disk space and we get very few groups to start with.  Do the
news administrators have the right to stop supporting groups that should
be mailing lists (low volume) or moderated but aren't (low quality)?
You're damn right, we do.  If my users can't get their work done because
netnews is tying up too much disk space, or too many cycles, or too many
hours on the FOUR incoming or ONE outgoing lines on the system, we won't
support ANY groups at all.  Even in some parts of AT&T, the budget
allotment for netnews is ZERO dollars.  If krahl wants to pass around
a lot of crap with his cycles and dialers, fine.   I'll pass, thank you.

The first thing I noticed was where these two people are *from*!  The one
is an AT&T employee and probably doesn't have to worry about his phone
bills (:-).  The second is from a University and is expressing the exact
opinions which have been expressed around here.  i.e.  Given a limited 
amount of support for receiving news and a seemingly unlimited supply
of news, why is *EVERYTHING* necessary???
Yes, Mr. Krahl, I do want to lower the phone bill by cutting newsgroups.
And, no, I won't kill the net by doing so because I'm not asking the
net to kill newsgroups, I'm simply intending to cut them locally.  On
the other hand, if the net were to see this suggestion and agree that
all those newsgroups were worthless and needed to be cut I wouldn't cry.
What's a poor university to *do*?!?!?

Actually, when you're talkinga about removing availability of groups from a
small population, it makes sense to sample that population. If you're
talking about removing groups from a large population, you need a more
scientific approach. It WAS interesting, though to compare his stuff to
what is happening out here in the bay area where people are doing
readership surveys on a regional basis... I found it rather suprising which
groups don't seem to have a lot of following on a pretty wide ranging
basis.

Meese and his perceived shortcomings.  That's all very well, and I have no
objection to people flaming at Meese if they want to.  But then Mr. Thau
goes on to issue a paragraph of what he must have known were flagrant lies,
in what has got to be one of the most intellectually dishonest statements
to go across the net since I've been reading it.
Strong language, I know.  But look at this.
Mr. Thau writes:

>Robert Thau
Mr. Thau here makes three claims, each of which is absolutely false, and
none of which is difficult to check.  He claims that:
	1.  In recent issues of National Review, William F. Buckley, Jr.
	    has opposed (Mr. Thau's phrase is ""inveighed against"") court
	    protection of the rights of homosexuals,
	2.  Buckley has editorialized against the Gramm-Rudman ""balance
	    the budget"" bill,
   and  3.  He ""seems blissfully unaware"" that a line-item veto would
	    require a constitutional amendment.
Now I generally read the National Review, pretty carefully.  When I saw Mr.
Thau's posting, I thought it was odd, because I didn't remember Buckley's
having written anything about Gramm-Rudman *or* homosexual rights.  So
I went and reread every word Buckley has written in National Review since
September.  In the last eight issues of the National Review, nowhere,
absolutely *NOWHERE*, does Buckley say the things Mr. Thau tries to make us
believe he said.
The *only* thing even vaguely related to homosexuality written by Buckley
in those eight issues is a short column on AIDS in school-age children,
in which he explicitly says he is *not* in favour of quarantine, and that
homosexuality should make *no difference* in how the law treats AIDS
victims.  There's not a word, anywhere, signed by Buckley or not,
advocating that homosexual's rights be curtailed, ignored, abridged, or
anything of the sort.  As far as I can tell, Mr. Thau simply made it all up.
As for Gramm-Rudman, National Review's only editorial mention of the bill
was in an *unsigned* editorial, which from the style I would guess was
written by Linda Bridges.  (Buckley's columns appear over his signature
in every issue.)  This unsigned editorial may well have been the source
of Mr. Thau's fantacizing about Buckley and Gramm-Rudman.  It indeed
opposes Gramm-Rudman, in part because its passage would hurt the prospects
for a line-item veto.  But not even this unsigned piece could possibly be
construed as being ""blissfully unaware"" of anything.
And Thau has the nerve to complain about ""hypocrisy"".  How about some
simple honesty?
Why would Mr. Thau make these things up?  It doesn't make much sense, I
know.  Aside from the fact that it's pretty dumb for *anyone* to indulge
in intellectual condescension toward William Buckley, didn't Mr. Thau
realize someone could check his charges?  Did he just get carried away
with, ah, creativity? Generally, if someone is caught faking citations
in a debate, he's immediately disqualified.  Of course, that rule can't
be enforced on the net, but I think people should be aware of the depths
to which some netters are willing to stoop to try to disparage people they
disagree with.
In any case, Mr. Thau owes us all an apology.  An explanation might be
entertaining, but it's unlikely to convince.

Actually, I doubt the insurance companies would go for this.  It only solves
half of the issue (if it even does that).  Suppose, that I (with my seatbelt
discount) go out driving with me belt on and run into (my fault) someone else
who is not wearing their seatbelt.  My policy is still obliged to pay.

So social darwinism rears its ugly head on the net.  I was just reading
something like this earlier today.  Let me see...  here it is:
    Social Darwinists, following the English social theorist Herbert
    Spencer, thought all such regulation unwise.  ""Very many of the
    poorer classes are injured by druggists' prescriptions and quack
    medicines, Spencer willingly conceded.  But there was nothing wrong
    in that; it was the penalty nature attached to ignorance.  If the
    poor died of their own foolishness, the species would improve.""
		   -- Paul Starr, ""The Social Transformation of
		      American Medicine,"" quoted in the Texas Observer
Funny.  I thought that the cruder examples of this sort of thinking had died
out some time ago.  Obviously they haven't (unless our friend was merely
being facetious).
I've got an even better idea -- why not actively discourage the use of
seatbelts with a heavy tax?  If the social darwinists are right, that should
increase not only the world's average intelligence but its average wealth as
well!  :-{

No offense intended, but this is just the kind of thing that makes lawyers
have unassisted orgasms, makes judges commit suicide, makes insurance
company execs give smug little I'll-get-that-extra-Mercedes-this-year-
after-all smiles, and makes your average Joe's wallet look like an
Ethiopian famine victim.
Who is to decide that an accident could have been prevented by wearing a
seatbelt?  If the insurance company doesn't want to pay the injured all
they have to do is start too long, too expensive court battle to wear
the injured, the courts, and the rest of us down.  This area is far too
subjective and nebulous to be put into an arena where it can cause so
much grief.
My solution to seatbelt, helmet, anti-suicide, and other such 'preventative'
laws is simple:  get rid of them.  You're going to tell me that I can't
take a risk that endangers no one but me?  You're going to tell me that
I can't kill myself if I want to?  Rubbish!
By the way, the You in ""You're going to tell me...."" above is not
directed at Peter, just at legislators in general.
They let people hang-glide and water-ski without helmets, don't they?

thing was proposed as an alternative.  It got shot down primarily by
practical considerations--If a non-seat belt user was in an accident, it
was pointed out, all they had to do (assuming they were conscious),
was to quickly buckle up their belts before the dust settled.
Obviously this argument has a few holes, but nobody ever lost money
betting on the lack of intellectual quality of Texas legislators..(-: :-)

While the risks may endanger no-one but you (perhaps), its not true that
they harm no-one but you.  When you are injured, your insurance pays you,
and I pay your insurance company.  You sit in hospital and use the last
bed, so the hospital has to build a new wing, and I pay for it.  You
croak, and use the last cheap plot in the cemetery, so now I have to
buy a more expensive one.  After all this, your ""freedom"" has still
not stopped costing me ...  Now your ex-employer has to employ someone
else, and train them, I pay more for his product.
So, please, if you want to kill yourself, do it in some way that
everyone knows that's what you are doing, and make sure that you
succeed, no insurance, no hospital.  That still doesn't recover
all the costs, but it at least will save some of them.  Remember
that society has an investment in you - you owe us!

on the costs (and causes) of auto fatalities.  It had two parts:
1. an estimate of the total cost to the society as a whole of
   an auto fatality (the cost to the police and hospitals to
   clean up the mess, the cost to the government of not collecting
   in taxes the cost of educating the individual, etc. etc.).
   The average fatality cost about $50,000.  This is paid for

2. a study of every fatality in a specific model year of Volvos
   in Sweden (I think the year was 1975).  The study was done
   jointly by Volvo, the insurance companies, The National
   Traffic Safety Board, and the people who usually reconstruct

As a result of this study, Sweden passed a mandatory seat belt
law.
In addition to protecting you in a crash, a good seat belt will
support you if you have to swerve your car to avoid an accident,
thus preventing accidents as well.

An interesting viewpoint, and I can see your point somewhat, but:
a) You live in New York City (I know you don't, but pretend); there is
   a higher crime rate there, and when you get mugged your insurance
   company pays and I pay your insurance company.  I could give a lot
   more examples, but the basic line is that life (and ESPECIALLY
   insurance) ain't fair.  If you're interested in such things,
   definitely take the time to read _The_Invisible_Bankers_ by
   Andrew Tobias.
b) You hang glide and fly small planes, so you get injured and/or
   killed.  I pay.  Life is a bitch, ain't it?
My basic message here is much more objective than that:  There are
insurance discounts for non-smokers for the reasons that you put
forth above, and I like that because I am a non-smoker.  Am I really
a non-smoker?  Send me to your insurance company's doctor and I
guarantee you he can answer that question reliably unless I work
in a coal mine or in downtown L.A.  Now, do I really wear my
seatbelt all the time?  Who knows but me?

I owe you?  OK, I guess you're right -- I'll do my good deed by
reducing the population, not contributing to the rise in population
at a later date, not consuming anymore food, energy, or space; and
I'll lower the unemployment rate at the same time -- all by suicide!!
Pretty effective little act, isn't it?
As for your earlier point about you paying for this and that, what
about the jobs that I create in the insurance, health care, and
burial industries?  Not to mention the work afforded to florists (assuming
someone likes me enough to send flowers to either the hospital and/or
the funeral), the minister who reads my eulogy, the lawyers who squabble
over my estate, the coroner who does the autopsy... I could go on for
days!!
I think I'll go off myself right now; what a great feeling to be
benefiting others!!

One problem with the above solution is the difficulty in determining
whether or not seat-belts would have an advantageous effect or not.
Also, what happens when I hit someone (my fault) and they didn't have
a seat belt on? Am I less liable because they didn't wear one?
The new trend of mandatory seat-belt laws is so ridiculous! 
My home state of North Carolina is having their law go into 
effect Oct. 1. I am a habitual seat-belt user but I'm almost
ready to not wear them past Oct. 1. I think it's just another
excuse for police to inspect vehicles.
I fully support mandatory child restraint laws, however.
The difference: kids can't responsibly decide whether or
not to wear them and shouldn't be penalized by death for 
having bone-headed parents.

I believe that if a seat belt user is involved in an accident, the selt
belt will stretch enough that investigators can easily tell the selt belt
has been through an accident.
I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.

and non-user) would be a good idea.
It is claimed that it is easy to cheat.  In most accidents it
should be easy to tell.  A significant number of non-users end
up dead.  Others are unconscious.  Some are thrown clear of the
car, or across the car to the other side.  Others would be too
dazed to think of buckling up afterwards.  The nature of the
injuries would often be decisive.  For example, if a person's
forehead is caved in from hitting the dash the force of the
accident would probably cause belt bruises on wearers.
Showering glass particles would probably leave a shadow where
the belt is.  Patterns of blood on clothing and the belt would
indicate a lot to an investigator.
Even if people did successfully cheat some of the time, the
benefit in terms of lowered premiums to belt wearers would still
be sufficient to be desirable.
I am sure the insurance companies have statistics on how much
cost is incurred in paying to people in accidents who are
wearing seatbelts vs. those not wearing.  This would form the
basis for differential premiums, which I think would be rather
large.  Those carrying ""belted"" policies who are injured while
not wearing belts could be paid out at a rate proportional to
the differential.  Policies could be offered with four options:
(1) unbelted driver and passengers, (2) belted passengers,
unbelted driver, (3) belted driver, unbelted passengers, and (4)
belted driver and passengers.  The same differential payouts
could apply, although I think it would be advisable to only
offer two options depending on the driver wearing or not wearing
a belt and pay out for passengers regardless, since a passenger
often would not know what kind of policy the driver carries and
could in any case be purposely mislead by the driver.
The argument that requiring occupants to wear seatbelts
infringes on their freedom is often buttressed by analogy to
risky things like hang-gliding.  While I am less in favour of
seatbelt legislation as time goes by, (especially when choices
can be offered as in insurance options), I would like to refute
the argument.  The analogy is not strictly applicable since it
is impossible to hang-glide without hang-gliding but it is
possible to sit in a moving car wearing seat-belts.
The point that the foolishness of non-users costs all of us has
not been made strongly enough.  By far the greatest cost to
society is the loss of productivity and creativity from the
injured and the dead.  Of course, anyone has the right to be
unproductive and uncreative.
Seatbelts on drivers help them maintain their position at the
controls and therefore lessen the chance that they will lose
control after primary collisions or unforeseen gyrations (i.e.
skids).  Thus they lessen the chance that they will hit oncoming
traffic or pedestrians thereby injuring or killing innocent
bystanders.","BqLiEtCGqQgJ",1,1985-07-30,1,0

        I'm not to sure about that,  but  wouldn't  the  injuries  the
        person  wearing  the  seatbelt be identifibly different from a
        person who was  not  wearing  a  seatbelt?  In  a  high  speed
        collision I would think a person wearing a seatbelt would have
        bruises across the waist and  chest  where  the  straps  were.
        Also  a  person  wearing  a seatbelt would be unlikely to have
        suffered head injuries.
        Overall the idea of not paying off accident victim who weren't
        wearing  seatbelts  doesn't  strike  me as very practical.  It
        would be nice if people who  wore  their  seatbelts  regularly

This is true. If fact, If you are in a moderately severe accident it is
recommended (at least by consumer reports) that you replace your seatbelts
because they cannot absorb a second shock as well and could possibly fail.

From experience, I can testify that this is true. It's surprising the kind of
evidence that a trained investigator can find. 
I had an accident where I was rear-ended by a car massing more than twice
mine, traveling about 35-50 MPH upon impact. I had my left-turn signal going
(and my brakes on -OUCH!-), which was verified by the particular way the
remnants of the bulb's filaments deposited themselves upon the remnants of
the bulb!
Anyway, why couldn't the insurance company simply nullify the policy if
the owner of the policy sustained injuries that wouldn't occur if he had
been wearing his belt? (I know, this merely narrows the margin where it
is questionable, yet it becomes pretty small.) I dislike paying higher
premiums because other people don't wear their belts.

    They don't even need to *try* to verify which of their customers actually
wears their seat belts.  All they'd have to do is to offer two types of
insurance: seat-belted and non-seatbelted.  The only difference would be that
seat-belted would cost less, and wouldn't pay for injuries caused by not
wearing seat belts.  As <someone> above points out, there should be big
differences in the types of injuries which occur so that a non-belted
driver using belted insurance wouldn't be able to fool anyone by putting the
belt on after the accident.

Points are well taken.  Being basically a libertarian by nature, I had
thought of the insurance non-payment plan as an alternative to the intrusive
nature of a seat belt law, but couldn't come up with a counter to the
""buckling up"" after the fact argument.
However, it does seem that from a legislative point of view, a variation
on the original argrument could be used.  Might not litigants argue that
they really did have their seat belts on, but the accident wasn't severe
enough to stretch them?  This is all promising, but I think we need
more information, and possibly a body of case law, to convince legislators...

Okay Bob, since I have a financial interest in your attitudes
and lifestyle, I expect to be able to influence your attitudes
and your lifestyle. Please submit to me (address below) a detailed
account of your personal habits. Please include such information
as:
	1. Eating habits (I don't want you to eat foods that
	   could give you health problems I would pay for.)
	2. Drinking and smoking behaviors (I won't pay for
	   your liver problems or lung cancer treatment.)
	3. Hobbies (No hang-gliding, white-water canoeing, etc...)
	4. Sexual behaviors (I want all your potential partners
	   to be certified AIDS and herpes free.)
I'm sure I have missed many relevant aspects of your life that
could cause me finacial distress. Once I have discussed these with
my fellow-society members, we will submit to you new life-style guidelines
that you will be forced to adhere to under penalty of law.

If the accident wasn't severe enough to stretch the seat belts,
then the medical damages ought to be very low.
If litigant's face is broken from hitting the windshield, even a jury is
unlikely to believe the seat belt was actually used. (where seat belt
means combination lap/shoulder belt)

In some states you are.  California used to be one, but I'm not sure if  it
still  is.  The  concept  involved  is  ""contributory negligence"".  If they

VILLAGE  VOICE  article written by Roger Wilkens.  The next day I
was to attend the benefit 'Comic Relief' sponsored  by  the  AIDS
Medical  Foundation  here  in New York.  I was thinking about how
what Roger Wilkens said affected me not just as a black  man  but
as a gay man.
After the show there was a party held for large  contributors  at
the  Harvard  Club.   I  spoke  with  many people there about the
challenge  that  AIDS  represents;  not  just  to   the   medical
establishment,  but  to  the   education   establishment.   About
the challenge AIDS represents; not just to the gay community, but
to  the  community  at-large.   I thought about the importance of
educating  our young to  remember the hardships of  others,  what
they  went  through,  what  they endured.  This, obviously, means
different things to different people.   But,  Wilkens  was  right
about  the  importance of being strong.  Not just for minorities,
but for all of us.  We must each  be  strong  in  addressing  and
dealing  with  the hardships that many of us now endure.  We must
be thoughtful in our approach and sympathetic.   We  must  reject
illogic and emotional reaction; stupidity and hatred.
Those who attack affirmative action, those who wish to ignore the
needs  of  the  under-privileged, those who might suggest that we
forget the Holocaust, or  earlier  holocausts  committed  by  men
against  men,  ignore  the  lesson  to  be  learned  through  the
collective human experience.
Some mornings when I get on the subways to go to work, and  we're
all  pressed  into  those  train  cars  elbow to elbow, breast to
breast, it seems there is always someone who reacts negatively to
the  situation.   You  hear,  'Bitch!  Don't touch me!'  You hear
moanings and groanings, complaints,  accusations.   We  must  all
remember  that we're in this together.  We created the situations
and must now endure them or do what we can to change  them;  each
and every one of us.
Understanding and thoughtfulness are  among  the  most  important
virtues  we  can  possess.   We must all use these virtues to the
best of our ability, we must all try to 'count to ten,' weigh our
words, and understand.

died last night.  I'm not much on eulogizing, or breast-beating, but I
always felt that this country was extremely lucky to have had Erwin where he
was during the 1970's.  I was living in DC during that period, and it was a
relief to know that we had a *statesman* overlooking the Watergate hearings;
we've had damn few of them lately.  And it seemed, from third-party
information we are provided by the media, that he was a good man.  Enough
said.
On reading further into the Seattle Times obituary, I began to examine the
various praises and eulogies of those in the political arena.  One
statement, however, stopped me dead in my tracks, and has raised my blood
pressure several points.  Jesse Helms, one of the few politcos I would truly
term narrow-minded and cruel, was quoted as saying that Ervin was his
""mentor"".
Mentor.  I take this to mean that Jesse's views and ideals were shaped by
the late Senator.  That his political code of ethics were patterned after
his colleague.  That his behavior in public reflected the high standards
Ervin was famous for.
As Bill Cosby would say, ""RIIIIIIIGHT!""
I find it difficult to stomach the allegation that a man who refers to the
AIDS epidemic among the homosexual community as a deserved plague from God,
feels that nuclear war is winnable, and alleges that we don't have enough
money to feed the poor but subsidies for the tobacco industry are essential,
got his guiding principles from one of the few role models to come out of
American politics in the last few years.  It's a parting insult to Ervin's
memory, and a fairly obvious political sucking-up, but what can you expect
from such despicable human garbage?
If Helms is going to name mentors, I suggest that he proposes people a
little closer to his point-of-view and personality, like Jerry Falwell.  Or
Adolph Eichmann.

(What should I call the latter?  Liberals?) I think each side is in need
of a better understanding of the other.  (Whether they want it is another
question.)  I think it's foolish and narrow minded to blame either side
for all the evil in the world or for wanting to take over the country
and run things their way.  Each side pits its followers agianst the other
in real ""true believer"" fashion.  Having a ""devil"" to blame the worlds ills
on is a convenient way of stirring up fanatical support for their cause.
I think each ""side"" is to blame for many problems and each has done some
good.  I for one am not afraid to support the MM where I think they are
right as well a oppose them where they are wrong.  Same goes for the other
groups.  
IN MY OPINION:
I think that the Moral Majority's use of power bloc politics is out of
character for a group supposedly based on Christian principles.  Above
that, they are sure God agrees with them on every point.  Fallwell's
proclaimation of AIDS as being God's judgement of homosexuals is totally
unfounded.  (With the same reasoning, I guess you could say that Liberals
are God's judgment against the MM ;-) ).  Also, his fund raising tactics
sicken me.  There's no excuse for it.  Though I disagree strongly with
many of the MM's beliefs and practices, I find no reason to condemn them
as an organization.  No more reason, that is, than I have to condemn People
for the American Way (Who's president is also a Baptist minister BTW) as
an organization.  To support one only because they are in opposition to
the other is foolishness.  People should learn how to think rather than
be told what to think.  That takes listening to both sides--effort which
few people are willing to take.
I don't think that people should condemn the MM's involvement in politics
before they realize that the groups they oppose are doing the same thing
(and using the same methods) with their ideas.  And I think the news media
definitely biases itself against the MM.  If you think that all Christians
who see an application of biblical principles for society are ""Falwellites""
think again.  Political involvement works both ways.  Everyone in our
society has the right to influence it with whatever principles they think
are right.  And I think they should be able to do so on par with others.
To label one group as ""dangerous"" and target them for suppression is 
committing a wrong far worse than any wrong ideas the opposing group might
have.
Speaking of book burning and censorship, Liberals have been praciticing it
for years under the guise of ""instilling proper values in our children"" and
""removing stereotypes and religious influences"".  Cal Thomas, Falwell's
right-hand-man (who seems to have a bit more common sense than Jerry) has
written a book called ""Book Burning"".  If anyone really wants to have
an understanding of the conflict that the MM sees themselves in, I suggest
you read it.  I expected this book to be an emotional tirade against Liberalism
but Thomas has made a good attempt at being reasonable and fair.  So before
you call *them* ""book burners"" read ""Book Burning"".  You're arguing from
ignorance, otherwise.  One thing the book documents it the exclusion of 
Christian authored books from major bookstore chains and ""best seller's
lists"".  In response to this B. Dalton's has stocked up on many of the
best selling books.  I was impressed.  They expanded their inventory and
moved the ""religious"" section from the back to the middle of the store.
They even buy advertising regularly in ""Christianity Today"".  I'm sure
B. Dalton stands to make a lot of money by breaking into this lucrative
market.  But still... B. Dalton .....  My hat is off.
An example of Liberal intolerance would be the 'welcome' Fallwell received
when he spoke at Harvard last year.  Contrast that with the warm reception
that Ted Kennedy received at Liberty Baptist College a few months later.
It seems that cat calls and jeers at Jerry Falwell are justified because
""Falwell is wrong and Liberals are right"".  But I'd bet if Kennedy had
been treated the same way at LBC we all would have read about it in the
news as an example of ""bigoted fundamentalist fanaticism"".

a reasonable exercise of freedom of religion.  And almost any political

have an attempt to set public policy on religious grounds -- and that's
one of the evil effects of a state-sponsored religion.  Not only that,

the stereotypes.   One of them is that those who oppose the
(im)Moral(not)Majorty are liberals.  I've lambasted the MM
several times on this net, usually in detail, and for
specific actions that represent the abridgement of freedoms
or the substitution of religious for legal principles.
None the less, I suspect that few net readers will accuse me of being
a ""flaming liberal"".   (Well?  Do any of you? :-)
I object violently to stereotypes for several reasons.  The most
fundamental are ethical, but since ethics never afflicted most
of the net, (NOT you, Paul, you are at least consistant, and
you argue, as opposed to shout, shame I can't mail to you...)
let me point out a reason that involves mere self-interest:
	When the Grenadian liberation (yeah, I'm going to use
revolutionary terminology)  was aided by the U.S. government,
I was probably the foremost supporter of that invasion on this
net.  I was labelled as an ""unrepentitant conservative"", and there
was a long debate about whether or not conservatives should
be considered human, with lots of accusations flying back and
forth accusing either me or the other side <that was about how it
felt> of stupidity, moral terpitude, and many other things.  
Several people faked cancellation messages for my articles
in order to shut me up, and we considered linking my mailbox to
/dev/null for a week to keep the deliberate mail misusers
from crashing rabbit by filling up our spool filesystem.
The upshot of this damnfool discussion was the use of
""rabbit!jj"" as an example of the worst example of a net user for
about six months or so.  <This attitude did, in fact, get back
to my management, who complained to me. I hope you bloody censors
out there are satisfied, Tim (not M., for heavens sake!).>
Well.  Now I've been sucked into the abortion debate.  Again,
I'm using EXACTLY the same ethical basis, (defense of personal
freedom)  but NOW I'm the ""damned satanic communist liberal"" 
who ""would eat dead babies for breakfast"". <You should see my 
BAD mail...> Hell!  Now, I'm a liberal of the most extreme bent.
Will you all make up your minds???  I didn't even know
that teddy bears were active in politics.  :-)
The next time that you use a stereotype, try to remember that
the victim of your stereotype is probably a thinking being who
will both be hurt by, and resent, your prejudice.

Oops, I think that one was muddy too!  It may have been a slip, but there
are an awful lot of ""anti-falwellites"" who would be gravely insulted to be
called ""liberals""...in fact, opposition to Falwell comes from a remarkably
widespread base.

I disagree strongly.  I will condemn anyone for using immoral or unethical
tactics to gain his ends.  If both the MM and their opponents are playing
dirty politics to get their own selfish ways, they are both wrong and I am
against both.  Ends DO NOT justify means.  (Looking at it from the other
side, I won't condemn Christianity just because the MM behaves scandalously
and claims to be a Christian organization.  Their behavior drags them down
but need not take all of Christianity with it.)
I believe that the reason that the MM is so often blasted for their actions
is that they claim to be a Christian organization, yet they don't seem to
show the alleged Christian traits of forgiveness, tolerance, kindness, etc.
If I saw Falwell's behavior in an avowed politician, I would regard it as
characteristic of underhanded, scurrilous politics - which seems to be the
way politics is conducted, as often as not.  But Falwell alleges himself to
be operating not so much as a politician but as a Christian leader.  Hence
I must regard him as not only scurrilous but hypocritical.  That's why he
gets more than his ""fair share"" of abuse from other camps.

In my book, the catcalls and jeers would be wrong in either direction...but
I suppose that in each case the audience treated the speaker with the same
regard that they have come to expect from the speaker.  That is, while
Kennedy has no use for the reactionary Protestant fundamentalists, at least
he can keep a civil tongue in his head most of the time.  Falwell, on the
other hand, would be happy to drive the liberals from the face of the earth
straight through the gates of hell if he had the power - and he was greeted
with corresponding respect.

Consider the articles a few weeks ago by the person who was so certain
that a nuclear reactor under construction had to be stopped at all costs.
He felt that because he was RIGHT, he had the right to use force (not violence)
to impose his views.
There are many groups of people who are sure they are right about something,
and only the stupidity/evil of the rest of the world prevents them from
agreeing.  That's not so bad, but the ""logic"" often follows that these
people have the right (or even duty) to impose their views on everyone
else for their own good.
Perhaps some of these fanatics do have truth on their side.  Worse, perhaps
there are good rational arguments, but these arguments are too subtle to
be effectively presented in a public forum.  How do we distinguish
rational fanatics from irrational ones.  How do we distinguish rational
but wrong fanatics from rational but correct ones?  Whose views should
we all accept for our own good?
For my part, I tend to agree with almost everything Jesus proclaimed or

auto-dialed Jerry Falwell's 800 number hundreds of times a day for eight
months. For those who have missed news reports, this is the text of a piece
written for the Washington Post. All facts are current as of Jan. 7. I pass it
along with no comment...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	By the Washington Post
|
|	ATLANTA -- For now, at least, the Rev. Jerry Falwell has exorcised the
Demon Dialer.
|	But an angry computer commando, as a protest against TV evangelists,
vows to keep right on bedeviling the $100 million fund-raising machine of the
Moral Majority (or the Liberty Federation, as Falwell recently announced his
group will be called) with his $200 Atari home computer.
|	``I'll give you a demonstration,'' said Edward Johnson, 46, a
bespectacled computer consultant, pecking away at a keyboard in his
one-bedroom walk-up apartment here.
|	That activates his modem's auto-dailer. Bleep, bleep, bleep goes the
video arcade echo on his speaker phone as his Atari rings up Falwell's world
headquarters in Lynchburg, Va.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says an operator. ``Can I help you?''
|	Johnson grinned. His computer is programmed to tie up the line for 30
seconds, then it hangs up and dials again, as it has every 30 seconds, 24
hours a day, seven days a week, for the last eight months. ``Here we go
again,'' he said, and the computer dials 
1-800-446-5000
.
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' says the operator. ``Help you?'' Click.
|	``You can tell by the tone of voice they're not too happy,'' he said.
|	Indeed, Falwell officials estimate their first high-tech protester
cost them close to $1 million in lost pledges on a blessed WATS line, which
fields some 1 million calls a year, before Southern Bell detectives ordered
Johnson to hang up on Dec. 20 or face criminal charges -- using the telephone
to harass is a federal felony. The besieged switchboard raises at least half
of Falwell's $100 million budget, used to support a TV ministry, missionary
work, Bible study, an anti-abortion crusade and the like.
|	``He has robbed the poor and needy of many thousands of dollars,''
said Falwell in a press released that warned others who would do ``injury to
the cause of Christ by similar illegal acts.''
|	But Johnson accuses TV evangelists of persuading elderly viewers to
part with money they can ill afford to spend, buying religious trinkets and
false hope while the on-the-air preachers use their tax-free status to
subsidize and promote often incendiary views.
|	``They're making millions because there aren't any laws to protect the
gullible from such a powerful medium,'' said Johnson, who says he nearly lost
his family farm to TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggert.
|	After one rip-roaring TV sermon, he said, his 68-year-old mother, Mary
Johnson of Sylvester, was ready to sign over the family's 150 acres in south
Georgia. A virtual shut-in, she lives alone on land his father, who died 12
years ago, once planted with soybeans, peanuts and corn. But Johnston stepped
in and, along with an older brother, Raymond, talked her out of it.
|	``She once bought two Singer sewing machines from different salesmen
in the same week,'' he said.
|	Johnson's crusade began one Sunday morning, April 7, when, he
remembers, Jimmy Swaggert on a local affiliate accused gays of ``spreading
AIDS like flies'' at bathhouses.
|	A political activist and card-carrying member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, Johnson got angry. ``He was implying that you should treat
those people like flies,'' he said. He considered it unfair and inflammatory.
And, of course, he almost lost the farm.
|	He wrote the Federal Communications Commission to complain. He tapped
a second computer to mount a letter-writing campaign to congressmen and
senators. And he dispatched copies of those letters to Falwell, who had his
name. But it would take Falwell eight months to unearth Atari Central.
|	He targeted Falwell because he's the ``most politically active'' TV
evangelist, and his mother had sent him hundreds of dollars. ``If we get
Falwell, Swaggart will fall of his own weight,'' said Johnson, who is single
and lives alone.
|	Weaned on old-time religion growing up in Worth County, Ga., he joined
the Air Force out of high school, worked for a large computer firm as an
engineer, then settled into consulting.
|	He has nothing against religion, he says, but he compares his beliefs
more to Spinoza and Einstein than to fundamentalist TV preachers.
|	But what better way to protest than slow down their collection plate,
he argues. So he began dialing 1-800 ...
|	``Old-Time Gospel Hour,'' said the operator. ``Tap the phone if you
can hear me, honey. We'll pray for you.''
|	``At first,'' said Johnson, ``they thought I was deaf.''
|	For a time, he tried debating the operators to keep them busy. ``But
it was always, `God bless you,' or `God loves you.' They were so sweet, I kind
of felt sorry for them. They were programmed to be nice.''
|	So it was back to the computer. ``A computer is totally impersonal,''
he said. ``It can't feel sorry for you. It's relentless. It shows no mercy.''
|	Toward the end, operators were answering the dead lines: ``Edward
Johnson, is that you?''
|	They stopped thinking the caller was deaf.
|	``My computer kept the pressure on,'' he said. ``It had a great
demoralizing effect.''
|	On Nov. 15, Falwell officials reported trouble on the line. ``They
came to us with a simple technical problem,'' recalled Wayne Jackson, an AT&T
spokesman. ``They were getting hangups and lines jammed.''
|	Technicians ruled out a glitch and put on a tracer. It was touchy
going. Johnson's Atari was programmed to dial and hang up fast, to avoid
leaving fingerprints. But AT&T got its man.
|	On Dec. 17 ``we figured out it was coming from 404 area code,'' said
Jackson, and officials in Atlanta were alerted. Three days later, Southern
Bell security took over and Johnson was identified as the high priest of the
first church of Atari protest.

I've fallen into this class.  It's a grey area as to what is harassing,
but it is almost certain that if someone tells you that you are harassing
them, and you continue to do it, that you are harassing them.

As I stated in my previous article, much of the unhappiness of gay people,
evident in the above symptoms, is due to the oppression we suffer rather
than being intimately connected to homosexuality.  As for how I can live
""this way"", I cannot live any other way than gay.  ""Why?"" you ask, so that
the gay people who come after me don't have to suffer such shit.  Finally,
a sample size of ""20 or so"" is a very small sample to base such a judgement
on out of the 30,000,000 or so homosexuals in the United States... obviously
most of the homosexuals that you have met didn't trust you enough to mention
it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	It is very true that homosexuals are oppressed, but let's not
exaggerate this. Most of those I have known were hardly 'oppressed'
compared to many other groups in our society; they were often very successful
nevertheless unhappy. You are blaming somewhat their personal dissatisfaction
upon the larger society, which simply does disagree about the morality of this,
even though it is fairly tolerant. I am saying you are not very objective.
The fact is that a lot of their psychological problems are caused by the same
unconscious motives which cause many of them to be promiscuous. Many are 
slaves to their own promiscuous sexuality, which cannot make them emotionally
secure.
	Besides this, I have heard a number of experts in public health,
concerned with the AIDS infection, observe that the physical health of 
homosexuals as a group is not very good because of their transient lifestyles,
and very high rate of infection of all kinds of diseases, which is due to
promiscuity. Contradict them, but I accept their opinion as specialists
who objectively know as much as anyone.
	You are probably right that my experience is limited. However, I
am interested in people, and they do talk to me in a way that they might
not to others. I met very few of these at parties (You or Dave Trisell
remarked on this.); I met them either when I worked as a laborer, or
as a university student or researcher, or I met them at church, or at
political events, or they were neighbors. They were pretty ordinary.

You forget that 15% of *all* men are gay or bisexual, actually I doubt you
forget, but wish to conviently brush the facts aside.  You are right about
the fact that many non-gays recommend against a gay lifestyle, *mostly due
to Christian spread intolerence* however.  I don't even recommend it, if one
can be straight, one may save ones life, job, home and health by not being
gay and thereby incurring the wrath of bigots.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I did not mention your percentages, because my point was that
homosexuality is not accepted among other very large non-Christian cultures,
which are far more sexually repressive than this ""Christian"" culture.
Listen, I am handicapped; I know what is prejudice, probably better than
you, because my handicap is obvious. But I am careful not to label people
who disagree with me, but would not harm me. I don't even dislike you
a little bit. But I disagree.

15% of all male children will grow up to be gay/bisexual.  Is it healthy
to teach children that the life they will lead is somehow sick, evil, etc?
No.  Isn't this a method of making sure that they will have problems for the
rest of their lives?  Yes.  Will it change their orientation to tell them
such things?  No.  Will some of the larger percentage of children that
aren't gay take these concepts about gays and use them to justify going
out and ""bashing queers"" and otherwise denying gays human rights.  Yes.
Do you wish to continue the cycle?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You have posed a dilemma which does not exist, as I see it.
It is my opinion that the genetic basis for homosexuality must be very
weak, since homosexuals will not reproduce relatively often (nothing like 15%).
This suggests to me that the initial determination of homosexuality is very 
much socially 'circumstantial', but that it is quickly 'imprinted' by the very
powerful sexual drive. (I notice you do not quote Masters and Johnson, who
have no bias, but found that sexual response is conditioned, but sometimes
reversible even among adults. This caused them a lot of very abusive political
trouble.) I am not suggesting that homosexuality is determined by simple
social 'circumstances', of family or otherwise. But you should appreciate how
little we are really informed of the consequences of childhood relationships; 
for example, a very large percentage of rapists and postitutes have unsatis-
factory childhood relationships. My point is that these circumstances are
often very far from satisfying to those involved, and they have consequences.
	If people had more stable, loving families, in which the love of
the parents for each other was manifest, I doubt that there would be even
a small fraction of what you suggest.
	As I've repeatedly said, anyone who persecutes anyone is not a
Christian, by the simple definition that Christ did not condemn anyone.

Perhaps the Christians who used it that way were enlightened.  Some
Christians today are enlightened, but certainly you are not one of those.
Quit trying to use some obscure definition of the word enlighten as
*the* definition.  What enlightened me, by the way, was having to
live with prejedice every day of my life.  Since one of the major
teachings of JC that I still believe and use in my own religious/moral
code, is that you should love your neighbor as yourself.  Since I do
not like prejedice against myself, I assume that my neighbor doesn't
either.  Therefore, I try to enlighten others, like you, who are in
need of enlightenment.

	Perhaps I should not have said anything about this, but it is
you who was first talking about who is or is not 'enlightened' (even in the
conclusion of the previous article to which this reply was made). I was
pointing out that you may not be baptized in Christ, and that this is
true 'enlightenment', no matter what you think. And as Jesus said,
""Everyone who sins, is a slave to sin."" But this should make us more
merciful.
	If you love your neighbor as yourself, then you are not far from
being a Christian. But I disagree about the matter at hand. But again I
also agree that there are good Christians who do not believe that
homosexuality is a sin. (but it is not this opinion which makes them
good Christians; it is the fact of their helpfulness, and unwillingness
to see anyone harmed.) I might add, though, that most of these privately
would prefer that no one was homosexual.
	I agree that we all have a lot to learn.

Stoning was only done for a very few and specific acts.  As far as I have
been able to determine homosexuality was not one of these.  If you have
other information please define its source (chapter and verse of the
Bible will be sufficient).  By all of the studies, 6% to 15% of all men
are homosexual *irreguardless of race, religion, or time in history*.
Thus your above arguement is bogus horseshit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	(I definitely do not agree with punishment of homosexuals; I am
rebutting your contention about Jewish law; I have consulted an Orthodox
friend who is a rabbinical student.) Translation from NEB.
	Lev.18.22. You shall not lie with a man as with a woman: that is
an abomination (an expression for a most grave sin).
	Lev.18.29,30. for anyone who does any of these abominable things
shall be cut off from his people. Observe the charge, therefore, and follow
none of the abominable institutions customary before your time.
	Lev.20.13. If a man has intercourse with a man as with a woman, they
both commit an abomination. They shall be put to death; their blood shall be
on their own hands.
	There are four punishments by death, according to the offense: stoning
to death is considered to be the least severe.
	You should consult an Orthodox authority concerning the interpretation
of Jewish Law, if you want to understand their tradition.
	I did not say what you would have, but said ""it is very probable that
Jesus never came across a persecuted homosexual Jew, there were so few.""
I said nothing about estimates of proportions of homosexuals in various
cultures; besides, this is very speculative. What I said is that it was
considered to be an 'abomination' among the Jews, punishable by death. Jesus
was very probably a public figure for one year (and no more than three years);
as I said, in this repressive society, Jesus very well might not have met
a public example of 'a persecuted homosexual Jew' during his ministry. Recall
that disciples who knew about his ministry wrote the Gospels; he did not
write anything himself. They do report the account of the adulterous woman,
which gives his attitude toward both sexual sins and toward the Law: he
reminds us that we have all sinned; he does not condemn her; he tells her
to stop sinning. That is, he rejects the mercilessness of the old law, and
the hypocrisy of those who would condemn others with punishment.
	(I have never met 'a persecuted homosexual', as such, even in this
fairly open society. I've seen them on television, but I've never met one.
I have demonstrated in Austin, Texas against proposals of housing laws 
which discriminate against homosexuals. There was no TV in Jesus day, his
society was repressive, and he seems to be very busy with those who sought
him out or whom he encountered.)
	As for your contentions about modern foreign cultures, you seem to
be very uninformed by their members. I work in a research institute in which
we have literally dozens of visitors every year from all over the world:
China, Taiwan, India, Australia, Italy, Israel, East Germany, Finland,
Japan, France, Iran, from all over the world. I have been informed that
homosexuality is very uncommon and unaccepted among the very largest cultures.
You may say that is because they are repressive, so that homosexuals do not
disclose themselves publicly, but that is not my point: it is not publicly
common or even privately accepted in these cultures. It is here and in some
more tolerant countries. But their 'repressiveness' has nothing to do with
Christianity, and you are denigrating their cultural values if you insist
upon this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>	As for his other attitudes about sexuality, they are very clear.
>First, he says marriage may interfere with ministry, but does not insist
You seem to be confusing Jesus and Paul (Saul) here.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Of course not. 
	Paul does make some recommendations. But read Matthew where Jesus
says some are celibate for the sake of the kingdom of God, but he does not
insist upon this. (see a commentary) By the way, apparently the contemporary
Essene monks were celibate, while the Pharisaic rabbis were married of course.
But this, as well as his own unmarried state, may have prompted this exchange.
(The Essenes were extremely ascetic and pious; however this may be, they were
not merciful to sinners, and their ethical teachings were not like those of
Jesus.)

I've never been married to a woman.  Does this mean that I shouldn't break
up with my lover of five years.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Of course not; do you reason like this all the time? He presupposes
the divine provision of heterosexual mating, period. There is no provision
for homosexuality at all; this would undermine the sanctity of the other.

Perhaps the Christians who used it that way were enlightened.  Some
Christians today are enlightened, but certainly you are not one of those.
Quit trying to use some obscure definition of the word enlighten as
*the* definition.  What enlightened me, by the way, was having to
live with prejedice every day of my life.  Since one of the major
teachings of JC that I still believe and use in my own religious/moral
code, is that you should love your neighbor as yourself.  Since I do
not like prejedice against myself, I assume that my neighbor doesn't
either.  Therefore, I try to enlighten others, like you, who are in
need of enlightenment.

JC never mentions homosexuals in any context.  Paul, however, was not
a freethinker in any respect, and followed the Jewish legal tradition
quite strongly.  He may have been adding some these sorts of personal
prejudgements to his discourses (on totally different subjects).  That
is why such prejudgements need to reexamined periodically.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i. Paul's 'personal prejudgments' were, rather, traditional.
ii. It is 'personal prejudgment' to have Paul say what he plainly
	does not.
iii. Paul was 'freethinking' for his time, but this does not mean
	he would agree with anything we would like. Although he was
	formerly the student of a famous Pharisaic teacher, his
	understanding of Scripture and human psychology is remarkably
	'modern'; certainly his interpretations of Scripture are very
	figurative, instead of simply literal. Also, he did set aside
	many rules of traditional Jewish ritual Law, which he believed
	were less important ethically and theologically, which might
	cause non-Jews to stumble, so that they might listen to the
	Gospel. Finally, Paul said that while Christians had been
	set free by Christ, still not all things were good for them.
iii. Jesus cites Scripture that man and woman were created by God
	for each other. This is the traditional Jewish view, which one
	can misconstrue only if one is very obstinate.
iv. Jesus was not condemnatory of any sins, but merciful, so that
	all men, being sinners, might come to repentance. It is
	mercifulness, rather than vengeance, which leaves open the
	possibility of repentance. Vengeance hardens our hearts.
v. The primary point is that if Jesus had approved, even privately,
	of homosexuality, no matter what is recorded in the NT
	writings, this would have been so scandalous to the
	contemporary Jewish society, notably to the religious leaders,
	that we would certainly be informed about it according to
	orthodox Jewish tradition. I stand on this.
vi. I should say that my purpose in making these observations is
	to make clear that no one can plausibly suggest that Jesus,
	or Paul, approved of homosexuality. However, Jesus certainly
	did not persecute anyone. And those who do are not like him.
vii. Faith is said to be a gift of God, but for those who would
	desire it. Jesus could only heal the spiritual afflictions
	of those who sought his help, who would desire faith, as in
	the saying, ""Lord, help my unbelief,"" and the ultimate
	petition of Mass, based on the faithful petition even of a
	Gentile centurion, ""Lord, I am not worthy to recieve you, but
	only say the word, and I shall be healed.""
viii. I believe that the churches should help to secure the human rights
	of all individuals, including rights to assembly, speech, religion,
	voting, employment, and housing. I believe that homosexuals should 
	not be excluded from congregations, anymore than are sexually
	promiscuous persons. And although they may elect to exclude them-
	by a sort of self-excommunication, the consequences of enforced
	separation may be harmful to someone who would otherwise change
	in the course of time and fellowship. We should be patient, rather
	than condemnatory; by excluding or persecuting others, we are
	condemning them, since therefore they cannot not come to change.
viii.Most Christians simply believe that God has created mankind with the
	intention of heterosexuality; one may not believe in the divine
	creation, but our anatomy and reproduction alone suggest very strongly
	that evolution has selected for phenotypic heterosexuality -- other-
	wise we would suffer self-extinction very quickly. For someone who
	does believe in creation by God, he must also faithfully believe 
	that the means of this creation, including our heterosexual
	reproduction, is good, even if we cannot forsee yet what is the 
	fulfillment of creation. My point is that a religious view of nature 
	is religious, and not purely existential as if the only purposes
	were our own.
ix. I believe that you must surely understand what I've said, even if 
	you disagree with my views, or with those of Jesus or Paul, so 
	that there is no reason to falsely characterize what I have said.
	What I object to is a view which misrepresents the ethical teachings
	of the NT for the sake of a prejudice, and furthermore expects that
	the churches should approve of behavior which is considered to be
	a sin according to Christian as well as precedent Jewish tradition.

I question the use of most in the above paragraph.  Do you mean most
Christians?  If so, while potentially true, this is the very point
that we are pushing to have reexamined.  Do you mean most cultures?
This is not true.  Do you mean most people today?  This is the work
of the Christian Church, and demonstrates why this belief must be
changed.  As for homosexuality being self-destructive, that is an
opinion you seem to hold that has no justifications here.  Prove it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As you already first observe, and as the context suggests,
""most"" means ""most of the living body of Christians.""
	Do I have to prove this to you? Do you yourself want to live
as a large proportion of homosexuals do?
	I am simply giving my opinion based on discussion with homosexual
individuals, 20 or so, over 20 years, also based on listening to televised
discussions by physicians who are said to be expert. My impression is
that the rates of suicide, drug abuse, promiscuity, transience, infection,
and death are considerably higher among this population than among non-
homosexual groups, especially married persons. Certainly, the health and
happiness of those with whom I talked was not good, even according to them.
The thing I always wondered was -- how can you live this way? And why?
	If you do not believe me, then ask your doctor to recommend 
unbiased physicians at a medical school who are expert in public health.
Then report this survey to the Net.
	You should understand that nearly everyone who is not homosexual,
not matter how liberal or religious, recommends against this life. Further-
more, as I have been informed by Indian and Chinese friends, who are from
ancient countries representing 1/3 of world population, homosexuality is
not accepted, and rare among these comparatively restrictive cultures. 
Neither do Muslim nations, who represent another very large proportion, 
accept this. All these tradtionally reject it. One has to go back to 
pagan Greek and Roman days to find such widespread acceptance. You are
very mistaken.

You seem to believe that all or most gays live their lives in bathhouses,
and I have to say that that belief is completely incorrect.  Unless
you had friends and/or aquaintances who were openly gay, your big city
experiences with gays have been confined to people who were out partying.
Isn't making a judgement on such a skewed sample a little brash?  I mean,
I'm involved in a relationship that has been ongoing for 4 1/2 years.
I supported my lover through school.  Many gays are actively involved
in charity efforts, upgrading their neighborhoods, politicing for
minority rights, etc.; are these self-destrutive?  I know lots of
gays in stable relationships (just to point out that I am not a strange
exception).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I said what I meant: here I am addressing the general problem of 
promiscuity, whether it is heterosexual or homosexual. Of course, I am
not commenting on where you can find it.
	Like you also, I believe that all of us are capable of doing good,
and of responding to the needs of others. But we do this because we
are human with conscience, not because we are gay or not, perfect or
not. You are saying that gays are human beings capable of good, and I
completely agree that none of us should forget this.
	If you and your friends are not 'promiscuous', then are you really
representative of most homosexuals?
	We all want to have secure relationships with others; the question
is -- what sort of relationship are we securing? Is it to be recommended
to young people? Whether or not it is 'voluntary', is it to be recommended?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While I do not contend that all gays are of benefit to their communities,
I do contend that statements such as those in the above paragraph are at
best unsubstantiated dreck, and are more likely to be considered
rabble-rousing and hate mongering.  Because while you claim to be so
enlightened as to not persecute gays, it is a short step from ""they
are self-destructive"" to ""we must protect them from themselves so
that they can be saved"" to ""put gay people in concentration camps so
that they don't infect our children"" by people not as enlightened as
you claim to be.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	There are two points made in my article, one about Christian 
tradition, the other about my opinion. You dislike my opinion, which
is that homosexuality is self-destructive, that it should not be
approved by the churches, but that no one should persecute anyone,
but treat everyone as an individual who has fallen short, but is
capable of change for the better.
	I've found good qualities in almost everyone, but I would
certainly not recommend everyone's life to others.
	I am not speaking to rabble -- I am speaking to you, without
compromise but also without aspersion. Those who would persecute
others will find no encouragement in what I say, unless they would
distort what I've said. We should always keep in mind what Jesus
said about the adulterer: consider that you who would condemn
this one are also sinners; I have not condemned this one; the one
should stop sinning. This was the new, more merciful commandment
which, it is said, he stooped to write on the earth with his
finger, even as it is said that the Lord God descended at Sinai to
write with His finger on the stone tablets of men's hearts.
	Being homosexual as you are, also does not make you very
'enlightened' I'm afraid. Besides this, it almost certainly does not
mean the same thing to you as it does to me. To begin with, it is
said that the life of Christ is the light of mankind. How many are
living as he did? Also, as you may not know, the Greek word for
'enlightenment' was, in very early Christian writings, used to
refer to baptism, in the sense of the experience at conversion,
or initiation. (It was also similarly used by the pre-Christian 
Essene Jews at Qumran.) What is your initiation? What has set you
on your way?  But my point is that the expression 'enlightenment'
has a specific religious meaning, which you do not appreciate, and
is generally confused with a quality of opinion.","z1jNJIRnbCUJ",18,1985-04-01,10,11

As I stated in my previous article, much of the unhappiness of gay people,
evident in the above symptoms, is due to the oppression we suffer rather
than being intimately connected to homosexuality.  As for how I can live
""this way"", I cannot live any other way than gay.  ""Why?"" you ask, so that
the gay people who come after me don't have to suffer such shit.  Finally,
a sample size of ""20 or so"" is a very small sample to base such a judgement
on out of the 30,000,000 or so homosexuals in the United States... obviously
most of the homosexuals that you have met didn't trust you enough to mention
it.

You forget that 15% of *all* men are gay or bisexual, actually I doubt you
forget, but wish to conviently brush the facts aside.  You are right about
the fact that many non-gays recommend against a gay lifestyle, *mostly due
to Christian spread intolerence* however.  I don't even recommend it, if one
can be straight, one may save ones life, job, home and health by not being
gay and thereby incurring the wrath of bigots.

15% of all male children will grow up to be gay/bisexual.  Is it healthy
to teach children that the life they will lead is somehow sick, evil, etc?
No.  Isn't this a method of making sure that they will have problems for the
rest of their lives?  Yes.  Will it change their orientation to tell them
such things?  No.  Will some of the larger percentage of children that
aren't gay take these concepts about gays and use them to justify going
out and ""bashing queers"" and otherwise denying gays human rights.  Yes.
Do you wish to continue the cycle?

It's most likely a viral infection, spread by a variety of mechanisms
including sexual contact.  Although the gay community has had a higher
incidence of it to date, cases have been reported among heterosexual
partners of infected individuals.  This in turn raises the likelihood
of eventual spread to the population as a whole, with incidence patterns
similar to other sexually transmitted diseases.

Thank you.  But please be even more specific, quoting the recommendations
verbatum so that those of us who want to may respond to the report rather 
than to a mixture of their suggestions and your suggestions.  Since most 
of us don't have the report *yet*, you can facilitate non-flame discussion 
by posting this.
Some of what you present in this posting (ie closing loopholes re pedophiles) 
is reasonable enough to discuss in terms of how it can be implemented without 
undesirable side-effects (such as accidentally outlawing family-oriented 
nudist magazines by defining child-pornography too broadly, as one proposed 
law would have done).

Not sure I caught that, could you also please include (briefly) how the
*Miller* standard differs from the unprosecutable *Roth* standard.  Just
so we know what is being recommended.  (If you said earlier, I forgot it).

In case it isn't obvious, my request is for quotes of the *action* 
recommendations, as calls for more study are not contoversial.  
References to studies, page numbers, etc, will be a good idea later,

At the present time, I believe that only adults over 18 can legally appear in
a porn film.  I always thought this was because we assume that someone of that
age is mature enough to take responsibility for their actions.  If that is not
true, then we have other, much larger problems.  When someone believes in their
convictions and is honest about themselves up front, there are no ""skeletons in 
the closet"" that can be dragged out later, and hence no embarrassments.

In more than one of the ""skin"" magazines I have read, there are write-in sec-
tions that DO answer questions, address disease protection and so forth, dispel-
ling myths and performing a definite educational function.  Some of the most
comprehensive articles about ""safe sex"" (regarding AIDS) that I have seen ap-
peared in Hustler magazine.  I guess that those type of magazines are the only
forum where sexual situations can be discussed in *frank terms*.

This is not what I think of when I think of pornography.  I have not been ex-
posed to this type of material, although I'm sure it exists for those willing
to spend the effort to find it.  This seems to be a good place to reiterate my
request to help break the connection between sex and violence.  One way to aid
this campaign is to not use the two terms together.  Try to replace the stan-
dard phrase ""sex AND violence"", with ""sex OR violence"" wherever possible.  It

Anyway, I do have a question about the original posting.
What's the criterion that's used for distinguishing between
'possibly safe' and 'safe' acts? Are 'possibly safe' acts
ones that have not caused any known cases of aids but may
as far as we know lead to transmission of the virus? Or what?

Some go there to dance, some to meet people, some, apparently, to drink and
think about dancing.  And some go to watch the other people.  I'm sure there
are other reasons as well.
Problem:  if people go there for all kinds of different reasons, how can
everyone get what they want out of the scene?
Answer from most people (and we hope to get them out of the gene pool):
assume the other person is there for the same reason you are there, and be
obnoxous.
If I went to a singles bar to dance, I wouldn't want to talk.  But if I
went there to meet people, I would.  The main problem is there are those
who go to get laid, and they assume everyone else does as well.  But the
overtly rude behavior that is the only defence against these toadies offends
and hurts the nice people who are simply at cross-purposes.
For this, I recommend that if you want to dance, ask someone to dance, and if
you want to start a conversation, ask if you can join {whomever}.  And don't
be rude, except in self-defence.  And don't think the less of someone who
looks like he/she wants to ask to do either, but does nothing.
Of course, this doesn't cover rude behavior on the dance floor, such as
wandering hands and simply walking off, but toadies will be toadies.  Say this
to yourself three times when it happens, and you'll feel smug, at least.
But don't put up with it.
There are some who feel left out if they don't ask, and guilty if they do.
Why?  They get the impression the askee resents the interruption.

Don't generalize about all rock music like that!  I like more sophisticated

I've said (posted) this before, and I'll say it again.  What's
wrong with going out to get laid?  It's just as valid a goal
as going out to dance or going out to meet people.  The only
problem I can see with it would be dishonesty, i.e.,
don't tell someone you're interested in really getting to know
them if you just want to go to bed with them.
I know this was not meant to be one of Eric's major points,
but I had to react to it because this kind of attitude
seems to come up on the net all the time.
Did I just hallucinate the Sexual Revolution, or did everyone
else just forget it (or worse, believe Time's cover story
that it's over).
Again, sorry Eric.  I don't mean to pick on you in particular.
I'm trying to use your posting to make a larger point.

The problem isn't that they are going out to get laid, the problem
is that they are ASS-U-MEing that everyone else is also out to
get laid.  Can you say ""egocentric""?  Good!
People go to bars for a variety of reasons.  Some go to drink. (Hopefully
these people are taking the bus/cab/etc back home)  Some go to dance.
Some go to play videogames.  Some go to meet people (in general).  Some
are looking for an SO.  Some are looking for a one-night-stand.  Some
are out-of-town with nothing better to do.  Some just tagged along when
the rest of the volleyball team went.  Some go to see the band.  Some go
to 'scope-out the crowd. (people watch)  Some go to sit in front of the
projection TV and laugh at the Cubs.  And so on...
Anyone going to a bar and ASS-U-MEing that anyone else there is there
for anything resembling the same reasons is highly likely to be
dissappointed.

This is a prevalent deception.  Let's face it; the attitude of the
people I am trying to ridicule resembles a Minimax game tree strategy
rather than a human social interaction.  Because of this, these sorts
will follow any behavior they think will achieve the goal.
It would be nice if there was some socially acceptable way that people
who are interested in spending the night with anyone could communicate
this outright, rather than engaging in mating dances of ludicrous
sophistication.  The real purpose of the Sexual Revolution was (I thought)
to allow people to be more honest about their sexual feelings and
desires.  Unfortunately, I don't think it's working.
The only real advantage of this would be that people who want to dance
could dance, people who want to meet people can meet people, and people
who want to satisfy their carnal urges can do that too, all without
social firewalking, deception, hurt feelings, etc, etc, etc.  That is,
without worrying that the person you are talking to now doesn't want
what you want.  Of course, there also has to be a socially acceptable
way of saying either yes or no, to any of the above propositions.
Alas, there is currently no socially acceptable way to communicate *just*
what you want out of the person you are talking to.  And reading body
language and vocal inflections is difficult in a hot, smoky, dark, and
noisy singles' bar.
This doesn't solve the whole problem, of course, but I think it might be
an improvement.  Any better ideas?

I don't think very many people are fooled.  After all,
if you really wanted to get to know someone, why go to a place
which is:
	A)  Too loud to talk.
	B)  Too dark to see.
	C)  Too smokey to smell.
	D)  Too progressive for touch (Lawrence Welk style) dancing.
There is no such thing as instant intimacy.  Sex is no substitute.
On the other hand, it sure makes being lonely a lot more fun.

The Sexual Revolution is over.  We lost.  Herpes and AIDS won.

responses, I got 150. Because of that, I decided not to do some of the
things I'd hoped to do, such as add in specific comments from people. Many

How to read this survey: Editorial comments will be surrounded by square
brackets. The number of people who made a specific response is noted by the
number in parenthesis. Some questions I removed all responses that were
made only once to make the size of the article tolerable-- it seems that
there is at least one person on the net who likes something, but not
neccessarily two *grin*. If you have further questions or comments, feel
free drop me a line at ..!nsc!chuqui  or nsc!chu...@decwrl.arpa.
1) what is your name?
	[ data not compiled-- for some reason every answer was different!]
	[many people also answered the questions 'what is your quest?' and
	 'what is your favorite color?'-- the search for the holy grail and
	 blue seemed to be the most popular answers]
2) sex
119 - male
 31 - female
[ yes was not an appropriate response. popular, but not appropriate. As
expected, there is a strong imbalance of bodies on the net, mainly because
the computer industry is still heavily male oriented. It isn't as bad as I
thought it might be, though]
3) Age
(male)	(female)
  6 	   1	- <20
 42 	  11	- 20-25
 38 	  11	- 26-30
 19 	   7	- 31-35
  9 	   0	- 36 - 40
  3 	   0	- >40
[ the youngest was in their mid-teens, the oldest in his 60's. The average
age seems to be about 23-24 for men, and 26-27 for women]
4) Profession
administrative assistant, cad/cam designer, communications tech
computer consultant, computer engineer, computer nerd
computer operator, computer scientist(3), design scientist
digital signal processing researcher, ee(2), electronic tech(2)
employee development, engineer(2), hardware design, human factors consultant
ic designer(2), manager, manager of software engineering, marketeer
mechanical engineer, member technical staff(4), military strategy analyst
model builder, professor, programmer(49), software consultant
software designer(4), software engineer(12), student consultant(3)
student(56), system administrator(5), system programmer(7), system support
system engineer(4), tech pubs manager, technical instructor, technical writer(3)
training, unix tinkerer, walking reference manual, world war one flying ace
writer
[many people had more than one thing they called themselves-- I used all of
them as applicable (especially for things like student/programmer). I
should have split out grad students separately, I think. Although it
doesn't show here, women seemed to be more likely to be in non-technical or
perepherally technical positions rather than hardcore programming]
5) Where do you live?
canada(8), east(30), midwest(32), northeast(26), northwest(14)
rocky mountains(2), south(4), southwest(5), west(29)

[ my apologies to the canadians for pretending they don't exist-- this data
should have been split out much better than it was-- once I realized this I
was too far into it to go back and restart. Many people made comments such
as 'new jersey' or 'chicago' as their region, and it would have been
interesting (in retrospect) to not only look at where people live, but how
they view the area they live in (a number of people mentioned 'New York' as
being an area all to its own, for example). I punted canadian provinces
completely, unfortunately. sigh]
6) Current Status
attached(10), divorced(4), engaged(4), married(14), separated(4), single(107)
[It is interesting to see how people view themselves-- if you are divorced,
do you consider yourself divorced or single (again)? This can give you (and
me) a perspective on how you see yourself. As expected, the single group
dominated, for some reason. I probably should have broken it down in the
question to single/happy and single/dating single/attached, etc... because
some people commented they were happily single and some people commented
they were not so happily single-- it would have been interesting to break
down those as well...]
7) Sexual Preference (1 to 6)
1 [heterosexual](133)
2 (6)
3 (4)
6 [homosexual] (4)
[The numbers, for those that asked, are the Kinsey scale, used to rate
relative sexual preferences. I hadn't expected things to be quite as biased
towards string heterosexuality, but it may be that people are a little wary
to discuss that information on a public net with a relative stranger (or
even a chuqui, for that matter... *grin*). My thanks to those that did
overcome their hesitance to discuss this openly]
8) Do you read net.singles, mod.singles, or both?
both(93)
mod.singles(23)

[mod.singles is still an open issue whether or not it will really succeed.

I sincerely hope, Allen, this was an attempt to accept my plea
for a restoration of sanity. Of course you had to stick in
a few more pot shots, but we all know by now what you are like.

 joining groups, making choices, and comparing being ""happy as a homosexual""
 with being ""unhappy as a stereotypical macho asshole"">
Between the back and forth banter about who's a bigot and who's not, and
the discussions on jerks versus nice guys, and the other assorted flambazes,
I've been relatively quiet.  But I see a lot in common in all of these
somewhat disjoint discussions.
First off, I got some flack when I said a few weeks ago that sexuality was a
matter of personal choice.  George Labelle and Alan Wexelblat pounced on me
for that, saying 1) that they could never see themselves simply ""choosing""
some alternate sexuality [LABELLE], and 2) that there are people who have 
homosexual desires who feel evil/sinful for having them, though they cannot
rid themselves of such desires [WEXELBLAT].  Alan's point, apparently, was
that such people do not make a choice, that they are trapped by inborn/internal
feelings.  Yet they clearly ARE making a choice!  They are saying:  ""I don't
like having homosexual feelings.  I don't want to be a homosexual.  I want to
be a heterosexual.""  If such a choice is made in a positive way (""I want to
be sexually attracted to MOTOSs, but I cannot.""), then one can only hope that
some psychological assistance may someday get them what they want.  But (and
this seems more likely), if the choice is made in a negative way (""I don't
want to be a homosexual because being homosexual is wrong and I would be a
lesser person for being one.""), then that would be truly sad.  Sad because
things like low self-esteem (even self-hatred) and feelings of guilt are seen
as reasons to WANT not to be what they are.  Which gets us back to the original
offering from Jeff Sargent that started this whole discussion.  Do these
people ""not want to be"" as they are because they have chosen to want to be
something else, or is the self-hatred and/or guilt manifesting itself to the
point where it is themselves that they want to be ""rid of"", and not the
elements of their psychological make-up?
Which brings me to the content of a series of conversations I have had via mail
with Steve Dyer.  I put forth the point that there are some people who make the
choice to be gay, not because they are sexually attracted to MOTSSs, but rather
because they feel things in common with the gay community:  having mannerisms
and behaviors *associated* by the non-tolerant general public with being gay
(often stronger and more malicious epithets are used), not fitting with the
stereotypical straight behavior patterns, not engaging in activities
""appropriate"" to your ""assigned"" gender roles (or engaging in inappropriate
ones).  Joining the gay or lesbian community seems an appropriate choice for
such people precisely because of the commonality that they share with members
of the chosen community, but it does not seem to be a rational reason for
choosing homosexuality as a sexual lifestyle, unless indeed one is sexually
attracted to MOTSSs.
Around this time, Trish Millines fired the shot heard 'round the net, with the
echoes still reverberating.  For those of you who have forgotten what Trish
said after all the back-and-forth between 'rainbow' (Robert ? -- sorry) and
Alan Driscoll that followed... well, I've forgotten a lot of it, too.  But the
crux of the discussion that followed revolved around her statement that she
was a lesbian BECAUSE she thought the men she had come in contact with were
generally (""generally"" is probably not strong enough a word) assholes.  Well,
Alan thought that was a prime example of bigotry, and that bigotry from a
member of an oppressed group towards an oppressor (lesbians cf. men) was
bigotry just the same.  From there it was a series of volleys that led into
mass disorder.  But among the things that did come out were these:  1) Yes,
Trish's choice appears to be a ""negative"" choice, somewhat like the ones I
describe above (in that she said she chose to be a lesbian based not on being
attracted to women, but rather on being repulsed by men), 2) Compare it to
eating vegetables.  When I was a kid, I had a violent reaction to eating
eggplant; several times (I threw up).  What would you say was the likelihood
of such a kid wanting to eat eggplant thereafter?  I'd venture to say that
Trish's experiences with men is roughly analogous to my experiences as a child
with eggplant. (Aha!!  A new slogan!!  A woman without a man is like Rich Rosen
without eggplant. :-)  For me there were lots of other foods I could still
choose from (like chocolate :-))))))).  For Trish, if she wanted to have sexual
relationships, there was only one other sex to choose from.  Of course, I could
have tried to (and eventually I did) eat eggplant once again later on in life.
I could just as easily have chosen not to. I don't think I would have if, after
trying it again, I had the same reaction.  Infer from this what you like...
Which, in turn, leads me to the other point I wanted to make.  A lot of people,
males, Alan Driscoll and Greg Woods among them, took umbrage at Trish's
generalizations about men.  But how unjustified was that generalization?
Behavior like that which Trish described seems to be the status quo and not
the exception among so-called modern American males.  Pick the statement apart,
and you'll find that what it really meant (though Trish did not say this
outright) was that 99% of the men she has met BEHAVED like macho assholes!!
Yup, you've got guys out there who put on that whole act (yeah, for some it's
no act, it comes naturally!) just because they want to impress their friends,
or because they think they have to, or because they don't know any other
behavior.  (Like Sharon Badian said in her article on how behaviors propagate
from parent to child:  if a boy sees that kind of behavior in his father, he's
likely to grow up to be the same way; and, apropos to the ""woman who marry/date
jerks"" discussion, if a girl sees her mother accepting that sort of behavior
from her father as the status quo, she's likely to grow up expecting that in
a boyfriend/husband/other SO MOTOS type.)
Roughly, that's the inverse of the behavior I described earlier.  In that,
some people ""become"" gay/lesbian because they feel a commonality with gays/
lesbians based on other factors than sexuality.  (As Sophie Quigley mentioned,
some people make such decisions as a sort of sociopolitical statement rather
than a statement of sexual preference.)  On the other hand, other
people fulfill stereotypical heterosexual sex roles (like macho provider male
and obedient sex-object female) because they think they're supposed to or
because they don't know anything else.  Basically, I think it's pure
unadulterated bullshit for someone to feel they have to join a particular
group (e.g., homosexuals) because they have things in common with its members,
only to be forced to ""adhere"" to other ""requirements"" for being in that group
unrelated to one's own individuality.  And it's just as much bullshit to be
required to fit into the stereotypical roles defined for groups that you are a
member of (e.g., heterosexuals).  Actually, I could have just as easily
interchanged the positions of my ""e.g.""'s, there.  Or I could have given
numerous other examples of groups (religions, nationalities) that would fit the
bill just as well.
I don't pretend to know where Trish Millines fits in to all of this.  And, with
that in mind, I'm unfit to make speculations about why she made the choice she
did and about the relative merits of that choice.  And, in all likelihood, so
are the rest of us.  Trish excepted.
I *can* speak for me; and I, for one, don't appreciate stereotypical sex roles,
or being expected by other people to adhere *to* them.  Being called an
""asshole"" by someone who expects me to behave a certain way because I'm male
repulses me just as much as being called a ""queer"" by someone who finds I don't
behave that same certain way.  I generally wouldn't appreciate other people
telling me what group I should belong to, would you?  (Especially when those
people don't even like the groups they put you in.)
