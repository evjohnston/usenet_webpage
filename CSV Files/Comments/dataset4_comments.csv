I get a lot of mail.  In fact, my collected mboxes will soon approach 2
megabytes.  Most is positive, some negative, but only very rarely do I
get a letter like the following that so offends my sensibilities that I
feel I have to share it.  In the interest of fairness, I have kept the
identity of the perpetrator of the letter anonymous, but if he wants to
step forward and take the blame, I certainly have no objection.  What 
follows are excerpts from the letter and my (admittedly lengthy and
self-righteous) responses:

	First, there is a difference between unproven and proven not.
Calcium to prevent Osteoporosis is unproven, and although tenuous, makes
enough sense not to protest about it.  Vitamin C's trials with the common
cold have been so dissapointing that one has to wonder why people still
spend their collective billions to enrich Hoffman-LaRoche (one of the
largest drug companies in the world who makes 90% of the world's Vitamin
C, including most that is repackaged and sold as HEALTH FOOD).  Immunogen,
the alleged subject of this letter, has an alleged mechanism so laughably
dubious that one truly has to marvel at the fraud being perpetrated.
	Secondly,  I and every good medical student realize that 50% of
medical theories are wrong.  the trouble is that at any given time, we
don't know which half.
	Thirdly, if a M.D. gives a bad treatment, I will not defend it.
At least three times in the past year, I have, with appropriate caveats
related to distance, expressed extreme scepticism over actual prescribed
treatments, 2 of which were later changed.  As another example,
when people ask me what to do for a cold, while telling them that Vitamin
C is useless, I also mention that going to see a doctor is worse, even
detrimental, so have some chicken soup, have someone call you ""bubula"", and
enjoy your 2 days of glorious misery.

	OK, Simple. First Aspirin was introduced before the era of
rational drug design, but that's not the answer you want.
	The answer is that one doesn't have to know how a drug works to
use it.  All that is necessary is that it does work, and that it does so
at safe doses -- proven safety and efficacy, not necessarily mechanism.
	Besides, we still don't know how Aspirin works, and if you 
think we do, you are sadly mistaken.

	Now this really insults my intelligence, and it is amazing how often
people use it, not just on me, but on anyone in medicine.  It is The Big
Lie - but that's not the point.  Leaving the AMA aside, and ignoring its
motivations, mine have been put in question.  I am a medical researcher.
The disease I work on had 4 cases in the United States last year. On the
other hand, 200 MILLION people are infected in South Asia, more than the
population of the U.S.  I am not in it for the money, and I could care
less about AMA policy on the subject, or on almost any subject for that
matter.  If I agree with AMA policy more than I disagree (which is
probably true), it is because those particular policies make sense.
	Finally, let me set the record straight.  The AMA does not license
a physician.  The state does.  Only about 1/4-1/3 of all doctors are AMA
members, and I'm sure most of them (like myself) only join because it
publishes an excellent journal (JAMA).
> the AMA opposed the warnings on tobacco products (interestingly enough, the

> 
	If it did oppose the warnings, it changed it's policy years ago.
It divested from Tobacco stocks in the early 70s, it just recently banned
all smoking at its national meeting.  It official policy is now to get
warnings on all smokeless tobacco, and to ban all smoking related
advertising.  Is this yet another case where the sins of the fathers
must be borne by the children.  I think not - it has atoned.

> 
	You don't have to look for them for guidance, as is your wont.
Unreliable, I won't quibble.  Unbelievable, what's to believe. Unethical,
I just can't buy that, especially given the demonstrated paucity of
ethics ascribed to a sizable number of alternative health care providers,
or to put it in the vernacular, the all-too common quack.  Projection,
perhaps?  Are the sellers of Immunogen ethical?  Is Carlton Fredericks
ethical when he attacks ""orthodox medicine"" for banning Chelation
therapy for heart disease when there is not only no evidence that it works,
but no good reason why it should?
	JAMA routinely publishes articles that say bad things about drugs
that carry full page ads.  It didn't cover up the problems with Coronary
Bypass, EC-IC anastomoses, Radial Keratotomy despite the fact that the
poor results will discourage the operations and cost surgeons doing those
operations lost income.
	In contrast, when was the last time you saw Prevention magazine
run anything that said anything bad about a product advertised in it.
Did you ever see a book in a health food store that told you NOT to
use dietary supplements (such as those available 2 racks over).
>    So what good are they?
	As far as I'm concerned, the AMA puts together an excellent
magazine (JAMA), an interesting weekly newspaper (American Medical
News) and moderately interesting specialty journals (I get Archives
of Internal Medicine).  It's publishing activities, to me, completely
justify its continued existence, and I could care less about its
politics.
Well, that's my story. Not that it matters.
I realize I've violated the cardinal rule of never arguing with a fool
because people might not be able to tell the difference, and that what
I said is actually as futile as Don Quixote at the windmill to those
who already have their minds made up.  But it had to be said.
And yes, I feel better already.
Thank you.

AIDS is probably coterminous with other blood vectors as well,

Medical opinion considers that these vectors may enhance the 
epidemic but believes, on the basis of the evidence so far in 
hand, that the primary vector for African AIDS has been vaginal
intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients.  Anal intercourse is apparently fairly rare in such
encounters (they've interviewed prostitutes and clients).
Recently, some US doctors announced the first corroborated

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

	Quote from Laurence,Jeffrey, 1985, The Immune system in AIDS,
		Scientific American,Dec.,vol.253,no.6,p.84-93.
	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become 
	increasingly well defined; they include homosexual and
	bisexual men, abusers of injected drugs, the sexual
	partners of people in AIDS risk groups, and children born
	of mothers at risk. Recipients of blood transfusions and blood
	products have also contracted AIDS, but screening of
	donated blood for evidence of infection has drastically
	reduced their risk. The fact that the disease shows
	*NO SIGN* of spreading beyond those groups, except to
	predictable targets such as women who are artificially
	inseminated from infected donors, indicates that the
	virus is ONLY transmitted through the blood or through
	sexual intercourse. *ALL EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE INDICATES

	This is a good article on how this virus affects the immune
	system in great detail. The one thing of note that has
	come out of the studies is that it ""appears that the total
	collapse of the immune defenses in AIDS victims stems
	largely from a single defect : a reduction in the number
	and a change in the function of the T4 lymphocytes, one
	of the many distinct kinds of cells that make upthe immune
	system."" Some how it seem incrediable how the bodies defenses
	can collapse from the failure of just one element.

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune

	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated
can either be disputed or criticized as misleading.
From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions
and Answers,""  published by the Department of Health, New York State,
Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

says, it can't hurt and may be helpful.  The only reservation is for those
who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such
""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, and
hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the
least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine.  This is the only reason he
is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual
contact contracting AIDS through oral sex with infected female
prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with

determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

	Whenever someone asks me how bad AIDS is, I respond, ""Well at least it
isn't as bad as Lassa Fever.""
	It begins with fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a sore throat (just
like a cold.)  However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces every
organ to close shop.
	Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseases
known to man.  It was first described in the early 70s by a group of Columbia
U. researchers.
	The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in a 
missionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.
After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospital
in Jos, where she died the next day.
	Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of the
disease, and a third was deathly ill.  She was flown to New York (prompting
several staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )
and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,
survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.
	Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to study 
additional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing the
epidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,
the first outbreak's final victim.
	(Source: Ten Diseases You Were Better Off Not Knowing About)
	(        G. Thomas, MD and L. Shreiner, MD _That's_Incurable_)
	Lassa Fever is not AIDS.
	However, in a final twist, Suramin, one of the antiviral drugs used
to treat Lassa fever, is currently undergoing clinical trials against the
AIDS virus.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

Since dentists learned that sugar caused cavities they have been in
the forefront of the research involving sugar.  The medical profession
has been ""johnnie come latelies"" in this field.
As far back as 1964 dental research had shown that a moderate dose of
sugar was sufficient to drastically reduce the ""phagocytic index"".
For those of you who don't know:  The phagocytic index is a measure of
how many bacteria a white blood cell ingests in one hour.  It is a
very accurate measure of one form of immunity.  Now that AIDS research
$ has made it possible to measure many aspects of immunity in fine
detail, and sugar has hit the ""big time"" by being on the cover of
Newsweek, I'm sure it won't be long before these studies are repeated
measuring many more parameters.
I will just list the table that summarizes that first study and wait
for the predictable denials from those who still don't want to know:

       1964
This study has, of course, been replicated many times.  The last time
that I am aware of was by Emanual Cheraskin, MD, DDS, who was Chairman
of the department of Dentistry at the University of Alabama Dental
School at the time.  He has gone on to dedicate his life to educating
the public, and any professionals who will listen, of the pervasive
health burdens caused by refined carbohydrates.
The same amount of glucose ingested in an unrefined state (in other
words, with all the 48+ nutrients it grew up with--in the exact
proportion that it existed in nature) causes no reduction in the
phagocytic index.
You know, a grain of wheat is alive.  No matter how long it is in
storage it is slowly running its own ""Krebs cycle""(the same metabolic
cycle we humans use to process all forms of carbohydrates).  Those 48+
nutrients are present in the exact proportion, and in the exact amount,
necessary to digest exactly the amount of carbohydrate in that grain
of wheat. Nature is pretty tidy that way.
If we eat the grain of wheat as it is we get everything needed to
metabolize exactly that much starch.  If we allow the food processors
to remove the 48+ nutrients first, then, when we eat the refined
product, our bodies must take those 48+ nutrients from storage in
order to run the ""Krebs Cycle"".  So long as a certain % of refined
foods is not exceeded the human has reserves enough to get along.  The
best estimate by those who have taken the time to understand the field
(so far as we do understand it) is that we can tolerate about 15% of
our carbohydrates refined.  Above 15%, even with our presently
available crude measuring techniques, measurable decreases in function
occur.  The present average in this country is 60% refined &
increasing every year.  We have but to look at comparable statistics
from Guam (which has persistantly led our % here in the US by about 5
years--presently 65%+) to see what we can expect of our future chronic
disease incidence.
The problem is not a lack of research data but the unwillingness to
accept things that hit so close home as our own eating habits--one of
the most personal of things.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

	My response was ""Well, you can't rule it our, but it's not something
I worry about.""  Perhaps the following can be much more reassuring:
	A mosquito is not so much like a hypodermic syringe injection as it is
like a needle-stick.  In the last four years, over 500 nurses, doctors, and
med students have accidentally stuck themselves with needles while drawing
blood from patient's with AIDS.  All are being followed by the CDC.  Not one
of them has even turned Antibody-positive (which neccessarily precedes the
disease, but which is not necessarily an obligate precursor of it.)
	I hope the above, which translates to ""It ain't happened yet"" is
more reassuring than my first article.

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

the obvious.  But, as of this point, the evidence that AIDS can be transmitted
by semen has been only circumstantial, although fairly strong (its spread by
sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.
	I just thought this might also be of interest to those who are
still wondering to what rigors medical 'proof' must be subjected to.

associated press release (the day after I posted the Holistic
explanation of AIDS) substantiating what I had said.  The reason for
feeling gratified is obvious.  The sadness comes with the recurring
reminder, we Holistic types keep getting, that the power and money are
still going to the people who don't know what is going on.  While the
practitioners who have understood the solution to most of the medical
problems we face today, for at least 10 years, are still being
attacked by their colleagues as ""quacks and charlatans"".
Eventually, even the most obtuse ""medical experts of the day""
understood the Pasteur was right.  Even Pasteur, on his deathbed,
said: ""If I had it to do over, I would have spent more time on
individual immunity than on the germ!""
The strength of any theory depends on how much of the observed
phenomena are explained by that theory.  In my >25 years of practicing
and teaching medicine I have seen no approach that explains the
observed, or gets the results, 1/4th as well as the holistic paradigm.
Eventually the truth will out.  This theory has been advanced several
times this century, by many prominent practitioners of medicine.
However, because we still didn't have the technology, or sufficiently
advanced knowledge and methods of communicating that knowledge, the
approaches tended to die with their practitioners.  I HAVE GREAT FAITH
THAT, THIS TIME, THE BREAKTHROUGH WILL NOT BE LOST TO HUMANITY AS A
WHOLE!
AIDS is doing us a favor:  It is finally serious enough to get the
attention of the majority of the people.  You know, an organism is a
perfect microcosm of the population of a country:  Until anough of the
cells of your body shout for attention (a measure of how sick you
are), you are not likely to change what you are doing.  Until enough
of the people in this country (both lay and professional) hurt anough
to understand enough we will keep on in the same direction we have
been going.
Fortunately, the environment, both physical and psychological, is not
going to let us get away with the wrong direction much longer.
Legionaire's Disease was not a loud enough warning.  So, we got Toxic
Shock.  When that wasn't enough, we got Reye's Syndrome, Kawasaki
Syndrome, MacDonald's Hemorrhagic Colitis, Post Polio
Syndrome-----AIDS--; we almost have the ""new disease of the month"".
ALL of these disorders are caused by the same basic problem I
described in net.med 817: AIDS IS PREVENTABLE.
We deserve better than we are presently getting from those we have
entrusted with the ""disease care system"" of this country.  It is about
time we start looking to the TRUE ""health care professionals""
presently trying to get the attention of the government and the
public.  They are the HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSN. and other Holistic
medical practitioners.  The longer it takes the more people will
suffer and the more it will cost.
Those who continue to beat on the doors of the old system for answers
deserve what they get. Those who listen to them also deserve what they
get.

incomplete scientific evidence into a grand theory fully of fanciful
embellishments but truly lacking in any kind of scientific basis, let alone
scientific proof.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT PEOPLE WITH ""HEALTHY"" IMMUNE SYSTEMS
ARE SOMEHOW PROTECTED FROM CONTRACTING AIDS.  One might as well make the
same kind of tautological statement about disease in general, and it would
still lack any predictive value for the individual.  Yeah, AIDS is
preventable: to be 100% safe, don't have sex outside of a monogamous
relationship which has remained monogamous for the past 5 years.  The next
best thing is to avoid exchanging bodily fluids with strangers.  Any
""vigorously healthy"" or even ""average"" person would have to be out of his
mind to think that his presumably healthy immune system is immune to
getting AIDS: there are too many ""vigorously healthy"" people who are now
seriously ill or dead.  In many cases, it only took a single infected sex
partner.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

Study: AIDS Robs Cells Of ""Recognition"" Ability by Richard Saltus
===============================================
[Following close on the heels of another major discovery* :]
	The first step in the destruction of the immune system by the
AIDS virus is a preemptive attack on the ability of key immune cells
to recognize foreign organisms, a study shows.
	The virus acts with such precision that the immune system is 
utterly unable to mount a response, even though the capacity to
counterattack still exists, government researchers said.
	Thereafter, normal immune competence collapses and the victim
is left prey to a wide range of infections and tumors that cause the
syndrome's high mortality.
	The report in today's New England Journal of Medicine adds to
the growing evidence on how the AIDS virus - known as HTLV-III or LAV
[or ARV] - destroys the very defenses designed to disable it.
	The virus' name, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, signifies that it
attacks T cells, the white blood cells that orchestrate the complex
response of the immune system.  The T cells recruit other cells into
the fight, cause the release of certain antiinfection substances and
stimulate B cells to produce antibodies.
	AIDS victims have a drastically reduced force of ""helper"" T
cells, called T4, compared to the number of ""suppressor"" or T8 cells.
What has not been clear is whether the low number of T4 cells or some
inherent defect in the T4 cells is responsible for the progressive
failure of the immune system.
Resistance Tested
	Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases studied blood from 12 AIDS patients, challenging the immune
cells with substances that should cause the T4 cells to proliferate
rapidly.  In this test the T4 cells were not required to recognize a
foreign substance.  The cells responded normally, showing that they
retained the capacity to mount resistance to infection.
	Then the scientists mixed the blood with a foreign antigen,
a protein of the sort that the immune system would encounter should
the body be infected by an invading organism.
	This time there was no response.  To the researchers this
suggested that the T4 cells, which are equipped to distinguish what
is foreign from what is ""self,"" had lost that ability.
	Dr. H. Clifford Lane, who directed the research, said that the
infecting AIDS virus has been shown to attach itself to the T4 receptor,
a molecule on the surface of the T4 cell.  In effect, the virus blinds
the cell to foreign antigens.
	Lane said it was impossible to be certain whether the virus
uniformly knocks out the surface molecule on otherwise intact T4 cells,
or perhaps kills off a subpopulation of T4 cells that has the recognition
site.
	In any case, ""It's a very smart virus that came up with that way
of attacking the immune system,"" sad Lane.  He noted that these events 
occur early in the disease, leading to a cascade of later abnormalities as 
the immune system is devastated.
No New Therapies Implied
	Lane, in a telephone interview, said that the discovery does not
yet suggest any new therapies for the syndrome, but that it ""gives us a
better appreciation of how the AIDS virus is attacking and destroying the
immune system.""
	In an accompanying editorial, two Harvard scientists said that
increasing knowledge about the affinity of HTLV-III/LAV for the T4 cells
is helping to explain many of the puzzling aspects of the lethal syndrome
- and is raising some concerns.
	For one thing, said Drs. Richard S. Kalish and Stuart F. Schlossman,
when T4 cells multiply to fend off some other infection, they probably
become more vulnerable targets to infection by the AIDS virus.
	This may explain, they said, why exposure to the AIDS virus is less
likely to produce the syndrome in the absence of another infection, as in
people receiving tainted transfusions and health workers exposed to HTLV-III.
	However, the Harvard researchers also raised the possibility that,
in certain cases, the virus can infect not only T cells but also B cells.
""Such virally infected cells may function as a reservoir of virus,
potentially thwarting attempts at reconstitution of the immune system,""
they wrote.
	While there is still no effective treatment for AIDS, Schlossman
said in an interview, ""We've learned a great deal about the disease, and
the future is not so bleak as one might think.""
	*****************************************************
* In late June the discovery of a gene on HTLV-III which regulates
 the rate of growth of the virus was announced.  HTLV-III displays
 explosive growth at a rate up to 1,000 times as great as, eg, HTLV-I
 which is known to cause various cancers.  Manipulation of this gene
 suggests not only possibilities for eventual vaccine production but 
 even for the treatment of people already infected with the virus.
So, folks, it probably pays to keep up your general health, to avoid
other infections so as to deny the AIDS virus possible footholds in 
your bodies.

	For this, I looked in the AMA Drug Evaluations.  Two other places
that could be consulted are the PDR (Physician's Desk Reference) and
the Merck Index.  ALSO (and I was privately chastised for not mentioning
this more often),  call up your Doctor - for one, he has your history and
he knows your dosage.
	Thiazide-type diuretics block the reabsorbtion of Sodium, and the
water follows the Sodium out of the body.  They interfere with the 
production of dilute urine.
	Side effects: Pottasium may also be lost (see below). Also, the body
may respond to the loss of water, which has the effect of causing more
potassium to be lost, along with hydrogen ion and chloride ion. These have
certain effects of their own, which would be too technical for me to discuss.
	If you are worried about this, discuss the possibility of a 
Potassium sparing diuretic in addition to Thiazide. (I know nothing about
this particular facet, and I'm sure it's different for each patient.)
> 2. I have heard it rumored that there has been a study showing INCREASED

   > with untreated hypertensives. Is this only a rumor or is it true?
	The study you are referring to is MRFIT (Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial) and it was discussed in this newgroup several months
ago.  It is probably one of the most misrepresented studies of all time.
	It was set up like this: about 13,000 people with one of three
risks for heart disease (high BP, smoker, of High Cholesterol) were
placed in one of two groups: SI - Special Intervention, or UC - Usual
Care (i.e., ""You have high BP. Go see your doctor."")
	Both groups had lower mortality.  (R.J. Reynolds the tobacco maker
said it was because smoking didn't matter all that much -- the truth was
that even in UC, doctors told their patients to quit smoking, and they
did almost as often as those in the SI group.)  In fact, in many cases,
the UC group did as well as the SI group.  (This attests not so much to
the uselessness of the special intervention, as the quality of care
designated as 'Usual.')
As a whole, the Special Intervention did better than the usual care group.
(about 20-30% lower death rate)  However, in certain cases, the UC group 
did better than the SI group.  Or, put another way, the special group did worse.
	This one group of patients was, those with 1) high blood pressure,
AND 2) abnormal EKGs (indicative of heart muscle/electrical trouble).
	The reason was that this group was more likely to be put on diuretics,
which may lower serum POTASSIUM.  Abnormal potassium levels cause electrical
problems in nerves and muscles, and these people sufferred more heart attacks.
(Of course, this is now known because of MRFIT, and doctors look out for
this kind of thing.)
	Reference for this:
	Clinical Trials, Diuretics, and the Management of Mild Hypertension
	Marvin Moser, MD
	Archives of Internal Medicine -- Vol 144, April 1984, pp. 789-793.
	Note however, that MRFIT only concerned itself with moderate
hypertension - a pretreated diastole between 90 - 104. There is absolutely
no ambiguity concerning getting a higher blood pressure at least into that
range - lowering it is beneficial.

	I'm sure there is something much more substantial than this, but
many people who are overweight and hypertensive, see their blood pressure
drop to normal when they lose the weight.  That is indirect evidence that
nutrition plays a role. 
	There is supposedly some evidence that a diet high in fiber may 
help, possibly by changing the rate of absorbtion of ions from the gut.
However, I can provide no reference, and unless I can get confirmation (or
refutation) on this one, I'll have to consider it hearsay.
	I have also seen or heard about some suggestive but inconclusive
studies that not only HIGH Sodium, but also LOW Potassium and Calcium can
contribute to high BP. There was even some talk that Chloride -- the OTHER
ion in Salt (Sodium Chloride) may contribute, but Sodium is the biggie.

	Hypertension is found in all segments of the population. Blacks are
more prone than whites, males more than females. One sees it more in people
who are overweight, out-of-shape, who smoke, etc...
	As for the individual case, that is for you and your doctor to
work out.
	And if anyone on the net doesn't know their blood pressure, take
steps to get it taken.  Hypertension has no symptoms much of the time.

	You may have seen the article I posted a month ago, where researchers
evaluating biofeedback, meditation, and several other methods for lowering
blood pressure, ""lied"" to a control group, telling them that just taking
their own blood pressure several times a day would make it go down. They
were quite suprised when it actually did -- better than all the other
methods.  (Well, consider it another form of biofeedback.)

The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

	HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen,  although they are a group
of proteins that occur on every cell in the body.  There are 4 groups -
HLA-A,B,C are found on every cell.  HLA-D is particularly prominent on
White Blood Cells.  There are hundreds of types of each letter - so many
in fact, that probably no two people on Earth (except identical twins)
have the same arrangement.  HLAs are also known as Transplantation antigens
-- they are the cause of Rejection following Heart/Kidney/etc. transplant.
	One of them -  HLA-D4 has been shown to react with the antibody to
the virus that presumably causes AIDS.  This is the first case of a true
False Positive with known cause.
	Therefore, people who carry the HLA-D4 gene will register a positive
result to the AIDS blood test, whether or not they have been exposed to the
AIDS virus.  However, it can be checked via other means.
	One explanation for the phenomenon is that the only cell line in
which HTLV-3 will grow carries the HLA-D4, and hence the antibody is raised
to a HLA-D4/HTLV-3 hybrid (also known as a virally-altered self) and then
will react with each component separately.

From American Medical News, May 3, 1985, published by the AMA
page 1, 35.
	Anti-AIDS drugs promising.
	Intensive research over the past year has produced at least six
drugs that show early promise in treating acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS).
	These drugs are significant because they attack the virus itself,
rather than merely treating the infections and malignancies associated with
the disease.  Five drugs are now being tested in AIDS patients, the sixth is
undergoing in-vitro study.
	Each of the agents acts by interfering with the replication of the
AIDS-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV.
[]
	The most promising drugs are:
1. Suramin. Commonly used to treat sleeping sickness. It is thought to block the
cytopathic effect of the virus.  Although it can produce severe toxicity in
Africans with parasitic disease, it appears well tolerated in US AIDS patients.
2. HPA-23.  This drug also is an inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
Tested at the Pastuer Institute in France, two of four AIDS patients show no
sign of virus one month after receiving the drug.
3. Phosponoformate.  MGH researchers have shown this drug has persistent
anti-viral action ... Two Swedish patients now are receiving the drug.
4. Ribavirin. This decade old drug, believed to act as a nucleotide analog,
appears to inhibit HTLV-III replication in cultured cells. It's exact 
mechanism action remains unknown.
5. Alpha Interferon.  This has previously been shown to be effective against
Herpes Zoster, CMV, and influenza.  It is furthest along in clinical testing.
Stage 2 and 3 trials are planned in Boston, Seattle, and New York.
6. Amsanycin. In CDC in-vitro trials, this drug reduces infective virus by
90%. It is the least studied of the anti-AIDS drugs, and its mechanism remains
unclear.
No single ""magic bullet"" drug stands out as the answer to the AIDS epidemic.
Because they act on different sites, it may be best to use them simultaneously
or in sequence. There could be an additive, even synergistic, effect.

It seems to me that they are opening themselves up for a good lawsuit
(and maybe ?criminal charges?? - maybe there's lawyer on the net who can

	AP) The Government has approved a sec-
	ond screening test for blood contam-
	inated by acquired immune deficiency
	syndrome, or AIDS, after laboratory
	results indicating it was the most sens-
	itive indicator of possible exposure to
	the disorder.
 	  Electro-Nucleonics Inc. of Fairfield,
	N.J., was awarded the second license by
	the FDA ....
About 2 months ago, I ran a series of four articles on HTLV-3, the virus
that most likely causes AIDS. I spoke of the screening test as highly
accurate, and then received mail and flames otherwise.
	Well, here is the source of the misunderstanding. There are several
tests - the most sensitive being the Western blot, which I was referring to.
(This was reasonable, since most Test-Positive results were to be redone
with Western blots before accepting the results.) It has an accuracy of
99.8% or so.
	The first licensed test had an accuracy of approx. 93%. Tests under
development range from 82-95.6%.  These all use a system called ELISA (for
Enzyme-linked Immuno- S? Assay) which is much easier to do than a Western
Blot (Incidentally, Western Blot is so-called, because the first person
to do ""blotting"" was E.M. Southern, so the blot was nick-named the
""Southern Blot"", and each new technique was given a different direction and
the name stuck.) ELISA involves add sample, add reagant, check color change.
	Anyway, this new test has an accuracy of 99.6% (4 false positives
in 1000 people)  which is not much worse than Westerns.
 
	AND, of course the usual disclaimer:  Although everyone with AIDS
has been shown to have antibody to HTLV-3, the reverse is not true.
The presence of antibody to HTLV-3 does not signify that a person has or
will get AIDS, but has merely been exposed to it or a cross-reacting virus.

harbor HTLV-3 antibodies, and this bewildering state of affairs only
complicates the application of such tests.  Naturally, it isn't clear
in these cases whether the absence of antibodies reflects absence of
virus.  Does anyone have the original references?

Today in New York, the Scientists Institute for Public Information met
to gather all valid information on AIDS to give to the press and thus
insure the accuracy of news coverage & public knowledge. It was hoped that
such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But, as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused to attend, unable or unwilling to find time in his 
schedule.  The fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused
the creation of three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen:
HTLV-III by Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much research & testing.

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained
by the characteristics of the populations in which it occurs.

	Well, it was actually more than a single article, and there were 
similar articles in Science and Nature.  
The facts are:
	1. HTLV-3 (the Aids-Related Virus) is found primarily in blood, but
also in saliva and semen, and maybe other places that haven't been explored
yet.
	2. The rectum is a) bacteriologically speaking, an exceptionally dirty
place, and b) not designed for intercourse (wrong epithelium).
 
	However, Steve does have his point. Just because something makes sense
logically, doesn't mean it is correct. Also, just as a grammatical point, the
use of the word ""vector"" was wrong. The correct phrase should have been
""means of transmission.""

	Where do people come up with these things?
	The virus has been around Africa for years, and does not solely
affect gays there.  
	It is passed, both in Africa and among non-Gays in the US (mostly IV
drug users) much more efficiently from men to women than from women to men,
mostly because semen contains cells that could be infected with the virus
(as does in some people, saliva). Hence it would, for similar reasons, pass
efficiently from men to men.
	It's not actually gays, per se, it's only sexually active gays, and
they are also highly overrepresented among a whole variety of rare diseases,
mostly sexually transmitted ones, but also hepatitis, etc.
	Also, remember, one of the first AIDS victims back in 1977 
admitted having over 2000 sexual partners (I think in the previous year alone,
but that number may be over several). A few people like that and that's all
you need for a major epidemic.
 
	Conclusion: given the mode of transmission of the virus (in blood,
semen and saliva) and the fact that healthy carriers can pass the disease,
and given the promiscuity of a visible subgroup of the gay population, it's
not really much of a suprise (now anyway that more is known) that gays are
overrepresented among AIDS victims.

	The following is from the Jan 11, 1985 issue of JAMA (253/2),
""The Incidence Rate of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome in Selected
Populations""
	Incidence is defined as the number of new cases reported per
a given time, usually (and in this case) in years for a given population,
the higher the incidence, the higher the risk of getting a disease. For 
chronic diseases, it is usually steady. For epidemics, it tends to rise
dramatically (as in AIDS) and then fall (something that AIDS has yet to
do)
	Some of the data:
Annual Incidence: 	Year	cases		Rate/100,000
			1978	4		0.002
(in US, total pop.	1979    9		0.004	
age 5 and above)        1980	44		0.02
			1981	239		0.11
			1982	961		0.44
			1983	2501		1.20
			->5/84  3096		1.43
Note the nearly 1000 fold increase in incidence. This is clearly a disease in
the exponential stage.
	1.5/100,000 means 1 in 66,000 Americans has AIDS, or if they were
spread uniformly, that would be one for every sellout football game. (That
last example is of course, facetious, but illustrative)
	However, they are not spread uniformly, as seen below:
	Interpretation follows the data:
	Group			# cases		Incidence
 
	Single Men (US)		3,752           8.9
	SM in Manhattan		1,358	     	175.5
	SM in other NY boroughs   413		 37.6
	SM in SF		  473		204.5
	SM in LA		  308		 44.2
	IV Drug Users (US)	1,381		113.3
	IVDU in NY		  675           203.2
	IVDU in New Jersey	  188		269.0
	Haitians (US before 1978)  27		  1.8
	    (US after 1/1/78)	  192		 82.0
	Hemophiliacs (severe)	   33		298.5
		(mild)		    2		 43.2
	In female contacts of
	male IV drug users	   26             3.1
	Persons receiving blood
	Adult (> 10 units)	   25		  4.8
	Children(> 10 units)	    5		 22.5
	Children (10 or less)       5		  0.8
Comments:
	Most incidence data have trouble with the reporting of cases. In this
case, however, the number of cases is probably more accurate than the 
population estimate.
	This reason however, is the reason the incidence is for Single
Men, and not for Sexually Active Gay Men (which has been the usual
phrasing of the risk group) because it is very easy to tell if a man is
single, but much harder (and more controversial) to find out if he is gay,
or if he is sexually active (and how would you define that) In fact, 87% of
AIDS victims who are single men are gay or bisexual. (Same Source)
 
	For IV drug users, NJ may be higher because the estimate for NJ
only included heroin users, and for NY and USA included heroine and cocaine.
Also, IV drug users are usually less mobile than gays, so pockets may 
develope
	Note the numbers for Haitians. The very low number before '78
probably shows that the disease came to Haiti at approximately the same
time it came to the US.  It might have even spread there from the US.
Either way, it means that the island itself is not to blame.
	For hemophiliacs and blood donors, the data clearly suggests that
the disease is in fact spread by blood (though possibly not exclusively)
since the risk is related to the amount of blood that the patient receives.
	There is one other thing not visible from the above selected numbers.
Transmission from males to females is much more common than from females to
males. It may have something to do with females (tending to have less
partners, perhaps?) or it may actually say something about the mode of
transmission of the disease.	
	Robert Gallo of the NCI suggested that not just the virus but also
infected tissue was necessary for the most efficient transfer of the disease,
and sperm contains cellular matter, so it might follow.
	Of course, the disease can be spread without cells. Factor VIII
(for hemophiliacs) is cell-free and has 40 total cases.
	OK, this article is a little too long.
	Next time, more on the soon-to-be released blood test.
Oh, somebody wanted sources for my first article:
	Here they are, from Nature, Dec 20-27 1984 
 
	The CD4 (T4) antigen is an essential component of the receptor for
the AIDS retrovirus.     p. 763.
	T-lymphocyte T4 molecule behaves as the receptor for human 
retrovirus LAV.     p.767. 	
	I didn't cite them the first time because they hadn't been published
yet.

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

	The actual protein involved is called CD4, and it occurs on so-called
T4 cells.
	Now for some immunology:
	Blood Cells are divided into Red and White Cells.
	White Cells are divided into B-Cells which make antibodies and
T-cells, which are for cellular immunity (and also are the things that
cause graft rejection.)
	T-cells are divided into several classes (1 - 8 so far) of which
T4 are one of the most important kind.
	T4 cells are helper cells - they make the rest of the immune system
work better.
	Note: in the absence of T4 cells, the AIDS virus, which is HTLV-3
(also called LAV) cannot grow. Immunosuppressed people shouldn't be able to
get AIDS. Experimentally, immunosuppressed cats don't get FAIDS (Feline AIDS)
One of the reasons, therefore that Gays, Drug Users, etc., are more suseptible
to AIDS (Besides the fact that they are exposed to the virus more often) is
that they tend to get other infections more often which activate the immune
system and make more T4 cells for the AIDS virus to grow on. (Talk about
Molecular Catch-22s)
	I'm a MD/PhD candidate in Immunology and recently heard Robert Gallo
give a very well-organized seminar, so I'll followup with another posting
on the history of AIDS.

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual

*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

for exposure to HTLV-III.
I had dinner recently with a couple, one of whom is a psychiatrist, the other
a psychiatric social worker, who both work for Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Counseling Service.  Aside from the obvious issues of stigmatization and
confidentiality, they ask men who are concerned about HTLV-III exposure
and are considering being tested:
	""What would you do differently, if you knew?""
They argued pretty persuasively against being tested, for the following
reasons:
1.) a negative test is no license for increased sexual activity
    (to be meaningful, you'd have to be tested weeks to months after
    each new sexual partner, when in the meantime, you could be spreading
    the virus.)  In essence, every gay man should be behaving as if he were
    exposed, regardless of the test results.
2.) Denial (as in not knowing one's HTLV-III exposure) can be thought of as
    having some positive effects.  Too often, they have seen people who went
    to be tested out of curiosity, who, after hearing that they test positive,
    end up with severe emotional stress, certainly reducing their quality of
    life.

sentence he wasn't given, ie, one of solitary confinement.  The rationale
is, even if the prisoner never develops AIDS (he doesn't even show signs

who could subsequently come down with full-blown AIDS.  The warden added
an even lamer excuse: he was protecting said prisoner against the violent
reactions of other prisoners who fear AIDS.
Considering that 1/3 of all prisoners have a history of drug use and
addiction, that homosexual acts and rape are common in American prisons,
it's clear many prisoners in every prison probably are infected with the

  He said that, since 1949, biological warfare research centers knew
  about the highly lethal Visna virus in sheep. The virus grew easily

  He went on to say that it was likely that the potential of developing
  the Visna virus for use in biological warfare was considered by
  research establishments both in the East and the West, though ""it

  slow to develop"".
  The idea that the AIDS virus had been manipulated in the laboratory

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

Of course, the recommendation to avoid exchanging bodily fluids only
makes sense if either or both haven't been absolutely monogamous for the
past 5 or 6 years.  But even today's good boys and girls might not have
been in such a covetable position for that entire period--if one interprets
the recommendations strictly, even a single ""unsafe"" sexual experience since
1980 is enough to no longer feel 100% assured.
While I think it's great to be monogamous if that's OK with you two, it's
also pretty obvious that these recommendations are directed towards those
who haven't been practicing monogamy.  And that includes a lot more than
those whom you would call promiscuous.

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

expressions most of the time (the latter may be the result of the
usual expurgation of erotic gestures done by ratings-anxious directors:
only chaste kisses and ""supportive"" embracing, and for god's sake don't
portray sexual arousal in any form!).
But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

because of late nights at the disco and lots of poppers--they got it
because they were sufficiently promiscuous that their chances of coming
across an infected person was very high.  Now that HTLV-3 antibodies can be
found in a significant percentage of gay men, at least in certain cities
like NY, SF and LA, it is simply imprudent, if not suicidally foolish, to
indulge in ""unsafe sex"" practices, even if you meet ""Mr. Wonderful"" today

Sure, take care of yourself, get enough rest, and take Geritol.
But don't let that substitute for the simplest and most effective

skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters

such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical
rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery
of the AIDS mechanism.  But as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of
HTLV-III refused, unable to find time in his schedule to attend.  The
fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused the creation of
three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen: HTLV-III by
Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France.
Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur
Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23
to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient.  Two years later all trace of
HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to
have fully recovered.  HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and
is unknown in the US.  It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten.
Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients.  However, the
drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system.
Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood-
stream.  How does it work?  When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it
must immediately reproduce.  It does so by latching on to the cell's
genes.  HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches
on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing.
If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably
can't develop.
However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help
many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the
immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage
done.  Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus.  Thus, the
drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.
Nobel Laureate David Baltimore of MIT & others present also cautioned
people against expecting a vaccine to be forthcoming.  Vaccines typi-
cally take YEARS to develop and require much reserch & testing.","2sl3JcHlEH8J",18,1985-02-09,-12,30

Newport Beach, Calif. -
Scientists have for the first time identified an antibody that inactivates
the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome virus in laboratory experiments, a
step toward development of an AIDS vaccine,  a researcher said yesterday.
Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute,  who headed one of the
two teams that announced discovery of the likely AIDS virus last April,
said the antibody knocks out the ability of the AIDS virus to infect cells.
But Gallo warned that the discovery ""does not prove you're going to be 
successful in finding a vaccine.""
Asked if he believes an anti-AIDS vaccine can be developed, Gallo replied:
""I am hopeful....but it's really hard to say when.""
Considerable research must be done to determine whether the anti-AIDS anti-
body will destroy the virus in the human body as effectively as it destroys
it in the laboratory.
Gallo described the discovery while talking to reporters attending a 
scientific conference in Newport Beach sponsored by the City of Hope 
Medical Center.  He said the discovery, made only recently,  has not 
been reported in a scientific journal.
The so-called ""neutralizing antibody"" was identified by Dr. Marjorie 
Robert-Guroff in Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute 
and independently by Dr. Martin Hirsch at Massachusetts General Hos-
pital, Gallo said.
Reached in Boston, Hirsch confirmed the discovery of the antibody against
AIDS, but declined further comment, except to say his findings will soon 
be published in a letter to the editor of a medical journal -- which he
declined to identify -- and will be presented in April during an AIDS 
conference in Atlanta.
The virus attacks a certain class of white blood cells called T-cells,
which help the body ward off disease.  The virus is called HTLV-III,
and was discovered by Gallo and his colleagues last year.
It is the third of a class of human viruses called human T-cell lympho-
tropic viruses.
A closely related virus, called LAV, or lymphadenopathy associated virus,
was discovered about the same time by researchers at the Pasteur Institute
in Paris.
A major question has been whether the viruses are identical.  If they are
very different, it could complicate the search for a vaccine.
But Gallo said yesterday that HTLV-III and LAV essentially are the same
despite a 5 percent to 10 percent variation in the genetic code which
governs activities of the 104 different types of AIDS virus Gallo said
have so far been isolated.
It is not yet known whether those genetic differences mean the viruses
act differently biologically, he said.  If they did, it might mean that
a vaccine effective against one variety of AIDS virus might not work
against another.
But, Gallo added: ""Right now we can't say there's any important biologi-
cal difference.""

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

mechanism for AIDS & why only some people exposed to the pathogen
(whatever it is; NO ONE yet knows for sure) develop full-blown
AIDS.
They hypothesize that AIDS is transmitted by receiving T-cells
themselves from an infected person.  This results in the mild
AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and asymptomatic forms (ie, ""car-
riers"").  Full-blown AIDS occurs by receiving T-cells into
which the pathogen has injected genetic material.  This hypo-
thesis is really the first anyone's advanced which feasibly
explains the very puzzling selectivity of AIDS.
Has anyone else heard anything about this?  The US medical
establishment as usual seems hopelessly out of it.  Gallo's
HTLV-III find seems to be declining in signifigance as each
month passes.
The French see a lot of heterosexual cases traceable to Central
Africa.  The current NYNative has a long article on the intensive
African research that's just beginning, performed mainly by French
researchers, but with a half-dozen Americans participating.  The
author believes that the next 6 months of reports of African research
results will dispel once and for all any perceptions of AIDS as a
""gay disease"".
The current Native has other AIDS articles that show how complicated
the AIDS research picture has grown.  One physician in a Florida
town with a large Haitian population reports a high incidence of
HTLV III and a growing number of AIDS cases.  He believes that AIDS
is in fact KS, a relatively new or rare form, not the sluggish skin
cancer, but one which grows in lymph nodes & never appears externally.
His reasoning is that every AIDS patient doctors have thought to test
for the internal form of KS has displayed it, even patients who had 
the ""traditional"" external form of KS as well.
The HTLV-III blood test now seems virtually worthless.  The Native
reports that a large group of people who scored positive on it
showed negative results when another more reliable & much more 
expensive test for HTLV-III was used.
Furthermore, due to the lack of a guarantee of confidentiality
given to the 200,000 gay men who in good faith participated in
HTLV-III testing a few months ago,  large numbers are justifiably
refusing to be retested & thus seriously jeopardize the study's 
value.  Maybe now the federal medical bureaucracies will begin
to take their hippocratic oaths & professional ethics seriously
(maybe this will even inspire the ACLU or someone else to take
on the barbaric & grossly unconstitutional statutes which pass
for public health law in an epidemic, which few Americans know
anything about).
(So, as many physicians (including Curran of the CDC) advise, DON'T
TAKE THE HTLV-III TEST!!!!!!!  Its signifigance is UNKNOWN, it may
well be WORTHLESS, & leaves one open to serious discrimination &
abuse!  If you think you have symptoms and aren't well, seek a
competent & trustworthy physician (not necessarily easy to do),
PREFERABLY a gay doctor, who's AWARE of gay lifestyles & homopho-
bia; even then, don't automatically have the test: find out first
what if anything it can offer you and how it relates to your com-
plaints.  Marcus Welby is an utter myth!)

[NYNative, 8/29-9/11/83, S. Christopher Hagsch, ""CDC May Be Shaving
Figures"", p. 8]
A source within CDC's AIDS project said AIDS cases figures ""are inaccurate
for many states because Dr. Brandt [Assistant Secretary, Health & Human
Services, HHS] wants it that way.  Less money will be appropriated for
research if the numbers are smaller.""
(Note this is against a background of chronic underfunding of AIDS efforts
even for the most rudimentary projects.)
For example, in July (1983) Tennessee reported 8 confirmed cases, but the
CDC monthly tally claimed 2.  Four of the 8 victims had died as of July!
In June Tennessee reported 5, CDC claimed only 2.  In August, CDC still
claimed only 2 cases!
CDC Public Affairs office spokesperson Chuck Fallis speculated ""I don't
know [what is causing the discrepancy].  My best guess is... a time lag.""
A two-month time-lag, he was asked?  ""I don't know.""
On August 18th the Texas Public Health Dept. reported 62 AIDS cases, but
CDC claimed there were only 47.
CDC credibility was low enough & the discrepancies large enough that
NGTF and Weiss & his HSGOH  said they ""might poll the states"" directly
themselves to find what the actual figures were!
There had been problems from the beginning with CDC reporting: the basic
information (number & distirbution of cases) needed to do any serious
planning or writing of budget proposals to obtain funds was not being 
reliably gathered & reported by CDC, & they revealed little incentive
to obtain the information.

SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson

that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt

are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this
option at all.

(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability to
treat a discussion and its members seriously.  Right now, there is
only one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.
Let's get one thing clear here.  If he acted this way in any other
newsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank.  If he behaved in
public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the

Sour grapes here?  You should abstain from telling people to abstain
& continue the discussion so you can read my posting in the near fu-

a sane & eye-opening review of recent books by gay & straight authors

Shively.
Shively shows how medical & other authorities are effectively reintro-
ducing fear of sex and outright superstition by means of the current
public anxieties over herpes, hepatitis, as well as AIDS, above and
beyond the real risks contained in these diseases.
Many of the books reviewed are being widely read; some are worse than
others.  The best are anthologies of medical papers that have least
bearing on personal health practices.  It's worth reading the review
if you have read or will read any of this literature.","DCC7InLCdFoJ",15,1984-06-12,0,26

I cannot help but feel that there is a subtle ""political"" component in
the AMA article linking certain sexual practices with laboratory immune
deficiency disorders, and extrapolating that to the AIDS syndrome.  A bit
exaggerated, the argument goes as follows:
	""Subjects who participate in generally-considered-icky sexual
	practices show laboratory evidence of immune response to their
	partner's sperm.  Did someone say 'immune'?  Doesn't AIDS have to
	do with the immune system?  Could it be that people who engage in
	such vile practices might actually be bringing it upon themselves?
	Hear ye, and repent now.""
It reminds me a bit of Susan Sontag's expositions of the treatment of
tuberculosis and cancer patients in her book, ""Illness as Metaphor"".  The
chasm between labortatory-level immune system peculiarities and AIDS is
quite wide, especially given the epidemiological evidence which would seem
to implicate an infectious agent as the cause of AIDS.  We must remember
that the accused practice has been around for many millenia, as opposed to
AIDS, which has emerged only in the last three years.  
A similar study was published a few years ago implicating vasectomies in
auto-immune diseases.  In this case, men were showing symptoms of immune
reactions against their own sperm.  Now the researchers (presumably
themselves intact) weren't saying much about vasectomies and AIDS then, but
they were warning of arthritis and heart disease.  The fears stirred up by
that potboiler are only beginning to be dispelled by hard evidence showing
no increase in either disease in vasectomized men.
I should emphasize that I am not condemning basic research of any kind.
But a study's conclusions and presentations are not immune (sorry) to
deeply-ingrained bias.  Here, I'm trying to point out the ur-message
I see hiding beneath the respectable mantle of an AMA article.

emotional impact it had on me.  I was expecting two hours of mindless
Hollywood entertainment.  I was entertained, but moved as well, in
quite surprising ways.
The story concerns a young girl in Eastern Europe at the turn of the
century who wishes to study the Torah.  When her father dies, she runs
off to a distant village, disguising herself as a boy named Anshel so
that she can pursue her studies.  She arrives at a yeshiva and becomes
friends with a fellow student, Avigdor.  The movie's ""schtick"", if you
will, involves the sexual ambiguity inherent in their friendship.
Avigdor treats Anshel as a close confidant, while Yentl finds herself
falling more and more in love with Avigdor, all the time struggling to
keep her feelings under control and unexpressed.  Her love for Avigdor
leads her to do the unthinkable, marrying Avigdor's former fiancee,
that he might stay with them, rather than leave their village.
The metaphor, of course, is the issue of unexpressed, unexpressable,
and unrequited love, something that many gay people have confronted,
especially in their adolescence.  The remarkable thing is how true the
situations in the movie resonate, despite the fact that they are
ultimately couched in a heterosexual ethos.  For myself, I thought I
had buried my adolescent crushes and emotions a decade ago, yet
""Yentl"" dragged them all up to the surface.  I re-experienced along
with Anshel/Yentl the sweet pain and sorrow of loving someone yet
daring not express it.  Which is not to say that the movie was
unenjoyable (especially with Mandy Patinkin as Avigdor!)--merely, like
any good drama, the emotions it brings up are purged and resolved, as
it reaches its conclusion.
I've spoken to several friends since then, many of whom report the
same reactions.  A couple of gay people who've come out rather late in
life haven't felt this way.  I think that the reviewers who gave
""Yentl"" a fair-to-middling review were oblivious to this theme.  I
urge anyone who wants to (re)experience what it's like to love
someone, yet be restrained from expressing it, both by yourself and by
society, to see this movie.
I also posted a more conventional review of ""Yentl"" to 'net.movies'.
It isn't a perfect movie by any means, yet any movie that can shake me
out of my torpor, and make me feel real emotions, and make me trust
it despite all its failings, is a movie I have to recommend.

I've fallen into this class.  It's a grey area as to what is harassing,
but it is almost certain that if someone tells you that you are harassing
them, and you continue to do it, that you are harassing them.

What about the new strains of DDT-resistant insects which have sprung
virtually from nowhere in the last several years?
What about penicillin-resistant gonorrhea?  It was unheard-of until the
1960's.
What about totally new diseases, such as AIDS?  If it didn't evolve
from other microorganisms, do creationists maintain that God recently
created this disease?  If so, why?

It might if it were true, but if anything the moon is moving steadily
closer to the earth.
	""Leading evolutionists are aware of problems with the theory of
	evolution, but are suppressing contradictory evidence.""
Did the lecturer present any evidence, or was he just slandering the
community of scientists?
None of these points are as cut-and-dried as they are presented.  For
example, the fact that one can create a mathematical model ""proving""
creationism to challenge a model ""proving"" evolution simply
demonstrates that you can make a mathematical model to support any
non-trivial assertion.  The evidence that dating techniques are invalid
fall apart in the face of application of the properties of exponential
series.  And claims that historical changes in the speed of light are
sufficient to explain Doppler shifts are simply laughable.
But what else is this newgroup for but to preach to the converted?
