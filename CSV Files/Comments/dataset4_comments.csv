Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against

there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

Sure, and it also affects birdwatchers, and unix-wizards, and people
who watch tv, and pretty much everyone who reads any group on the
net.  That doesn't mean it should be posted to every group there is!
AIDS is a medical problem and belongs in net.med.  Period.
Those interested in reading information about AIDS may subscribe
to net.med.  Those interested in whatever net.women is doing these days
(I gave up on net.women a while back due to a poor S/N ratio) but
not interested in AIDS shouldn't have to wade through a bunch of
AIDS articles.
Taking your thinking to it's logical conclusion, there would be
one newsgroup.  What a mess.  Usenet is collapsing under it's own
weight, and posting articles to umpty-zillion newsgroups isn't
helping.

hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the

One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now

The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and

virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I've exerpted the parts of this guy's posting which make the most sense
responding to, inasmuchas most of it reads like an acute panic reaction to
a diagnosis of genital herpes.  A couple of points of clarification:
chickenpox and shingles are both caused by herpes zoster, and not by the
herpes simplex viruses.  Also, there are no human cancers which are yet
proven to be caused by a virus, with the possible exception of AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma, but the mechanism of the development of KS in people with
AIDS is still unelucidated.  The ""noises"" about viral contributions to
other diseases such as MS and juvenile diabetes are actually early leaks of
scientific investigation in progress, so it is simply silly to claim that
the ""medical profession doesn't care.""
He also betrays a rather peculiar attitude towards those who practice
medicine, as if they were selling something ""guaranteed"", rather than the
unfortunate truth even in this day and age, namely, that they are people
who try to use their limited knowledge to help people get well, or barring
that, remain as comfortable as possible.  Research is always trying to
expand the horizon of what is known so that it can be safely and
effectively applied in medical care, but there will always be gaps in our
knowledge.  ""Acute embarassment?"" Hardly--there is no reason whatsoever to
be embarassed.  Frustrated and challenged, maybe.
As he says, viruses are a particularly difficult nut to crack, because
their actions are intimately tied up with the ordinary expression of
genetic information in the cell; they don't really ""live"" on their own, so
it is much harder to discover and produce the kinds of ""magic bullets""
which have been the hallmark of modern therapy for other infectious
diseases.  Also, the herpes viruses seem to hide very well from the body's
immune system by residing in the spinal ganglia inbetween flareups.  But
there have been a number of effective drugs introduced in the last 15 years
which have anti-viral activity in very specific situations: idoxuridine in
corneal herpes simplex, vidarabine in corneal herpes and herpes simplex
encephalitis, and most recently, acyclovir for these indications and the
symptomatic treatment of genital herpes as well.  Amantadine is effective
in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A infection, and we can expect
more progress on these fronts as research continues.  No one promised it
would be easy.

the nervous system.  Your friend was probably treated immediately after
the bite with rabies antiserum followed by a three weeks of daily vaccine
injections.  The whole point of this aggressive treatment is to neutralize
any rabies virus through the use of antiserum (made from horses, I think)
and to then cause the production of one's own antibodies through vaccination.
Your friend (luckily) never had rabies, and was never ""cured"" of it.

The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

Medical opinion considers that these vectors may enhance the

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

AIDS, NPR's ""All Things Considered"" tonight told of an inmate in a
Kansas City prison who's being kept in isolation merely because he
tested positive to HTLV-III!  The prisoner is in effect serving a
sentence he wasn't given, ie, one of solitary confinement.  The rationale
is, even if the prisoner never develops AIDS (he doesn't even show signs
of ARC), he might still be capable of transmitting the virus to another
who could subsequently come down with full-blown AIDS.  The warden added
an even lamer excuse: he was protecting said prisoner against the violent
reactions of other prisoners who fear AIDS.
Considering that 1/3 of all prisoners have a history of drug use and
addiction, that homosexual acts and rape are common in American prisons,
it's clear many prisoners in every prison probably are infected with the
AIDS virus, which makes the above inmate's isolation incredibly hypocri-
tical.  The real danger is not his probable infection but the mere public
knowledge of it.  
Convicted criminals (he's in on a heroin charge) may forfeit many basic
civil rights & liberties, but not all, & not their fundamental, or ""human""
rights (to life, to be free of torture, etc.).  Nonprisoners would never 
tolerate such treatment.  The difference seems to be power: American gays
now have a fairly powerful political movement and other institutions
to protect their interests; prisoners have none.  So much for the alleged
basic decency or even lawfulness of the ""authorities""!  What holds them
in check apparently is simply countervailing power.
The ACLU is looking into the Kansas City case.

I have some Gay friends who have been arrested in Toronto Ontario.  When word

public criticism.  We'd take any similar statements about other groups
as simply vulgar and an indication that the poster had problems which

responded except Bill that this is the prevailing sentiment here.  It's
a little unclear to me why Bill cites three articles on evil/bad sexual
practice, because the offensive part of Friedman's article was PRECISELY
because he expressed a dislike for the book's um, orientation, and not
because he felt that specific acts were evil or immoral.  How SHOULD someone

There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against

there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

This past year, my lover and I got to know a visiting scholar who was
bisexual--he was using his stay in the U.S. to explore his gay interests
for the first time.  He is married, and has children.  Apparently he was
aware of his feelings toward men for a long time, and finally decided that
he had a choice of going crazy or actually acting on his desires.  He was a
card-carrying bisexual, because he was still attracted to women and was
having great sex with his wife all this time.
At least in his situation, it seemed to me to be a terrible problem--his
wife knew absolutely nothing about this, and he had no intention of telling
her anything, as much from fear about her reaction as from obstinacy.  He
LOVED his kids and didn't want to do anything which might have any risk of
a separation.  Thus, he often resorted to ""affair"" behavior, lying to her
about where he'd be going or who he'd be seeing if it was at ALL
gay-related, not simply sexual.  We often felt like the ""other couple"", as
it were, since we were being lied about, if not actually lying ourselves.
It was the duplicity that bothered me so much--a relationship is built
on trust, and it hurt me to see his wife being deceived regularly.
Bisexuality is fine if the spouse knows about it, and they have dealt
with the issues of monogamy and jealousy, but that surely wasn't the
case here.  I cannot stand too harshly in judgement of him; here was a
person who had wrestled with a very painful personal issue, and was
attempting some kind of compromise which allowed him to continue to
keep the various parts of his life in a precarious balance.

I don't really understand point #1.  Unless one assumes that relationships
will be stereotypical, the pressure to choose between gay and straight is
simply pressure to choose (or not) between different individuals, i.e.
pressure to choose between monogamy or not.  I think that if one is not
satisfied with either the ""gay"" or ""straight"" life, then maybe this simply
means that one is not satisfied with the individuals that have come to
represent this life.
I don't think that my life would be THAT different if my partner was a
woman rather than a man.  I'd have new worries: being accepted by society,
how to have children.  I'd also be rid of certain other worries: birth
control, wondering whether inequalities in our relationship are sex-based.
I think that the main difference in the relationship would be because I'd
be with a different person rather than with a person of a different sex.
One would hope that most of the joys and struggles inherent in a relationship
have more to do with the personalities of the people involved than with
their sexes.
This discussion in net.motss puzzles me somewhat.  How easily factionalised
people can become!  one would think, that since homosexuals have had such
a hard time explaining to heterosexuals that *really* people are pretty
much the same, no matter what their sexual orientation is, that they would
apply this reasonning to another group of people with a different sexual
orientation.  Yet I hear some claims of not ""trusting"" bisexuals, of
bisexuals being in both ""camps"".  Not trusting what?  what camps are we
talking about?  is there a war going on here between homosexuals and
heterosexuals with bisexuals as double-spies?  is that what love is all
about for some of you?  give us a break!

Both are disliked by certain people, but not because of their dictionary
meaning.  ""Negro"", after all, is a simple cognate via Spanish of the Latin,
""black"", but its relative disuse these days comes from its association with
its earlier use by non-blacks in an overwhelmingly racist society.  In the
same way, the word ""homosexual"", aside from its offensiveness to linguists,
being an unwieldly juxtaposition of Greek and Latin stems, is a relic of
late 19th century attitudes about human sexuality.  It has a rather stodgy,
dusty clinicalness about it which is inappropriate for everyday use.  You might
not mind being called ""heterosexual"" when the occasion calls for it (as in
the rare case to identify someone as NOT-""homosexual""), but gay people end
up living with the term all day long.
There seems nothing wrong with calling people the way they wish being
called.  ""Black"" has replaced ""negro"" in most American English, and
""gay"" for ""homosexual"" is making inroads.

Since being a homosexual is defined as a negative thing by many people,  it
would   be  surprising  if  the  word  ""homosexual""  didn't  have  negative
connotations associated with it.  On the other hand,  connotations  are  in
the eye (ear?) of the beholder, by definition.
I think ""Nazi"" originally stood for National Socialist Party (in German).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

Back then, these places were opportunities which most people
wouldn't touch.  Having a bit more disposable income than a
typical family (no kids, you see) and a bit more spare time,
they worked to shape their environments into their image of

Today's young, professional straight couples actually have a lot in common
with gay couples: they are putting off having families, have become
more sophisticated in their tastes, and have the money to indulge them.
There's not much difference there, except sexual preference!  Some

Probably thrown out once the sociological evidence began to be considered.
Though there are a great many gay people to be found in urban settings,
many have moved to the city from suburban or rural areas as a consequence
the greater opportunities and illusion of tolerance (q.v. Ron Rizzo's
article.)  Simply put, there don't seem to be more gay people born per
capita in, say, New York City than in all of New York state.
This ""population density stress"" theory comes, if I'm not mistaken, from
the experimental studies made with rats and overcrowding, where one
observed lordosis and copulative behavior between same-sex pairs of
rats.  Of course, one also noticed cannibalism and other aberrations;
why one would choose to link these highly artificial results with
the behavior of gay people is an interesting study in the sociology
of scientific research.
It's worth asking one more time what attitudes lie behind the question

There is some evidence that placing pregnant women under stress leads to  a
higher  incidence  of  homosexuality  in  their  offspring.  It  seems that
there's a higher incidence of homosexuality among people who were  born  in
Germany  during WWII when their mothers were exposed to the stress of being
on the wrong end of bombing raids.
_If_ the above is true, it suggests a  chemical/hormonal  mechanism  rather
than a learned response or genetic cause.

less.  I don't encourage participation in this kind of wool-gathering
unless it's to reveal how drenched in social attitudes it is.
The problem goes fairly deep.  The wrong questions are being posed.
Sophie Quigley's right when she says that on the face of things the
most problematic fact is why do there appear to be so many heterosexuals?
All of the hypotheses put forward to ""explain"" homosexuality (prenatal
stress, recessive genes, etc.)
are invidious ones containing an implicit idea of homosexuality as an
exception or deviation from a norm of nature, even if no moral or psycho-
logical censure is intended.  Even the seeming accident of the pun in
the phrase ""recessive gene"" is not entirely unrelated to the bias that
motivates the kind of questions that netters have asked.
The issues you choose to discuss and the terms in which they're discussed
are important, apart from any considerations of how rational, inspired,
or conscientious the discussion is.  It may seem silly to netters for us
to criticize this seemingly harmless, even well-intended discussion, but 
the kind of more subtle & indirect reinforcement of attitudes that occurs
by the choice of topic & its treatment is probably as important as the more
explicit & direct kind.  For example, I've come to believe that debates
about homosexuality hinging on sexual practices or gender roles probably
keep alive stereotypes as much as they promise to dispel them.
I don't mean to say stop talking about the topic, but only to urge people
to make a real effort to be aware, of the topic, their opinions, themselves
& the environment.  The biology invoked so far could stand improvement; it's
suffered probably because a social issue's involved.

Well, blacks have nowhere near made up from the the effects of the
discrimination against them, they are still paying in that their
unemployment is higher, for example.  Neither have gays, except
perhaps arround the major gay centers like LA, NYC, and SF.  Even
in these ""Mecca's"" one is more likely to be killed or have other
""personal"" crimes (as opposed to purely ""property"" crimes) committed
against one.  I agree that (skin color/sexual orientation/religion/
marital status/sex) shouldn't make any difference, but untill everyone 
agrees on that fact, it does make a difference.

Or another way of putting it is to change every ""gay"" in your above

I don't either.

""Vegetarian M seeks same to share apartment...""
or maybe
""Non-smoker seeks same, M or F to share house...""
or maybe
""Roommate wanted, no pets.""

""Christians sought to share communal fellowship...""
Of course not.  It is no less appropriate to identify oneself as gay
or specify that one is looking for a gay roommate.  This prescreens
the audience.  Homophobic straight people or those who are simply
uncomfortable need not apply.  As for the potential for harassment,
it depends on the enviroment--I am sure Robert has taken that into
account (and in any event, at least in the New England high-tech
professional corridor, it doesn't appear to be an issue.)  Her attempt
to demean the desire to to live with compatible people, with her neo-
liberal ""why should it be an issue at all?"" is a slap in the face to
gay people.
When the new age arrives, I'm sure it won't be a big issue anymore
to have to state one's sexual preference in a roommate ad.  But until
that comes, the fact is that many straight people are uncomfortable
dealing with gay people, especially in a roommate situation.  It is
a waste of both parties' time to let an inquiry get as far as a phone
call.  Better to let everyone know up-front.

Sounds like my response to Evelyn pressed one of Tim's pre-programmed
buttons.  I would save the tirade against religion for another more
appropriate newsgroup.  What *IS* true in the context of this discussion
is that a personal characteristic such as sexual orientation is as
legitimate a discriminant when making a housing choice as vegetarianism,
gender, smoking, keeping kosher, liking loud music, or even (gasp) religion,
if one cared enough about it.
There is nothing illegal about an individual making private decisions
about whom they wish to live with or associate with.  Some of those
might be repugnant to some (discrimination based on race or religion),
others morally neutral.  I am thankful, however, that we don't have
the government that Tim thinks we have, where individual ""right
thinking"" and ""right behavior"" are legislated.  To belabor the
obvious, I am not addressing discrimination by public and private
*institutions*, nor the moral illegitimacy of such discrimination.
More than anything else, I am appalled at the more general controversy
(raised entirely by straights here) who would claim that explicitly
seeking a gay roommate is not only a non-issue but actually morally
wrong!  They of course would not think twice about using any of the
issues mentioned above as criteria in choosing friends, roommates
and lovers.

of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

sample size - 14 gay men is not a very large population, and the
	      number of gay men who actually demonstrated an 
	      exceptional reaction to the administration of
	      estrogen was smaller--9 is the figure I remember.

	      which could have a large effect on hormonal
	      responses.  Given the population from which they
	      selected their subjects (gay bars in urban
	      settings) this is worrysome.
selection   - There were no gay women in the study, a glaring
	      omission explained away, rather lamely, by the
	      researchers asserting that they couldn't find any
	      gay women (sounds like they weren't asking the
	      right people.)  Certainly, a demonstrable difference
	      from the baseline by gay people of both sexes
	      would have strengthened any conclusions they
	      might make.
As someone trained as a scientist, I am fascinated by basic research, but
it is also useful to remember the political and social contexts in which
scientific research, however ""pure"", operates.  Where might we go from
here?  Suppose that one's primary sexual orientation is linked to the
morphology of certain brain structures, that these structures differ from
the norm in people with an affinity for the same sex, and that it is shown
that hormonal changes in the mother during fetal development influence the
ultimate morphology of the child's brain, and thus exerts a strong
influence on the child's sexual preference?  This is not too far-fetched
a theory, and the experiment mentioned above is a first step in data
collection.
What is thought to be benign, or even benevolent, individual variance in one
culture, or at some point in time, may be considered ""bad"", ""evil"", or a
problem, in other cultures, or at other points in time.  Unfortunately, if
society finds a ""cause"" for a event which is considered a problem, it
immediately suggests the existence of a ""cure.""  For comparison, look at the
attitudes of Victorian society towards masturbation and many of the often
hilarious, and sometimes chilling ""cures"" for this ""affliction.""  Though the
strides of the gay rights movement in the past 15 years are well-recognized,
I think it is safe to claim that there is a very very long way to go, and
that same-sex sexual orientation is still classified by many as a ""problem.""
Even if one feels that a purely biological view of sexual behavior is
hopelessly reductive and unprofitable when taken out of the laboratory, many
will grasp at anything blessed with the imprimatur of ""science"" and use it in
the formulation of policy.
Let's examine the possible ""cures"" which might result if this research
in the biological bases of sexual preference bore fruit:
- during pregnancy, a woman is noted to have the hormonal changes which
  predispose her child to homosexual behavior (surely a simple home
  screening test of blood, urine or salive might be prepared.)  She
  decides to have an abortion on the basis of this finding.
- a woman with a previous history of this hormonal variance is treated by
  her gynecologist to ensure that this does not occur during her next
  pregnancy.
- a child is born, the mother was notified of this hormonal variation
  during her pregnancy, and it is noted on the child's medical record.
  What effect will this have on the parents in their care and raising of
  the child, given the societal mores which indicate this is a significant
  enough problem that it should be measured at all?  What effect will this
  biological ""marker"", or Scarlet Letter, have on the child's own self-
  esteem, integration into society and ultimate sexual behavior?
The issue here is not scientific knowledge or technology, but their use as
tools to implement what society feels is ""good"", often to the detriment of
individual variation and freedom.  It is incumbent upon people to speak
against such goals when they are voiced, to question their underlying
assumptions, and to continue the goal of education, to help persuade people
otherwise when they describe same-sex sexual orientation as a ""problem""
which needs to be cured.

response.  In any event, you didn't understand my point at all, which
wasn't an attack on abortion rights, nor a plea to avoid scientific
investigation.  One needn't have to question the rights of women to have
abortions if one is to examine societal mores, their effects on individual
decisions, and the subsequent cumulative effect of these decisions on
society.  The fact that one of my examples used an abortion was simply
reflecting reality, since that would doubtlessly be one approach towards
solving the ""problem"" of having a child who had a good chance of turning
out gay.
Since the gay topic seems to be a red flag of sorts, let's examine the
situation that you use to buttress your replies: the ability for parents
these days to choose the sex of their child.  Some feminists are becoming
concerned by this, because overall, boys are preferred to girls.  Let's say
that this choice became the norm, and with the result of all these
cumulative decisions on the sex of a child, we begin to see a significant
shift in the sex ratio of births in the U.S., and a resulting change in
demographics.  Is it not appropriate for those concerned to speak out about
this, to ask people to examine the underlying reasons for their choices, to
ask what this says about ""male"" and ""female"" in our society?  Doesn't this
present an enormous educational problem to those who disagree with this
trend?  Isn't it appropriate to discuss this BEFORE it becomes reality?
I submit that the analogous situation with gay people is even more
disturbing and more likely, and homophobia armed with biological means
could easily lead towards the eradication of gay people, or more likely,
to make a minority even smaller, to vitiate its power and presence in
society, and to contribute towards the homogenization of society by
removing those who are not like the majority.
Your comment comparing finding the ""marker"" for homosexuality before or at
birth with knowing the sex of the child makes sense only in a world without
sexism and homophobia.  My comments reflected the situation of someone
born in a world which is fearful enough of homosexuality that it finds it
necessary to measure it during pregnancy.

Gordon, a couple of points: you are knocking down an argument which was
being assumed for the purposes of this thought experiment, so it isn't
strictly relevant.  That is, the reasoning goes this way:
1.) IF (big if) researchers found morphological differences between
    straight and gay people
2.) and IF they found the situation responsible for this difference
    (to name a few: genes, hormonal variance in utero, during
    childhood, whatever--it isn't important to the argument)
3.) wouldn't it be possible or even very likely that society would
    find a ""cure"" for the situation.
You forget, too, that something can be biologically based without
being hereditary.  Perhaps the Kinsey continuum of 1 (entirely
heterosexual) to 6 (entirely homosexual) is based on the level of
certain hormones during pregnancy, and that the natural variation
and fluxuation in all women ""causes"" the continuum.  Now, stepping
outside this discussion, I entirely agree with you, but that's not my
point.

I wasn't arguing against research.  I wasn't arguing against this particular
research.  I think it's fascinating.  Really.  What I was asserting is that
the results of any research can be misused.  We all know this, just look at
the bomb.  In this particular situation, I was presenting a thought experiment
of what MIGHT happen, given the history of our society and assuming that
current attitudes about gay people don't change significantly, and assuming
that a particularly reductive view of sexual preference gains evidence.
The points I make now will have to be made soon IF (big if) science can
ever point to ""causes"" for homosexual behavior.  It is important to get
people thinking EARLY about the consequences of technology and how it
can be used or misused.

I don't think that Steve is worried about the continuation of gay ""tradition""
but the impact on the gay population that the ease with which homosexuality
could be prevented in utero would have.  Another analogy can be drawn with
these proposed devlopments and the development of other methods to determine
abnorbalities in fetuses.  The reason amniocentecis (sp?) is performed is not
in order to cure potentially ""damaged"" fetuses in utero, but rather to give
parents of such fetuses the opportunity to have an abortion.  Now, of course,
retardation, birth deffects, etc, will never be erradicated, but if it becomes
a common practice to ""cure"" such problems by abortion, then society will
probably be less compassionate towards people who refuse the ""cure"" and their
offsprings.  This issue is apparently causing great concern in groups for
disabled people.
While I am certainly not in favour of restricting women's right to abortion
for any reason (and anybody who reads net.abortion can attest to this)  I am
worried about the impact of the widespread acceptance of abortion of deformed
fetuses.  Like many of the pro-lifers, I too am worried that people might
abort problem fetuses just because there are no societal structures in place
to support disabled people.  And it is a vicious circle: it becomes easier
to abort those fetuses rather than accept them into our society, and as there
are less and less of them, the ones that are there are not as easily accepted
or can even be blamed (or their parents can be) for existing in the first
place, and thus refused assistance that they might have been given if they
were a more visible minority.
I think there is a parallel with this situation and the problem of ""detecting""
people's homosexuality in advance.  If homosexuality is seen as undesirable,
and can be detected earlier on, and people can ""cure"" it by aborting would-be
homosexuals,  and this becomes common-place, then existing homosexuals will
certainly not be tolerated as well by society.

That is all a matter of opinion!  One possible side-effect of drastic
changes in male/female ratios would be an increase in homosexuality so
it is all related.
****** FLAME ON ******
How can you DARE say that the problems that heterosexual people might
have in finding mates might be more ""serious"" than problems homosexuals might
encounter because of discrimination!  Seems to me that food & shelter
are much more basic needs than sex and companionship.
This kind of attitude really pisses me off!!!!  I find it SOOOOO reminiscent
of the usual crap that men used to feed women about how men's worries were
so much more ""serious"" than women's worries, and how men's work was so much
more ""serious"" than women's work...  etc.. ad infinitum.  And usually in
this kind of situation, the truth was that those who were concerned about
""seriousness"" could afford to do so because they had free time on their hands
unlike those who were spending all their lives working at less ""serious""
tasks such as making sure that their families did not starve.
Your attitude is so patronising, it is disgusting!  Just because a concern
is not yours, then immediately it is less serious, and just because a
concern is shared by a majority of people, then it happens to be more
serious then other concerns minorities might have.  Yes, I bet there are
more people in the world who are worried about sex than there are who are
starving (or are things worse than I think they are?).  I guess that makes
the problems of the starving people less ""serious"" too by your definition.

which goes far beyond matters of biological gender or cultural
gender role.  This is not to deny that sexual orientation is a
profound facet of personality, perhaps as permanent as any other
facet (any personal trait can be changed; after all, torture
works), & as valid.  This is also not to ignore a lot of data
which suggest that most people are predominantly gay or straight
in North America, with a smaller middle group of bisexuals, or
to rule out in advance biological factors which may at least 
partly underlie this fact.  However, much of the discussion of
candidate biological factors that I've seen is mired in gender
stereotypes often peculiar to North America.
Sexual orientation is problematic, in all its variety.  Eg, why
are there heterosexuals at all?  The darwinian sketches of an
explanation I've heard seem meager, ad hoc, & not very confid-
ently advanced.
I think it's time (is net.motss the place?) to open a possible
pandora's box by making the case for homosexuality (& hetero-
sexuality, too?  I see ""procreation"" lingering like a ghost
around most people's attitudes toward it) as a matter of totally
voluntary choice.  I should seek out not only sexual but emotional
relationships with people of the same sex (or the opposite sex)
simply because I WANT TO, FEEL LIKE DOING SO, & to HELL with any
other justification!  & society, law, etc. should SUPPORT these
choices as they have those of hetero-not-too-sexual monogamy cum
marriage.
(I assume most readers of net.motss understand ""orientation vs.
preference"" and don't entertain the silly notions of homosexuality
implicit in American homophobia -- that it's temporary, a result
of peculiar formative influences, pseudo-feminity/masculinity etc.
I also assume readers don't regard heterosexuality as god-given,

I'll bite.  Given that the homosexual (it could also be any person,
Christian, Jew, Moslem, Atheist, Bahai, heterosexual or any-other-sexual
you can imagine) does not disrupt work by bringing their personal
ideosyncracies into the workplace, then they should win the suit.
Simple enough?
The funny thing, Brunson, is that you probably have non-heterosexuals
(interesting word) working for you now, or will have them working
for you in the future and you won't know it.  I'd also guess that
there are lots of people you'd refuse to hire thinking they were gay
who, in fact, are not.  It's ironic that you aren't discriminating
on the basis of sexual preference, but on the basis of honesty.
(Unless, of course, you're given to creeping and peeping around
folks bedrooms at night in which case you are definitely due for
a spell in the slammer.)

To answer your question, the person who refuses to hire homosexuals
should lose, and the homosexual should win.  ""Should"" means that, in
my opinion, this is what I believe is more just.
The problem is that the employer wishes to hire only people who he/she is
comfortable having around, while the person looking for work wishes to
have access to any job based only on their ability, not the personal
preferences of the employer.  I believe that it is more important for
the employee to be protected from discrimination than it is for the
employer to be allowed to discriminate.

If quoting random statistics and journals is to be thought of as evidence
of intelligence (or as evidence of having something reasonable to say), then
it's no wonder certain people get elected to high office.  Arndt may be
""flashy"" in that he shows people the TRAPPINGS of intelligence and reason,

he actually has something important to say, then perhaps he's well suited to
go into advertising (or more likely propaganda).  Don't let people like Arndt
or Brunson or Bickford snow you.  Look what the Germans got when they fell for
it.  Look what we're getting.
If they produce random quotings of ""authorities"" instead of facts, if
they can't justify their own requests for justification by others, if the
sum and total of all their logic is a ridiculous emotional appeal designed to
make you believe notions that have no logical basis in fact, then just ignore
them.  Or else point them out for what they are.

6th.  It's addressed to all voters who think they may vote for Reagan,
but especially to closet Republicans, [Ll]ibertarians, and gay people.
(The views expressed herein are my own, & not those of my employer.)
To my mind the foremost reason for not reinstating Ronnie is his
inveterate homophobia.  I wish to dissuade voters who entertain
any of the following notions:
1) Reagan is personally a Nice Guy, free of prejudice himself, but
   politically allied with conspicuous homophobes, whom he ignores
   or tries to contain;
2) Reagan's a bigot, but also a staunch defender of privacy and
   unhampered free enterprise; this, say Libertarians, makes
   civil rights laws redundant & unnecessary (& obnoxious);
3) Reagan is a nasty idiot, who can't tell an ""individual right""
   from a hole-in-the-wall, but the direction or EFFECT of his
   administration is beneficial.  No matter how dreadful specific
   Reagan policies, programs, or appointees are, a net good must
   result.
In defense of 1)-3), one could cite two actions:
-- In 1978, in his newspaper column, Reagan was the first major
   California politician to publically oppose the Briggs Initia-
   tive (which would have allowed local school boards to dismiss
   teachers ""advocating sexual lifestyle"", a phrase which was left
   undefined).  Reagan was out of office then, with no constituents
   to answer to; opposition to the Initiative didn't necessarily
   imply tolerance, but rather a desire not to undercut teachers' 
   authority & most educational and teachers' organizations had 
   already come out publically against the initiative (with an
   eye to his political future, Reagan may've wished to conciliate(?)
   California educators, whom he'd utterly alienated as governor
   by making godawful John Bircher Max Rafferty education czar).
-- It is said (this isn't more than a rather pious rumor) that Reagan
   helped to kill Roger Jepsen's bizarre Family Protection Act by in-
   action, etc.
(A third matter, Terry Dolan's giving THE ADVOCATE, a gay biweekly, 
an interview 2 years ago, for which he caught a lot of flak from 
other Reagan supporters, is in the realm of PR, a pretty shaky 
basis for a belief in Reagan's tolerance).
The truth is that appeal to antihomosexual bigotry has been a staple
of Reagan's political career from its very outset.  In 1967 he cam-
paigned for governor of California largely by obsessively charging
that the University of California at Berkeley was a ""hotbed of homo-
sexuality & communism"".  This ""queer smear"" derived entirely from a
nonviolent & rather minor campus controversy:  the editor-in-chief of
the undergraduate paper, The Daily Califorian, had published a series
of articles on homosexuals in the Bay Area.  The series was done in
an objective, social-scientific vein (the editor was a sociology major).
University regents, as timid as ever, ousted him from the editorship,
but the student senate (I think) reinstated him.  Big deal.  Apparently
Reagan thought it was, especially for his political ambitions: he won 
the election.
In 1967 no New Right existed, and the far right had virtually no power
or influence, even locally.  Reagan could not have then been the poli-
tical captive of militantly homophobic supporters.  Altho' fagbaiting
is a venerable tradition in American politics, usually employed in the
desperate final days of a losing campaign to slander opponents by innu-
endo, few politicians have made the blatant, indiscriminate, repeated,
& lengthy use of it that Ronald Reagan has.

What gives any belief system (or any group of adherents to a belief
system) the right to ""denormalize""/outlaw/prohibit any set of behaviors
that doesn't interfere with or harm other human beings?  If anybody
has that ""right"" now, it's a right worth taking away.

If the prison system had the means to truly psychologically rehabilitate
rapists/murderers/ALL those who feel they have some sort of right to
interfere in other people's lives, then ""protection"" for such
rehabilitated people would be warranted, NOT to allow them to re-engage
in their anti-human activities, but rather to live their lives in peace.
What anti-human activities are homosexuals guilty of?  (By the way, I
thought ""gay"" was used not to make things more ""palatable"" for those
like you---it hasn't and it won't---but rather as a self-descriptive term
to provide a positive self-image for gay people, as opposed to the malicious
and/or more clinical terms.)

I assume the author is referring to his own vindictive arbitrary hatred.
Disgust is in the eye of the beholder.  What give such beholders the right
to impose behavior standards on beholdees?  And, if nature is ""what happens
in the real world"", how can anything that actually happens be a perversion
of nature?  Or are only one person's specific views on what is ""natural"" the
basis for guidelines?

	First, I would much rather do my own thinking than have
God do my thinking for me.
	Second, if people have the freedom to do what they want,
why are you so concerned about what they do?  As long as they are
not trying to force their views upon you, they should be free to
do as they wish.  As a gay male, and as a person of color, I
don't believe that because I am gay (or Black), I have a 'right'
to certain things.  However, I do believe that as an American, I
have a 'right' to freedom of association, job opportunity, etc.
	Finally, I invite you to elaborate on the 'societal
impact' of not viewing homosexuality as a sin.
	Oh yeah, almost forgot.  I plan to vote for Reagan.

        I have to disagree with your last  statement.  There
are instances where homosexual activity has been observed in
the  animal  kingdom.   There  were  some  articles  in  net
religion  about  it  last year.  I am trying to look them up
for you.  My real point, however, is that it does happen  in
animals  as  well  as people.  If that be the case, then you
cannot call it a ""perversion of nature.""

Fine.  Now, explain to us why you feel your positions are valid, why
people's rights to have the sexuality of their own choosing, the
beliefs of their own choosing, etc., are not ""truly legitimate causes"".
(I think asking for a logical reason behind a position is the quickest
way to silence those who have nothing to say.)
As I've tried to say before, one fights for the rights of a group
oppressed for no good reason, NOT because one wants to ""liberate"" a
particular group, but rather because one wants to make sure that
groups and individuals of any kind will no longer be oppressed for
any reason.  As such, the fact that people seem to have to fight for
these things anew with each generation is the real ""slap in the face""
of the aforementioned people.
(Of course, that's why social reformers of the '60s are the YUPPIES of
today, who find it no longer appropriate to fight for the personal freedoms
of others because they've gotten theirs---along with their Cuisinarts...  )

	Yeah, I suppose it is.  Conversely, it is possible for straights
to renounce their heterosexuality (some religious nuns, priests, brothers,
etc. do this on a regular basis).  Does this renunciation of their sexual
nature make them any less heterosexual??  I don't think so.
	As for an employer's right to treat homosexuality as an
""objectionable behavior,"" it seems to me that he should only treat
this as an objectionable behavior **IF IT INTERFERES WITH THE
EMPLOYEE'S PRODUCTIVITY**!  Many straight couples have marriage
problems, and this is often considered an ""objectionable behavior""
by many groups.  Nevertheless, the employer is not involved unless

an employee, a Mr. Brunson, without adequate reason.  Can you explain?""
""Sure, always glad to help the government!  Mr. Brunson practices

This is not the issue, by your own example.  What we are talking about
is essential civil rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and upheld
by the supreme court.  There are lots of people in this world whose
activities I dislike;  Nazis, Moonies, prostelytizing right-wing Chris-
tians, wife-beaters, people who rip articles out of library periodicals,
jaywalkers, creationists, trekkies and people who post to multiple
newsgroups to name a few.  It is my right to dislike them, but it is
not my right to abridge their rights as members of this society because
of that dislike.
I don't believe anyone, but you, is talking about giving gays
""protected minority"" status in the legal sense of the word.  Minority
quotas, contract obligations and so forth are *your* Phyllis Shlaflyisms
designed to conjure meaningless spectres in others minds.  A lie is
a lie not only when it is about fact, but when it is about potential.

I must confess ignorance here.  I must say that it would do my heart

An interesting issue arises from the fundamentalists' concentration
upon ""homosexual behavior"".  If a gay person doesn't have sex with

strongly ""Yes.""  When you get right down to it, ""homosexual behavior""
in the Kinsey/M&J sense is really a small part of life (for most of

another man.  Rather, a large component of gay life revolves around
life with one's SO and the friendships and acquaintanceships one forms
day-to-day.  (Just like everyone else; the fate of net.motss is to
constantly rehash the obvious.)  Indeed, though I would not prefer it
for myself, it is entirely possible to be celibate and gay.  Where do
these people stand before the fundamentalist judge (hmmn, do I mean
God or Brunson?  Brunson, of course, since it's well known that God
isn't a fundamentalist!)
Finally, how would Brunson know if he were selling his house to

so, ..."".  Neither do I believe that homosexuals should be a
""protected"" (whatever that means) minority.  If you start saying
that 10% of all jobs should go to gays/women/people of
color/whatever, you have just about guaranteed that NO MORE THAN
10% of all jobs will go to gays/women/people of color/whatever. 
	My proposition is that race, color, sexual orientation or
preference, creed, etc.  should be TOTALLY IRRELEVANT in dealing
with another person.    One should only be concerned with
another's ability.

By ignoring the latter group completely, since there is no reason why
a group who simply believes something to be ""an abomination"" has the
right to impose that view on other people who believe otherwise, and
no reason why they should be ""accommodated"".  As witnessed by their

The ultimate goal of ""civil rights rhetoric"" is to have a world in which
NO ONE is discriminated against for arbitrary malicious reasons (which is
the only type of reason that has been offered).  The ultimate goal is
not to include any group onto a list of ""protected minorities"", but rather
to eradicate malicious discrimination by people who simply don't like
certain classes of people for whatever empty reason.  In a world in which
people continue to behave with the level of consideration for other human
beings that would make Jesus Christ spin in his grave, why shouldn't you
be penalized for your malice towards groups of people who think and behave
differently than you do?

Apparently you also haven't learned the lesson of tolerance from that
book you keep telling the rest of us to read.  All you've gotten out
of it is a springboard for showing your supposedly higher level of
morality by decreeing that all should (must) follow it.

There's no need to protect such people.  If they refuse to offer consideration
to other human beings, why show any special extra consideration to them?
It's just like your examples:  blacks have no choice but to be black, so
you can't blame them for being black (blame them???), so it's wrong to
discriminate against them; on the other hand, homosexuals (and I guess
Jews, too, eh?) choose to be what they are, so it's OK to be intolerant of
them.  By your logic, you choose to be intolerant of other people for no
good reason, thus it's OK to discriminate against you.

Any interviews in which the personal private lives of the interviewees
are discussed are unethical.  People have won lawsuits based on claims
that they were not hired because the interviewer discussed personal or
religious beliefs, et al.  An ethical job interviewer would never concern
him/herself with such matters during an interview.  The rest of your scenario
has already been discussed, pointing out your empty basis for your
discrimination and your contemptible patronizing attitude toward Jews.

And my proposition is that race, color, creeds should be irrelevant,
but not ""being named Brunson"".  Discrimination against persons based on
race or creed is an abomination, but discrimination against people named
Brunson (or those with other aberrant names) is OK.  My proposition is just
as worthy of consideration as yours:  it's equally arbitrary, equally
vacuous.  (By the way, which creeds were you leaving out?  The non-Judaeo/
Christian ones?)

This one isn't (though Arndt and Martillo might argue about my Jewishness).
(At times like this I always recall, and always forget the name of, the
clergyman who said ""First they came for... but I was not... so I didn't speak
up"".  Of course I also forget the text itself.  If someone would be so kind...)
The ""tactic"" being engaged in is YOURS:  the crux of your argument is that
YOU don't like homosexuals, thus you have a right to discriminate against
them.  The word, discrimination, when taken to its logical extreme (as it
often is when it is unchecked), *should* trigger the response you describe
for ANY group being unjustly discriminated against.

I take ""personally harmful"" to mean that YOU judge it to be harmful to
a given individual because YOU find it repugnant.  If you liked eating
chocolate, and I (and others) found that practice repugnant, and
discriminated against you for engaging in it, would that make sense?
(I know, not a good way to phrase a question directed at an Arndt clone.)

The goal of advancing minority rights is NOT to make lists of protected
minorities (""OK, discriminating against blacks, Jews, ... that's wrong because
they fought and paid their dues and are now 'legitimate minorities',  but
discriminating against gays, atheists, people named Brunson, that should be
allowed!""), but rather to ensure that unjust persecution and discrimination
against *any* group of people is agreed upon as WRONG.  It's that simple.

I see.  That is, I see that you have changed the scenario to
give your position more credibility and power.
The point, however, is still  that  you  have  discriminated
against  one person because of his sexual preference and and
for another because of her religious preference.  This makes
for  discrimination on grounds which are illegal.  No matter
what you feel about it you and your business could easily be
liable for prosecution.

Whoa!  Homosexuality does not constitute prima facie evidence for sodomy
nor is sodomy a practice restricted to gays.  Granted that specific forms
of sexual behavior may be against the law and that you have the right to
discriminate against those who break the law, it is incumbent upon *you*
to prove the violation.  Innocence without proof of guilt is a right that
everyone enjoys, fortunately, though it appears you would like to change
that.
(You would be amazed at the sexual practices that are against the law in
North Carolina -- as a monogamous happily married person I regularly violate
state statutes.  Fortunately only Jesse Helms is interested in prosecuting
these sorts of things.)

The title of this article represents the oft-heard rationale of those who
resist social change:  why not leave things as they are?  The corollary to
this occurs in times when social progress is growing, and the changes that
this progress causes requires some adjustment on the part of other people
who formerly didn't have bother thinking about the people their behavior
was affecting.  That corollary is:  why don't we go back to the old ways
when things were better, when everyone knew their place, etc.?
1.  What Brunson calls a warped morality is, in fact, a morality prescribing
	the right of all human beings to live as they please, provided that
	their actions do not interfere with or violate another person's rights.
	Brunson may argue that HIS right to interfere in other people's lives
	is being violated (his right to discriminate).  Yet that is clearly
	not one of the ""rights"" this very simple, minimal and rational morality
	includes.  Is there anyone who finds fault with such a morality?  Why?
2.  If a society is based on the exploitation/oppression/dehumanization/
	ignoring of an element(s) of that society, on some arbitrary basis
	(""They're not human, they're slaves.""  ""They don't believe in the
	REAL god.""  ""They do *weird* things."" ""... thus they can't vote,
	can't expect equal treatment, etc.""), then the sudden/gradual
	realization of the equalness/humanity of that element, that group
	of people, is going to cause changes in the society.  (""You mean
	we won't have slaves to work in our fields anymore?"" ""You mean *they*
	are going to working in *our* company?""  ""You mean I have to work/live
	with/near one of *them*?"", etc.)  If a tenet of the societal morality
	is truly to treat all people equally, even those who formerly were
	not, then the changes are to be expected.  A fact of life.
3.  I'd still like to see the difference between Jews/blacks/women(""legitimate""
	minorities) and homosexuals (non-""legitimate"" minorities).  I'd also
	like to know what Brunson's notion of a protected minority is.  If
	all people are to be treated equally and not discriminated against,
	why are certain groups considered ""protected""?
4.  The battle cry ""let's get things back to the way they were"", an appeal
	to those affected negatively by these changes, is most often a call
	to fascism and repression.  Getting back to the old days will of
	necessity mean getting back to (actively) repressing the newly 
	emancipated groups of people.  Such people are not satisfied until
	they can repress just about everyone other than themselves.  Then there
	are those like that clergyman who said ""First they came for the gays,
	but I was not gay, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the Jews,
	but I was not a Jew, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the
	communists, but I was not a communist, so I didn't speak up; ... then
	they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.""  (BAD
	PARAPHRASE---could someone please send me the original text and the
	name of the speaker)

Actaully, it depends somewhat on how the constitution is interpreted as
to waether or not it is legal to discriminate against anyone!  And I'm glad
to say that those few states that still have sodomy laws are having them
struck down by the courts if they won't get their own house in order.
Currently Texas is in court over the issue.

Your religion should be practiced everywhere, why do you not follow it?
Remember Jesus's ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""?  Why do you not practice
the second most important commandment, according to the benchmark of the
man you try to pattern your life after.

You are a bigot and a hypocrate.  You should not be allowed to let the effects
of the former ruin other people's lives.  You should think about the latter
and ask if Jesus wants his church run on that basis.

        Laziness and/or unintendended ignorance, I guess; it's
much easier to deal with a group as a group than to separately
acknowledge the various sub-groups within the group.  It would be
easy (to use an analogy) to say that 'Black people do this' in
discussing certain behaviors that are practiced almost
exclusively by Black males. 
        Of course, this is not meant to condone the behavior you
describe in any way.  I am aware that the proportion of lesbian
AIDS victims to male homosexual AIDS victims is very low. 
        However, if perhaps the lesbian community were to become
more visible (both to male homosexuals and to heterosexuals),
then this tendency to lump the lesbian community in with the male
homosexual community would decrease.

It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men and
women"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc.  The
linguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words as
pseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language.
Yet one can see the results of this.  Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she""
(unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean just
what the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptions
abound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners.
Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, or
else the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right?
(""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."")  This is why
many people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER,
police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid having
people assume that they refer to males.  Insisting that ""a policeman can
be a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (even
subconsciously) to mean policeMAN.  Notice that even a word like homosexual
(which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) gets
interpreted to mean ""male homosexual"".  (Thus it may not be just in
particular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions that
if no gender is specified, we're talking about males.)
Also, of course, there are other factors.  (Like assuming that the words
homosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive.  I seem to remember that a
lot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ...""
specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.)  But if you think about
it, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say a
word that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"".

and women that I know) gays have a general idea of how straights think
because they are raised as straights.  Unfortunately, we aren't blessed
with a society whose parents might consider that their children might
not be heterosexual.  From my experience, children on this planet tend
to be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of their
own.  Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, it
makes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straights
think.
	As for straights thinking of men only when considering
homosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right.  Ask
any ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like.  The
odds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someone
who wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be a
transvestite.  Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pride
celebrations, few women are seen.  Perhaps if lesbians were more
visible to the outside world, they might become part of the stereotype
(if, indeed, this is desirable).

	One of the points which Dan Greening mentions in his article
""What about politics, . . ."" regards the focus of ""gay money"" in AIDS
projects.  He seems concerned that most of the gay-sponsored AIDS
projects spend *lots* of money on patient support, and that not much of
the money from gay sources is spent on research.  He seems to feel
that some of the money should be re-directed from the support functions
to the research functions.
	Although I understand his concern that we should spend more on
research and whup this monster for good, we *shouldn't* decrease
funding for the AIDS projects which support victims, their SO's and
families.   It's important to keep in mind that (in many cases) the
victim is left jobless (either because he can no longer perform
required tasks due to his illness or because he was fired for being gay
and having AIDS) and homeless.  We have to help support our own. These
support groups aren't just rap groups and counseling sessions; they are
providing *vital* services to AIDS victims.
	I'd like to hear more about this.  It's important stuff.

out there seem to be asking homosexuals to justify the fact that they are
not bad, I'd like to turn the question back to you.  What makes you think
that you can put yourself in a position of righteousness and demand of
others that they justify their preferences without you ever justifying yours.
You make an analogy between pedophilia and homosexuality.  I will answer your
question on why I think pedophilia is bad.  First of all, pedophilia is the
wrong word. pedophilia means loving children.  I don't see what could be
wrong with that if the children are willing throughout but it is very hard 
to know if they are willing or not.  When one thinks of pedophilia one is
usually thinking of rape as ""incest"" also seems to have taken on the meaning
of rape by a member of one's immediate family when actually all it means is
sexual relationship between members of the same family.  Anyway when children
are involved it is very hard to determine the degree of willingness of the
child as the adult is more powerful than the child most often (no matter what
certain authors would like people to believe).  That is why I think pedophilia
incestuous or not, is dangerous:  it leaves the door open to a lot of abuse
as the two participants are not of equal strength. (Actually an analogy between
pedophilia and heterosexuality would make much more sense, as partners in
heterosexual relationships are often of unequal strength, which leaves the
door open to a lot of abuse - and many people do go through that door)
Homosexuality is different (even though some people like to lump them 
together for shock effect).  The homosexuality being discussed here is
between consenting adults.  It is a cliche, but is the main point of it.
Why is it ""wrong"" for two consenting adults of the same sex to have 
sexual relationships?  why not?  since you are claiming that it isn't,
the onus is on you to prove that it isn't.  The position of homosexuals
on the net have been so far, that it is not right or wrong either way,
i.e they are not putting a moral judgement on the act.  So why are you?
explain yourself, tell us what you base your moral judgement on in the
first place, so that we don't get into pointless discussions.  If it is
on a certain book, then how do you know this book is right?  
(this is all net.religion stuff it seems. so what is it doing in net.motss?
yeah it seems that once again net.motss is turning into a place where
homosexuals have to defend their preferences)

But, you see, psychology will NEVER be science, and ""mental illness"" isn't
quantifiable the way the wavelength of light is.  It is not a ""thing"", it
is simply a classification of behavior, here the most broad category that
one could imagine, one that separates behavior into ""good"" and ""bad"".  
The APA wasn't operating in a vacuum when it voted to strike homosexuality
from this classification.  It was forming an opinion based on the emerging
mainstream view of sexual orientation and what constitutes mental illness.  
It is valid to ask the question: ""If an individual is well-adjusted,
emotionally mature, behaves properly, is well-integrated into his/her
environment, and this person happens to be gay, is it USEFUL to describe
that person as ""mentally ill?""  You can see how the APA answered this
question.

though there are many points which deserve a response.  But it seems to me
that this one is the crux of the matter, and the stumbling block for many
people who label themselves Christian.  I am taking up this response,
not because I feel the need to justify myself before anyone, but because
I really am trying to understand what is at the basis of what I view as
extremely irrational, unfounded behavior.
	>The way I see it homosexual practice is largely a moral issue.
I really do not understand this.  Really not.  In fact it sounds just a bit
bizarre to me.  Sort of like ""eating oysters is largely a moral issue.""
Human relations (of any sort) are grounded in the moral arena, but what is
so special about homosexual acts in and of themselves which entitles them
to being singled out for moral notice?  It seems to me that there is only
one reason for this attitude, namely, the misinterpretation of the Genesis
and Levitical texts and some of the Pauline letters adopted over the last
700 years by the Christian Church.  At least one knows where such people
are coming from: it's just a variant of ""the Bible says so, so it's true.""
Now, such people don't cotton well to being told about the subtleties of
the texts, and the contexts in which they appear, nor do they bother to
carry forth other Scriptural proscriptions against certain behaviors. I
always liked the one about it being easier for a camel to pass through an
eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  Oh--you
mean that wasn't REALLY what was being said.  You mean I need to understand
the CONTEXT of Christ's teachings.  Uh-huh.
Anyway, I want to know whether those Christians who feel, as Paul Dubuc does,
that homosexuality is a ""moral"" issue, feel that the moral argument lies
entirely upon what you perceive Scripture to be saying.  That is, because
you read the Bible as condemning such actions, homosexuality there, and
there alone, takes upon itself a moral dimension.  In that case, how do
you deal with a pluralistic, secular society which is not Bible-based?
What right do you have to enforce your conceptions of morality upon those
members of society who do not share your reading of Scripture?
And if you feel that there is more to morality and homosexuality than
simply the meagre, disputable allusions in the Bible, then by all means
state it!  I have never once heard an argument ""against"" homosexuality
that did not collapse under scrutiny, and which was not ultimately
founded upon misinformation about gay people or questionable assumptions.
As many of the readers will undoubtedly point out, this discussion is
not really necessary, since gay people will continue to exist quite happily
whether or not they receive the approbation of the Fundamentalist
religionists.  I am doing this more as a favor to them, so that they
can get their opinions stated clearly once and for all here.  It should
go without saying that this is not an invitation to inappropriate behavior
in this newsgroup, and also, the other readers should feel free to speak up
if they think that this discussion isn't worth pursuing here.  It's obviously
interesting enough to me here, right now.

What Gary was (and is) saying is that such meetings deserve some special
treatment.  After all, this would apply to ANY religious gathering, but
Christianity, that's different, eh?  Again, your goal was to claim that
this was ""discrimination"", the fact that Christians were treated just like

Ah, but science leads to conclusions like evolution, and the skepticism

I meant to type ""anti-humanist"", and what's more I think you're fully

it, such people, when they proclaim that that word of god (as they see it)

That was light.  A light that needs to be cast on the real reasons behind

Better referred to as ""wishful thinking"", to be sure.  When you base your
judgments of the way you perceive the world to be on ""what you hope for"",
you are deliberating failing to be objective, and clouding your conclusions.
Which is OK (or not) depending on your goals.  If you're not looking for

As seen in Samuelson's summart of his own original article, the only ""fair""
hearing in his view would be one that holds Christianity up as the absolute
truth.  After all, any other ""hearing"" would show flaws in it, and he certainly
doesn't want THAT.

And with good reason:  they have taught them a biased and bogus set of
beliefs contrary to real reality.  Not just *different* from ""norms"" (as
with customs of ethnic groups), contrary to reality.  Indeed, I ""revel"" (maybe
too strong a word, perhaps ""be pleased to see"") in religion dying out
from disuse.  I have repeatedly said that it is not my wish to forcefully
eradicate religion.  To do so would make us no better than they are.
To let it drop dead of its own weight as more and more people are
informed, would certainly prove better.  Of course, it is possible
that dispensing of such information through education may be seen as
an attempt at eradication by some.

""The state""?  Parents should and do have a say in what their children
are taught.  It's a shame that parents who want to teach their children
a set of beliefs regardless of their relationship to reality exercise this
right all too much, producing non-thinking children (and later adults)
as a result.

It's even less surprising that a philosophy that assumes the existence of
god in a particular form leads to conclusions about the existence of god
that match those assumptions.  But of course, Gary is not assuming, he
knows the truth about the existence of god.  I will let him do so in the

I said that the methods of education described above would ""effectively
wipe out religion"".  As I've said many times before, eradicating religion
by force is not a goal nor a desire of mine, though Samuelson would like
you to think because it aids him in his perpetually manipulative style
of rhetoric and argument.

Yes, Gary, we're all heinous fascists for wanting to encourage teaching of
""thinking before believing"" ideas.  Once we've ""forcibly"" stoppoed people
from wishful thinking about gods, we'll turn our evil hands towards other
wishful thinking beliefs like ...   Only a true scholar of fascistic
manipulation would go out of his way to twist words to imply that those
who support teaching rational thinking in schools are out to forcibly
crush other ideas like the purveyors of Nazi genocide.  If your ideas
are sound, Gary, after some rigorous examination, they will hold up.  If not,
they won't.  That's the ""force"" with which ""I"" (??) will ""wipe out""
fallacious thinking.  The stronger force of all.

I think this merits a translation from the opinions of a fanatical Christian
into words approaching a more objective version of what secular humanism is
and what people like Boskovich say about it that it is not.
If it teaches them to think about suicide, about why people might feel
like committing suicide in this world (rather than covering up or ignoring
the fact), great!  If it teaches them to make their own choices about sex
based on positive real information and not edicts, great!  If it teaches
them that some people's lives are worth less than others, it's probably
a religious institution we're talking about and not a school teaching
the dreaded secular humanism (note how such religious schooling did and
still does teach about the inferiority of, not only non-Christian groups,
but even other Christian groups in many cases).  If it teaches them to
think for themselves and not blindly accept the values of their parents
and clergy, given them the faculties and tools to do so, GREAT!!!!!!!!
I can only hope for more of this in the future.

Thank God for that!  :-)  This is the raving of a paranoid desperately

people's thoughts because they are taught a little bit of reasoning
ability to help them reach new conclusions, what are you going to do
about it?  Call teaching of such things ""secular humanism"" and try to
ban it?  That's exactly what you are doing with your vile disgusting lies
designed to smear the teaching to children of how to think for themselves
independent of you and your precious so-called values.

Especially you, Mr. Boskovich.  It is most apparent that you are making
up stories about what ""the teaching of secular humanism in our schools""
is all about, to further your own sick ends.  Hopefully some day your
children may be able to write a set of essays about objective proof for
something (as you did) in which they actually provide objective proof,
having learned what it means and how to acquire it.  Why do you want to
stop this from happening?  Because you value your values more than the
good of your own children?

Anybody who would trust the word of Phyllis Schafly, a woman whose writing

Dan, if you are such a ""good Christian"", why do feel the need to make up
lies about the ""evil secular humanism"" in order to preserve your values
at the expense of teaching your children about reasoning, science, and
independent thought?  Are you a Communist?  It sounds like a Communist plot
to squelch the minds of our children and make them willing slaves when
the Commies take over?  I don't believe this, of course, but reassure me
please:  are the fundamentalist Christians really Communists out to destroy
the foundation of American thinking?

I don't wish to get into the issue of premarital sex except to mention
that there it is not currently a method for some people to engage in
marriage under this American legal system, same sex couples for example.
HOWEVER, homosexuality is not a choice to consider, because it is a given.
That is to say that there are homosexuals, and those of us who are such
did not necessarily ""choose"" to be so.  It is true that some of us chose to
happily engage in homosexual activities rather than remaining in unhappy
little closets called acting hetro or remaining celibate.  And all schools
should teach that for homosexual children, there definately is that option.

Them's strong words, Dan, and I expect you to document them or say that you
are wrong.  By document I mean show me where in a ""secular humanist""
document that is identifiable as such the above are proffered.  I do not
mean in a book *about* ""secular humanism"" by some yo-ho like Phyllis
Shafley or Jimmy Swaggart.  I mean in a manifesto *by* so-called ""secular

 [ and several more paragraphs that reinforce the same idea ]
Ellen, I agree with your comments that the image presented in Playboy
is ridiculously unrealistic, and I think I can see your real concern
that men will believe it.  But not all men do, any more than they believe
what they see on television or in films.
An important question is: given that Playboy's sort of pornography is
misleading, what should be done to correct the problem?  Should we ban it,
or should we try to educate people?  And if banning it is the correct
solution, should we not also immediately ban most TV commercials on the
same grounds?  Or maybe most TV programs too.
Should I not ask that all John Wayne movies be permanently
banned, on the grounds that they present an unrealistic and even dangerous
image of what a man should be like?  Aren't Clint Eastwood movies even better
candidates for banning?
I agree that there is a problem.  I don't think that censorship is the
answer in this case.  Do you?  If so, how is this case different from
the other examples I mention?","fwIgOdBNqDoJ",19,1985-09-07,-19,1

It is a shame, but the ""public"" can be very easily manipulated
to believe almost anything.  The ""media"" (another strange entity)
seems to have made up its mind recently to prematurely bury
feminism by defamation and assertions that it has passed away.
Anyone who really wants to learn something about a certain
school of thought should really not rely on reader's digest
condensations of it but should instead go directly to the sources,
i.e in this case, feminist writings.  Having read a lot of feminist
material myself, I have found basically that there is not one
single issue on which all feminists agree (or did I miss it?).
I have seen all sorts of very good feminist analyses exploring all
kinds of important issues reaching very different conclusions.  This
does not mean that feminism is a philosophy that cannot make up its
mind, but simply that it is a philosophy that acknowledges the
complexity of life.
Anyway the reason for this preamble was to point out that there is not
ONE feminist position on censorship of pornography.  Of all the
issues I have seen discussed in feminist forums, censorship is probably
*the* issue where there is the most disagreement, and rightly so,
because it is such a thorny one.  Therefore, even though Andrea Dworkin
would really like to do so, she does *not* speak for all feminists.

While I cannot agree with some frothing at the mouth that I have
seen coming from some anti-pornographers (?), I think that it is
too easy to dismiss the idea of censorship of pornography as you
did by calling it a ""right-wing, moral majority type of thing"".
A responsible society should be able to censor itself when not
doing so endangers the life of some of its members.  Pornography
does pause a real threat to women, and the solution to this threat
might just include some amount of censorship.

And I think the above is a cheap shot.  Who are you to decide
exactly what is in Ellen's mind?  It is one thing to object
to things one might consider disgusting even though it poses
no threat to oneself (such as homosexuality). It is another
to object to things that one considers pauses a personal threat.
I object to pornography for this reason.  It scares the hell out
of me to know that some person might read some of that crap and
decide to act out his fantasies on me against my will.  That
has NOTHING to do with what other people do in the privacy of their
own bedroom, it has to do with MY safety.

Oh give us a break!  we all know that.  Nobody's objecting to
people's sexual preferences here, they're objecting to hate
litterature which endangers their safety.

And I believe that your article is pretty much a rationalisation
to support the fact that you have a lifetime suscription to
Playboy, Penthouse and all sorts of other magazines showing little
children and women being cut up into little pieces while enjoying 
it all, and YOU enjoy it all and you don't want anybody to spoil
your fun.  So there!
See, anybody can psychoanalyse anybody else if they want to and
dismiss their arguments without listening to them.  You are not
immune to it.  So if you don't want to be subject to this kind of
abuse why don't you practice what you preach and be a little
more tolerant of those you dismiss as intoleranty simply because
you don't want to bother listening to what they are saying.

Gee, and I thought the right to physical safety was one of our

Of course you are not alone in your opinion.  It certainly is
not an original one as I've pointed out above.  Ah, yes, how much
you care about the ""movement""..  reminds me of Ken Arndt and how
much he ""cares"" about homosexuals.  With friends like that.....

Two reasons why I am against ALL censorship:
1. In the 1950s, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita was not allowed into
   the U.S.A. for some time because it was considered ""pornographic.""
   Many people believe today that Lolita is one of the masterpieces of
   post-WW2 literature (myself included). James Joyce's Ulysses, also
   an influential and many say important piece of art, was similarly 
   banned (there was a famous court trial over Ulysses, as I recall).
2. I grew up in the Corn Belt, and our next-door neighbor was a farm
   woman from Minnesota. One day she called my mother and complained
   that the local high school had her son reading pornography. My
   mother asked her what she meant, and the neighbor said he had been
   assigned a book to read that dealt with extramarital sex and
   illegitimacy as its major themes. She wanted my mother to join her
   in a 'crusade' to rid the high school of such filth and thereby
   preserve the minds of our youth. The book was, of course, Hawthorne's
   The Scarlet Letter.
Who is to say what is pornography and what is not? Like it or not, we
live in a pluralistic society. I will NOT tolerate anyone: fundamentalist 
Christian, black activist, feminist, Republican, Democrat, telling me 
what I can or cannot read. First, the obvious targets go: hard porn
that most would agree has no redeeming social value. Then, someone
will claim that books like Ulysses and Lolita are pornography, since
""filth"" like this obviously can't be art. Unless you live under a rock
you surely realize that there's a hell of a lot of people out there
who won't want to stop once the adult book stores are closed down.
I find the agenda of radical feminists like Dworkin as threatening to
my freedom as the agenda of certain radical fundamentalists of the
right. Stay OUT of my bedroom and keep your hands OFF my bookshelf!

The point I was making (clearly I thought) was that there is not ONE
feminist position on censorship of pornography.  What I've noticed
from reading feminist litterature is that this issue is creating a
split in the feminist community.  The next point I was making is that
""the media"" has been ignoring the voices of anti-censorship feminists.
(I did say both of these things.  I don't know how much clearer I can
make my point).  Therefore, all I was trying to say is that you shouldn't
rely on the popular media to get a deep understanding on feminist ideas,
just like you shouldn't rely on the popular media to get an understanding
of what hackers are.  If you believe that media, all of us hackers are
criminals and feminists are all pro-censorship.

Yes, and it doesn't and that is very unfortunate because we do not have
a responsible society.  Whether the *state* should enforce censorship is
another issue.  The point I was trying to make (awkwardly - my fault)
is that some rights have to be weighed out against others, and I do not
find it inconceivable that in a ""perfect"" society, pornography would not
exist because people would realise that its benefits are not worth the pain
that it creates.  How we achieve such a society, I don't know.

It wasn't the point of my posting either.  The reason I posted was that I
was incensed by the atmosphere of insensitivity that surrounds this whole
issue.  I do not believe in censorship either, but I cannot respect people
who will refuse to acknowledge the negative feelings that some pronography
causes some people.  All pornography is not equal, some of it is harmless
and even stupid, some of it is fun, but there is also some of it which is
very depressing.  All I would like is for anti-censorship people to say:
""yes we realise that pornography hurts, but we really don't think that
censorship is going to solve the problem"" instead of ""if pornography hurts
you, it's because you are sexually repressed and you simply want to impose
your prudishness on other people"".  All I would like is some more compassion,
and I don't see much of it (except from Sherry, who of course was attacked
for it).

I don't care about whether pornography is a valid form of entertainment
or not.  (Actually, I have bought some pornography (gay) and got some good
giggles out of it, so I guess it was entertaining).  But yes, I do feel
threatened by some pornography, and some of it makes me very depressed.
I don't know about ""people like me"" and their attitudes, but I don't see

Well some people see it as ""hate litterature"" and that's why they want it
banned, not because they don't agree with the form of sexual expression.
You see, you are doing it again: you are refusing to listen to other people's
opinions on pornography.  Some pornography is obviously hateful of women.  Why
are you refusing to admit this?  Admitting this does not entail that you have
to be pro-censorship.

Yeah, but do they explain why?  Is this ""respect"" based on actual caring for
the welfare of society and its members or is it just one of those wonderful
slogans that makes one feel proud to be free to be proud to live in the
greatest (and freeest and proudest) country in the world?

I think this is a very good point.  I just wish you hadn't surrounded it
with all the other garbage and personnal attacks against pro-censorship
feminists.  Yes, I worry about this too, but as I explained a few times
I see this more as an outside misrepresentation of feminism than anything
else because I really don't see feminist being united in this issue at all.
One would hope that people who care about these issues would care enough
to distrust the media's portrayal of (anything in general, but more
particularly) the feminist community's opinion on the matter.  That is
probably very wishful thinking however.

I hope not, I'd have to write myself off.  Until very recently, I was very
annoyed by this issue and refused to have a position on it because a/ I believe
that there were more important feminist topics to worry about and b/ I didn't
like any of the arguments I had heard from either the feminist pro-censorship
side or the liberal anti-censorship side (and of course not the right-wing-
protect-our-women's-purity side either).  However, I have recently been exposed
to some feminist anti-censorship positions which do not attempt to excuse
pornography, and do not dismiss the problem and pain as imaginary, but who
simply and reasonnably adress the issue of whether censorship is an appropriate
reaction to this problem (and come out concluding that it isn't).  I am 
convinced.
>but because I'm male, and tried to dig a little deeper
>into the background of the pro-censorship movement,
>she writes me off instantly.  Wonderful.
I don't think you dug deep enough.  All you did was slander, and that's what
I objected to.  My opinion is that a pro-censorship attitude is a very
understandable reaction to the feeling of threat that pornography causes,
but that one must move beyond that position and realise that censorship would
create more problems than it would solve, because it would almost certainly
be used against the exact people it was supposedly meant to protect.
Actually some men have already said this on the net.  I didn't object.

Well, then you seem to *freely* believe what the media has told you. 
Feminists are divided on this issue: even though Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon are pro-censorship, Robin Morgan, Erica Jong, and
Carol Vance (the ones I can remember for sure) are against it.  An organisation
called FACT ( Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force ) fought the Minneapolis
ordinance.  Many feminists (or at least those who express themselves by
writing) have had the opportunity to see the effect of censorship laws
on themselves and are thus very aware of the dangers of such laws.  For
a good collection of articles on the matter, I recommend the book ""Women
against Censorship"" edited by Varda Burstein.  You might be interested in
the april 1985 issue of Ms ""Is one woman's sexuality another woman's
pornography"" and the September 1978 issue of Ms: ""How to run the
pornographers out of town and preserve the first amendment"" by Robin Morgan.

Seems to me this argument can cut both ways.  My SO could just as well lose

Judging from this description, Waterloo sounds, er, ""unusual"".
Bus pushing contests don't sounds like the sort of thing a ""typical""
engineer would be interested in.  Most engineers' talents lie in the
brain, not in the biceps.
The ""Lady Godiva Day"" sounds like standard college foolishness.
If you don't want to be around college foolishness, don't go
to college.
The ""humour"" paper sounds like the sort of garbage lower life forms
tend to enjoy.  I'm not sure what Canada's position is on ""freedom
of the press"", but this sort of paper would be rather hard to
outlaw in the US without lots of people yelling about the first
admendment.  We may not like it, but we seem to be stuck with it,
least we give the book-burners a free reign.  :-(
The ""cobra"" game sounds like something which needs to be stomped
on, hard.  This sort of thing is inexcusable.
Yes, it sounds like the Waterloo engineering dept is full of low-life,
sexist slimeballs.  Don't assume that this applies to engineers in
general.
Purdue (a *real* engineering school) has events like calculator
olympics and go-kart races (""where'd that physics book go?"")

Absolutely true.  Let me give an example from my real-world experience:
Back in the early '70s I was working for the Los Angeles  County  Engineer,
Aviation  Division.  At  that  time, _all_ airport attendants were male, by
Division policy.  Then the  Board  of  Supervisors  handed  down  an  edict
prohibiting sexual discrimination in hiring practices ...
You wouldn't have believed the  confusion.  Two  division  chiefs  and  six
airport  managers  were  running around for weeks trying to figure a way to
legally _not_ comply with the edict.  They asked _everyone_,  including  me
and some of the (female) secretaries(!), to dream up excuses for them.
Typical excuse:  ""There aren't any women's showers at the airports.""
Pretty lame, right?  Well, they used it.
Note that we're not talking  about  a  highly  skilled  position  here.  An
airport  attendant  was  a  not-very-glorified gas pump jockey.  In between
fueling planes, they'd weed the median  strips  and  perform  miscellaneous
janitorial  tasks.  Not what you'd call Doctorate level stuff.  Nor did the
job call for great physical strength.
If this goes on in the Civil  Service,  imagine  what  happens  in  private
business.

they worked to shape their environments into their image of

Today's young, professional straight couples actually have a lot in common

There's not much difference there, except sexual preference!  Some

Now that you ask, I can't figure out what he's saying either.  But when

6th.  It's addressed to all voters who think they may vote for Reagan,
but especially to closet Republicans, [Ll]ibertarians, and gay people.
(The views expressed herein are my own, & not those of my employer.)
To my mind the foremost reason for not reinstating Ronnie is his
inveterate homophobia.  I wish to dissuade voters who entertain
any of the following notions:
1) Reagan is personally a Nice Guy, free of prejudice himself, but
   politically allied with conspicuous homophobes, whom he ignores
   or tries to contain;
2) Reagan's a bigot, but also a staunch defender of privacy and
   unhampered free enterprise; this, say Libertarians, makes
   civil rights laws redundant & unnecessary (& obnoxious);
3) Reagan is a nasty idiot, who can't tell an ""individual right""
   from a hole-in-the-wall, but the direction or EFFECT of his
   administration is beneficial.  No matter how dreadful specific
   Reagan policies, programs, or appointees are, a net good must
   result.
In defense of 1)-3), one could cite two actions:
-- In 1978, in his newspaper column, Reagan was the first major
   California politician to publically oppose the Briggs Initia-
   tive (which would have allowed local school boards to dismiss
   teachers ""advocating sexual lifestyle"", a phrase which was left
   undefined).  Reagan was out of office then, with no constituents
   to answer to; opposition to the Initiative didn't necessarily
   imply tolerance, but rather a desire not to undercut teachers' 
   authority & most educational and teachers' organizations had 
   already come out publically against the initiative (with an
   eye to his political future, Reagan may've wished to conciliate(?)
   California educators, whom he'd utterly alienated as governor
   by making godawful John Bircher Max Rafferty education czar).
-- It is said (this isn't more than a rather pious rumor) that Reagan
   helped to kill Roger Jepsen's bizarre Family Protection Act by in-
   action, etc.
(A third matter, Terry Dolan's giving THE ADVOCATE, a gay biweekly, 
an interview 2 years ago, for which he caught a lot of flak from 
other Reagan supporters, is in the realm of PR, a pretty shaky 
basis for a belief in Reagan's tolerance).
The truth is that appeal to antihomosexual bigotry has been a staple
of Reagan's political career from its very outset.  In 1967 he cam-
paigned for governor of California largely by obsessively charging
that the University of California at Berkeley was a ""hotbed of homo-
sexuality & communism"".  This ""queer smear"" derived entirely from a
nonviolent & rather minor campus controversy:  the editor-in-chief of
the undergraduate paper, The Daily Califorian, had published a series
of articles on homosexuals in the Bay Area.  The series was done in
an objective, social-scientific vein (the editor was a sociology major).
University regents, as timid as ever, ousted him from the editorship,
but the student senate (I think) reinstated him.  Big deal.  Apparently
Reagan thought it was, especially for his political ambitions: he won 
the election.
In 1967 no New Right existed, and the far right had virtually no power
or influence, even locally.  Reagan could not have then been the poli-
tical captive of militantly homophobic supporters.  Altho' fagbaiting
is a venerable tradition in American politics, usually employed in the
desperate final days of a losing campaign to slander opponents by innu-
endo, few politicians have made the blatant, indiscriminate, repeated,
& lengthy use of it that Ronald Reagan has.

What gives any belief system (or any group of adherents to a belief
system) the right to ""denormalize""/outlaw/prohibit any set of behaviors
that doesn't interfere with or harm other human beings?  If anybody
has that ""right"" now, it's a right worth taking away.

If the prison system had the means to truly psychologically rehabilitate
rapists/murderers/ALL those who feel they have some sort of right to
interfere in other people's lives, then ""protection"" for such
rehabilitated people would be warranted, NOT to allow them to re-engage
in their anti-human activities, but rather to live their lives in peace.
What anti-human activities are homosexuals guilty of?  (By the way, I
thought ""gay"" was used not to make things more ""palatable"" for those
like you---it hasn't and it won't---but rather as a self-descriptive term
to provide a positive self-image for gay people, as opposed to the malicious
and/or more clinical terms.)

Let's also be sure to make sure that anything else that we ""just don't

I assume the author is referring to his own vindictive arbitrary hatred.
Disgust is in the eye of the beholder.  What give such beholders the right
to impose behavior standards on beholdees?  And, if nature is ""what happens
in the real world"", how can anything that actually happens be a perversion
of nature?  Or are only one person's specific views on what is ""natural"" the
basis for guidelines?

	First, I would much rather do my own thinking than have
God do my thinking for me.
	Second, if people have the freedom to do what they want,
why are you so concerned about what they do?  As long as they are
not trying to force their views upon you, they should be free to
do as they wish.  As a gay male, and as a person of color, I
don't believe that because I am gay (or Black), I have a 'right'
to certain things.  However, I do believe that as an American, I
have a 'right' to freedom of association, job opportunity, etc.
	Finally, I invite you to elaborate on the 'societal
impact' of not viewing homosexuality as a sin.
	Oh yeah, almost forgot.  I plan to vote for Reagan.

        I have to disagree with your last  statement.  There
are instances where homosexual activity has been observed in
the  animal  kingdom.   There  were  some  articles  in  net
religion  about  it  last year.  I am trying to look them up
for you.  My real point, however, is that it does happen  in
animals  as  well  as people.  If that be the case, then you
cannot call it a ""perversion of nature.""

I really not trying to make an example out of Mike Leibensperger,
as there are others who have argued the same point.  A few years
ago I would have done the same!  Here is an excerpt from Mike:

I've looked at Penthouse; heck, I've *bought* Penthouse in the past.
They have good interviews, and occasionally good articles and fiction.
And lots of pictures of very nice-looking women in various uncomfortable-
looking poses, with genitals or breasts exposed.  And I once looked at these
pictures quite a bit.  Eventually they became familiar, and lost their
erotic effect.  And as the fog of desire lifted, I began to see the
person in the pictures.  (Sounds a bit corny, I know, but I think it
describes pretty much how I felt.)  The women's faces and postures began
to look fearful or submissive.  Their eyes were usually adverted, except
when their posture showed exaggerated submission.  Or the pictures seemed
purely voyeurisic, with the woman unaware of the camera.  And it began
to dawn on me that the feminist accusations against men's magazines
were *true*.  These women were presented as objects to be used, and
not as lovers/friends/people.  There is a difference between sexual
desire and wanting someone as an object for sexual use.
(I might mention that voyeurism--watching a person in a vulnerable
state without being vulnerable yourself--is a power-trip.  In a way,
it is *forcing* a person to submit to your desire to look, as they have
no control over it.  Thus, I might find *more* redeeming features in
more hard-core materials than Penthouse if there were less a sense of
intrusion and the portrayal wasn't weighted down with stereotypes or
dominance.)
If you still aren't convinced that Penthouse puts down women, just read
some of the sex fantasies in their `Forum' section.  Study the vocabulary
a bit.  Sexual intercourse is an act of force, even of pain, in a lot of
these.  And some of them are a lot more blatant; I remember one in which
a man tells of turning his wife into a sex-slave--the acts described
(which I won't go into here) were so criminal as to be worthy of a life
sentence in many states.  Yet there was no note of this fact; just a
glowing report of how nice this man's life has become with his new
`pet'.
Needless to say, I no longer buy Penthouse (or any other magazine of
its ilk).  Censorship?  I'm a civil libertarian; besides, I consider
these magazines to be a symptom, not a cause.  But I obviously won't
heasitate to tell people what I think these magazines really are.

I am curious, do you people believe that these letters are for real?  I have
read some of those ""forum"" letters myself and they were the most ridiculous
stories I could ever imagine.  It sounded like they came from some overexcited
adolescent minds.  I could not imagine people doing those things seriously,

I'll agree that the beach pictures were usually pretty harmless, but
I don't remember many of them.  And even indoor shots had exceptions,
some of which were tasteful and even erotic without voyeurism or
debasement.  But just because something is absent on some occasions
doesn't mean it isn't there at all.
And, yes, I read some of my feelings into the images, but no more than
in looking at, say, a LIFE magazine photo.  That was the point of my
original article--as soon as I began looking at the pictures for what
they were (photographs of obviously posed individuals, with careful
attention to staging and costume), rather than whatever they pretended
to be, the *intellectual* connection was made.  Try it yourself; ask
yourself just what statement is being made about the individual in the
photograph.  Sometimes--maybe not even half the time, but certainly
often--you'll see the message I described.
Advocating slavery or abuse of either sex is hardly right, and doing
so under the guise of sexual liberation only makes it more wrong.  Of
course, the fact that the `letters' are fictional doesn't detract from
this--in fact, it changes their status from the presentation of reader
opinion into a form of advocacy.
But I'll repeat that I strongly oppose censorship, or the banning of
pornography.  And I'm no prude, either (references available upon
request :-)  ).

you seek to cover that up.

What Gary was (and is) saying is that such meetings deserve some special
treatment.  After all, this would apply to ANY religious gathering, but
Christianity, that's different, eh?  Again, your goal was to claim that
this was ""discrimination"", the fact that Christians were treated just like
any other religion.

Your article then (and now) refers to ""CHRISTIANS (not religious believers,
just Christians) not being allowed the freedom of worship"".  Let's get
serious.

Ah, but science leads to conclusions like evolution, and the skepticism
that leads to agnosticism or atheism (after enough examination).  These
are among the things that these people are seeking to have removed from

They are part of what the religionists seek to abolish.  After all, how

Well, I don't believe that the Christians would take this advice.  Even they
know the value of math and science, even when they disagree with the
conclusions.  It wasn't a serious prediction for that reason.  (See below.)

I meant to type ""anti-humanist"", and what's more I think you're fully
aware of that, since it's a pretty simple typo.  But, come to think of
it, such people, when they proclaim that that word of god (as they see it)
is over and above human needs, they are being anti-human.

That was light.  A light that needs to be cast on the real reasons behind
so-called Christian efforts to ""ban"" secular humanism.

Indeed.  And Samuelson thinks faith must be right.  It is not a faith
in objectivity that moves me.  It is evidence that it is more accurate
than whimsical faith.

Exactly.  And Samuelson chooses faith, not because it is demonstrably
better (quite the opposite) but because he likes the conclusions better.
We know what term I used to refer to that.

I would think it belonged to neither.  Does Samuelson think the world
belongs to religionists?

Better referred to as ""wishful thinking"", to be sure.  When you base your
judgments of the way you perceive the world to be on ""what you hope for"",
you are deliberating failing to be objective, and clouding your conclusions.
Which is OK (or not) depending on your goals.  If you're not looking for
truth or reality, it's fine.

As seen in Samuelson's summart of his own original article, the only ""fair""
hearing in his view would be one that holds Christianity up as the absolute
truth.  After all, any other ""hearing"" would show flaws in it, and he certainly
doesn't want THAT.

I said maybe.  The above was a speculation.  Yes, I defined religionist
as did the dictionary, and you have continued to fit the definition.

And with good reason:  they have taught them a biased and bogus set of
beliefs contrary to real reality.  Not just *different* from ""norms"" (as
with customs of ethnic groups), contrary to reality.  Indeed, I ""revel"" (maybe
too strong a word, perhaps ""be pleased to see"") in religion dying out
from disuse.  I have repeatedly said that it is not my wish to forcefully
eradicate religion.  To do so would make us no better than they are.
To let it drop dead of its own weight as more and more people are
informed, would certainly prove better.  Of course, it is possible
that dispensing of such information through education may be seen as
an attempt at eradication by some.

""The state""?  Parents should and do have a say in what their children
are taught.  It's a shame that parents who want to teach their children
a set of beliefs regardless of their relationship to reality exercise this
right all too much, producing non-thinking children (and later adults)
as a result.

It's even less surprising that a philosophy that assumes the existence of
god in a particular form leads to conclusions about the existence of god
that match those assumptions.  But of course, Gary is not assuming, he
knows the truth about the existence of god.  I will let him do so in the
reply article that is sure not to follow because he will never respond
to a Rich Rosen article again.
>>...would effectively wipe out

I said that the methods of education described above would ""effectively
wipe out religion"".  As I've said many times before, eradicating religion
by force is not a goal nor a desire of mine, though Samuelson would like
you to think because it aids him in his perpetually manipulative style
of rhetoric and argument.

Yes, Gary, we're all heinous fascists for wanting to encourage teaching of
""thinking before believing"" ideas.  Once we've ""forcibly"" stoppoed people
from wishful thinking about gods, we'll turn our evil hands towards other
wishful thinking beliefs like ...   Only a true scholar of fascistic
manipulation would go out of his way to twist words to imply that those
who support teaching rational thinking in schools are out to forcibly
crush other ideas like the purveyors of Nazi genocide.  If your ideas
are sound, Gary, after some rigorous examination, they will hold up.  If not,
they won't.  That's the ""force"" with which ""I"" (??) will ""wipe out""
fallacious thinking.  The stronger force of all.

I think this merits a translation from the opinions of a fanatical Christian
into words approaching a more objective version of what secular humanism is
and what people like Boskovich say about it that it is not.
If it teaches them to think about suicide, about why people might feel
like committing suicide in this world (rather than covering up or ignoring
the fact), great!  If it teaches them to make their own choices about sex
based on positive real information and not edicts, great!  If it teaches
them that some people's lives are worth less than others, it's probably
a religious institution we're talking about and not a school teaching
the dreaded secular humanism (note how such religious schooling did and
still does teach about the inferiority of, not only non-Christian groups,
but even other Christian groups in many cases).  If it teaches them to
think for themselves and not blindly accept the values of their parents
and clergy, given them the faculties and tools to do so, GREAT!!!!!!!!
I can only hope for more of this in the future.

Thank God for that!  :-)  This is the raving of a paranoid desperately

people's thoughts because they are taught a little bit of reasoning
ability to help them reach new conclusions, what are you going to do
about it?  Call teaching of such things ""secular humanism"" and try to

Especially you, Mr. Boskovich.  It is most apparent that you are making
up stories about what ""the teaching of secular humanism in our schools""
is all about, to further your own sick ends.  Hopefully some day your
children may be able to write a set of essays about objective proof for
something (as you did) in which they actually provide objective proof,
having learned what it means and how to acquire it.  Why do you want to
stop this from happening?  Because you value your values more than the
good of your own children?

Anybody who would trust the word of Phyllis Schafly, a woman whose writing

Dan, if you are such a ""good Christian"", why do feel the need to make up
lies about the ""evil secular humanism"" in order to preserve your values
at the expense of teaching your children about reasoning, science, and
independent thought?  Are you a Communist?  It sounds like a Communist plot
to squelch the minds of our children and make them willing slaves when
the Commies take over?  I don't believe this, of course, but reassure me
please:  are the fundamentalist Christians really Communists out to destroy
the foundation of American thinking?

I don't wish to get into the issue of premarital sex except to mention
that there it is not currently a method for some people to engage in
marriage under this American legal system, same sex couples for example.
HOWEVER, homosexuality is not a choice to consider, because it is a given.
That is to say that there are homosexuals, and those of us who are such
did not necessarily ""choose"" to be so.  It is true that some of us chose to
happily engage in homosexual activities rather than remaining in unhappy
little closets called acting hetro or remaining celibate.  And all schools
should teach that for homosexual children, there definately is that option.

Them's strong words, Dan, and I expect you to document them or say that you
are wrong.  By document I mean show me where in a ""secular humanist""
document that is identifiable as such the above are proffered.  I do not
mean in a book *about* ""secular humanism"" by some yo-ho like Phyllis
Shafley or Jimmy Swaggart.  I mean in a manifesto *by* so-called ""secular
humanists"" identifying themselves as such.  I suspect you will find these
charges are harder to prove than the popularists would tell you.

Ray, it's about time you STARTED thinking, and presenting facts.  I have yet
to see a single solitary one fact from you in all your articles.  Do you have
any to offer?  I think dispensing data about making sex safe and describing
alternatives to people IS the very purpose of an information center on sex,
and I for one am glad they do it.  Tell me, are you Ken Arndt in a new
location?  Or did Ken just give you lessons on how a rampant know-nothing

Lissen, Sargent, we had this discussion a loong time ago, in a newsgroup
far far away (I think it was net.singles.)
STOP SUPERIMPOSING YOUR OWN NEUROSES ON GAY PEOPLE, OK?
It is bad enough that we have to suffer through his ruminations on
childhood, divorce and his own sexual orientation, given that he dismisses
serious counseling as a valid option.  But it is outrageous that he should
take these peculiar, private explanations for his neuroses and paint gay people
with the same color.
DON'T TRY TO MAKE STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT ""GAY PEOPLE"" ARE LIKE, GIVEN YOUR

The mindless presumption of this guy seems endless.  Worst of all, you'll
take him to task for it, he'll allow that maybe he did overreach things a
bit, but it sure won't prevent him from making the same kind of statement
a few months later.

I think that you assume one hell of a lot.  I do not look on any women as
being in any respect my enemy, nor do any of the other gay people that I
associate with.  Also, since Gods love is for all, I think you make another
large assumption in assuming that gays do not have His power and support
throughout our entire lives (we particularly need His help to deal with
the homophobes misusing His name to oppress us).

belies your charge that he was only talking about himself.  Sargent has already
made the claim that he isn't a ""confirmed homosexual.""  If he limited his
comments to his own peccadillos, then I would just chalk it up to good 'ol

Sorry, but I still claim that homosexuality is a form of neurosis, and
neurosis is a result of sin -- holding to false beliefs about oneself and
one's environment.  There are many cases of homosexuals being delivered
from homosexuality by the power of God.  (I'll probably expand on this idea
when I respond to Richard Brower's article.)

Actually the last half of the first sentence is no longer true....  I am
seeing regularly a man who is now officially a minister, but whose previous
work was full-time marriage & family counseling; he is thus very helpful in
helping me sort out my relationship problems.  I used net.singles as a support
group because it's easier to trust people at a distance than people I see
regularly -- the distant ones can't do much to me, especially since by the
time I see their responses, my hurting emotional state has passed.

Perhaps in one way I am being a bit presumptive, since I've never actually
fallen into homosexuality full-fledgedly.  But I have had more struggles with
homosexual feelings than most people I've talked to; so I'm not 100% ignorant.
I do wonder why my statements provoke a flame.  It has been my experience that
heated denials often are a cover for a truth that the denier does not want
to accept or admit.  Might I suggest that you examine yourself and see if
perhaps, at bottom, you really do have some -- shall we say, reservations --
about homosexuality.

It's clear in Sargent's entire response to my article that he has missed
the point.  He still is writing out of befuddlement, amazed that anyone
could possibly take offense at his bizarre generalizations.  Regardless of
their origin (more on that later) his comments are akin to so-called
christians proseletyzing among Jews, so filled with self-righteousness that
they do not see their capacity for insult.  I make no comment on his last
paragraph here, except to repeat it, so it can stand off by itself, as
another example of the kind of ad-hominem double-talk and evasiveness we
see repeatedly coming from the fundamentalist corner.
I received a response by mail to my first comment on Jeff's article:

This just about sums it up.  I have no problem hearing Jeff's explanations
of his own mental processes, but he needs to understand that only Jeff works
like Jeff, and to assume otherwise is to invite misunderstanding.  To then
publically propose this as the mechanism by which 10% of the population
operates, is to provoke anger and flames.  I speak up here against Jeff
Sargent's view of gay people, not because, as he so glibly states, that
I have ""reservations about homosexuality"", but because *someone* needs
to state the contrary--a statement like his should not go unchallenged.

I will admit that once a gay man explained his homosexuality to me as
follows (approximate quote from memory):  ""If you are like most straight
men [as distinct from comedians? :-)], the idea of having sex with a man
just doesn't appeal to you.  Now imagine feeling that way about women.""
I will try to remember to refrain from trying to make sweeping judgments
about the source of sexual preference, though I do still invite you to
examine that of yours more closely.  But I still call it a ""preference"".
I have several times read accounts by homosexuals who came to the point
where they hated their homosexual lifestyle (e.g. because it provided
virtually no genuine human contact), and by giving themselves to Christ
they were able to become happy, fulfilled heterosexuals.  If you actually
like being homosexual, and have actual human contact (soul touching soul
and spirit touching spirit, not just body contact) in that lifestyle, then
Christ may have a hard time convincing you that there's something better.
Your last sentence does make an interesting point.  God is merciful enough to
help those who do not give themselves to him 100% (else who would ever be
helped?); He may also help those who have not experienced faith in Him at
all.  (I'm not sure which category you fit in.)

Amazing how Jeff gleaned from such an account that women would be perceived
as enemies by gays.  I would assume that this means that Jeff thinks of all
men as HIS enemies, by this same logic.  (After all, he wouldn't want to
have sex with them, would he?)

There are a lot of people of all sexual (and other) persuasions who live lives
with virtually no human contact; that's one of the tragedies of our modern
society in many ways.  Unfortunately, I see many heterosexuals (and
homosexuals) being quite accepting of this, which is perhaps sadder.  Such
non-contact may not be the status quo, but to varying degrees it permeates all
strata of society.  Jeff's last sentence sounds so strained, as though he
doesn't believe the parenthetical could ACTUALLY be possible.  What is this
""something better"" than ""actual human contact""?  I surmise that it is ""better""
only by your own subjective perspective and presupposition about what SHOULD
be ""best"", such as when you made your statement about ""sex is intended as a
total union"":  who told you the intentions of the intender, and what's more
where do you get off assuming that there IS an ""intender"" and that it has the
same motives that you have?

Actually, much of the problem with being a homosexual has to do with the fact
that the oppression of gay people has been an American rallying point for
generations.  Many more gay relationships would be successful if we were
not told by all you ""good"" folks that all we are into is 'body contact'.
Your relationships are 'blessed by God' and good... my relationship is banal?
There you go with another assumtion.  Why doesn't my life partener qualify
for company health insurance... he is the wrong sex.
Well, I'll get by, but it is more difficult... and compared to a few years ago,
things are easy today.

As for the above paragraph, it is yet another example of intolerance.  Not
only are the mainstream prodestant denominatins (of which you are fairly
obviously not a member) currently reaching out to the gay community, with
the understanding that gays are not automaticly doomed, but several
Christian groupings are being formed by gay people.  Gays have often been
good Christians, although 'straight' churchs have had a great deal of trouble
dealing with us.  For some real Christian spirit, join your local Metropolitan
Community Church, even if only for a few services.  Communion is open to all
believers and everyone is invited to participate.

I'll bite.  Given that the homosexual (it could also be any person,
Christian, Jew, Moslem, Atheist, Bahai, heterosexual or any-other-sexual
you can imagine) does not disrupt work by bringing their personal
ideosyncracies into the workplace, then they should win the suit.
Simple enough?
The funny thing, Brunson, is that you probably have non-heterosexuals
(interesting word) working for you now, or will have them working
for you in the future and you won't know it.  I'd also guess that
there are lots of people you'd refuse to hire thinking they were gay
who, in fact, are not.  It's ironic that you aren't discriminating
on the basis of sexual preference, but on the basis of honesty.

To answer your question, the person who refuses to hire homosexuals
should lose, and the homosexual should win.  ""Should"" means that, in
my opinion, this is what I believe is more just.
The problem is that the employer wishes to hire only people who he/she is
comfortable having around, while the person looking for work wishes to
have access to any job based only on their ability, not the personal
preferences of the employer.  I believe that it is more important for
the employee to be protected from discrimination than it is for the
employer to be allowed to discriminate.

If quoting random statistics and journals is to be thought of as evidence
of intelligence (or as evidence of having something reasonable to say), then
it's no wonder certain people get elected to high office.  Arndt may be
""flashy"" in that he shows people the TRAPPINGS of intelligence and reason,
but if that alone gives the impression that he really IS intelligent or that
he actually has something important to say, then perhaps he's well suited to
go into advertising (or more likely propaganda).  Don't let people like Arndt
or Brunson or Bickford snow you.  Look what the Germans got when they fell for
it.  Look what we're getting.
If they produce random quotings of ""authorities"" instead of facts, if
they can't justify their own requests for justification by others, if the
sum and total of all their logic is a ridiculous emotional appeal designed to
make you believe notions that have no logical basis in fact, then just ignore
them.  Or else point them out for what they are.

Fine.  Now, explain to us why you feel your positions are valid, why
people's rights to have the sexuality of their own choosing, the
beliefs of their own choosing, etc., are not ""truly legitimate causes"".
(I think asking for a logical reason behind a position is the quickest
way to silence those who have nothing to say.)
As I've tried to say before, one fights for the rights of a group
oppressed for no good reason, NOT because one wants to ""liberate"" a
particular group, but rather because one wants to make sure that
groups and individuals of any kind will no longer be oppressed for
any reason.  As such, the fact that people seem to have to fight for
these things anew with each generation is the real ""slap in the face""
of the aforementioned people.
(Of course, that's why social reformers of the '60s are the YUPPIES of
today, who find it no longer appropriate to fight for the personal freedoms
of others because they've gotten theirs---along with their Cuisinarts...  )

to renounce their heterosexuality (some religious nuns, priests, brothers,

	As for an employer's right to treat homosexuality as an
""objectionable behavior,"" it seems to me that he should only treat
this as an objectionable behavior **IF IT INTERFERES WITH THE

This is not the issue, by your own example.  What we are talking about
is essential civil rights as guaranteed by the Constitution and upheld
by the supreme court.  There are lots of people in this world whose
activities I dislike;  Nazis, Moonies, prostelytizing right-wing Chris-
tians, wife-beaters, people who rip articles out of library periodicals,
jaywalkers, creationists, trekkies and people who post to multiple
newsgroups to name a few.  It is my right to dislike them, but it is
not my right to abridge their rights as members of this society because
of that dislike.
I don't believe anyone, but you, is talking about giving gays
""protected minority"" status in the legal sense of the word.  Minority
quotas, contract obligations and so forth are *your* Phyllis Shlaflyisms
designed to conjure meaningless spectres in others minds.  A lie is
a lie not only when it is about fact, but when it is about potential.

An interesting issue arises from the fundamentalists' concentration

another man.  Rather, a large component of gay life revolves around
life with one's SO and the friendships and acquaintanceships one forms
day-to-day.  (Just like everyone else; the fate of net.motss is to
constantly rehash the obvious.)  Indeed, though I would not prefer it
for myself, it is entirely possible to be celibate and gay.  Where do
these people stand before the fundamentalist judge (hmmn, do I mean

By ignoring the latter group completely, since there is no reason why
a group who simply believes something to be ""an abomination"" has the
right to impose that view on other people who believe otherwise, and
no reason why they should be ""accommodated"".  As witnessed by their

The ultimate goal of ""civil rights rhetoric"" is to have a world in which
NO ONE is discriminated against for arbitrary malicious reasons (which is
the only type of reason that has been offered).  The ultimate goal is
not to include any group onto a list of ""protected minorities"", but rather
to eradicate malicious discrimination by people who simply don't like
certain classes of people for whatever empty reason.  In a world in which
people continue to behave with the level of consideration for other human
beings that would make Jesus Christ spin in his grave, why shouldn't you
be penalized for your malice towards groups of people who think and behave
differently than you do?

Apparently you also haven't learned the lesson of tolerance from that
book you keep telling the rest of us to read.  All you've gotten out
of it is a springboard for showing your supposedly higher level of
morality by decreeing that all should (must) follow it.

There's no need to protect such people.  If they refuse to offer consideration
to other human beings, why show any special extra consideration to them?
It's just like your examples:  blacks have no choice but to be black, so
you can't blame them for being black (blame them???), so it's wrong to
discriminate against them; on the other hand, homosexuals (and I guess
Jews, too, eh?) choose to be what they are, so it's OK to be intolerant of
them.  By your logic, you choose to be intolerant of other people for no
good reason, thus it's OK to discriminate against you.

Any interviews in which the personal private lives of the interviewees
are discussed are unethical.  People have won lawsuits based on claims
that they were not hired because the interviewer discussed personal or
religious beliefs, et al.  An ethical job interviewer would never concern
him/herself with such matters during an interview.  The rest of your scenario

discrimination and your contemptible patronizing attitude toward Jews.

And my proposition is that race, color, creeds should be irrelevant,
but not ""being named Brunson"".  Discrimination against persons based on
race or creed is an abomination, but discrimination against people named
Brunson (or those with other aberrant names) is OK.  My proposition is just
as worthy of consideration as yours:  it's equally arbitrary, equally
vacuous.  (By the way, which creeds were you leaving out?  The non-Judaeo/

This one isn't (though Arndt and Martillo might argue about my Jewishness).
(At times like this I always recall, and always forget the name of, the
clergyman who said ""First they came for... but I was not... so I didn't speak
up"".  Of course I also forget the text itself.  If someone would be so kind...)
The ""tactic"" being engaged in is YOURS:  the crux of your argument is that
YOU don't like homosexuals, thus you have a right to discriminate against
them.  The word, discrimination, when taken to its logical extreme (as it
often is when it is unchecked), *should* trigger the response you describe
for ANY group being unjustly discriminated against.

I take ""personally harmful"" to mean that YOU judge it to be harmful to
a given individual because YOU find it repugnant.  If you liked eating
chocolate, and I (and others) found that practice repugnant, and
discriminated against you for engaging in it, would that make sense?
(I know, not a good way to phrase a question directed at an Arndt clone.)

The goal of advancing minority rights is NOT to make lists of protected
minorities (""OK, discriminating against blacks, Jews, ... that's wrong because
they fought and paid their dues and are now 'legitimate minorities',  but
discriminating against gays, atheists, people named Brunson, that should be

I see.  That is, I see that you have changed the scenario to
give your position more credibility and power.
The point, however, is still  that  you  have  discriminated
against  one person because of his sexual preference and and
for another because of her religious preference.  This makes
for  discrimination on grounds which are illegal.  No matter
what you feel about it you and your business could easily be
liable for prosecution.

Whoa!  Homosexuality does not constitute prima facie evidence for sodomy
nor is sodomy a practice restricted to gays.  Granted that specific forms
of sexual behavior may be against the law and that you have the right to
discriminate against those who break the law, it is incumbent upon *you*
to prove the violation.  Innocence without proof of guilt is a right that
everyone enjoys, fortunately, though it appears you would like to change
that.
(You would be amazed at the sexual practices that are against the law in
North Carolina -- as a monogamous happily married person I regularly violate
state statutes.  Fortunately only Jesse Helms is interested in prosecuting
these sorts of things.)

The title of this article represents the oft-heard rationale of those who
resist social change:  why not leave things as they are?  The corollary to
this occurs in times when social progress is growing, and the changes that
this progress causes requires some adjustment on the part of other people
who formerly didn't have bother thinking about the people their behavior
was affecting.  That corollary is:  why don't we go back to the old ways
when things were better, when everyone knew their place, etc.?
1.  What Brunson calls a warped morality is, in fact, a morality prescribing
	the right of all human beings to live as they please, provided that
	their actions do not interfere with or violate another person's rights.
	Brunson may argue that HIS right to interfere in other people's lives
	is being violated (his right to discriminate).  Yet that is clearly
	not one of the ""rights"" this very simple, minimal and rational morality
	includes.  Is there anyone who finds fault with such a morality?  Why?
2.  If a society is based on the exploitation/oppression/dehumanization/
	ignoring of an element(s) of that society, on some arbitrary basis
	(""They're not human, they're slaves.""  ""They don't believe in the
	REAL god.""  ""They do *weird* things."" ""... thus they can't vote,
	can't expect equal treatment, etc.""), then the sudden/gradual
	realization of the equalness/humanity of that element, that group
	of people, is going to cause changes in the society.  (""You mean
	we won't have slaves to work in our fields anymore?"" ""You mean *they*
	are going to working in *our* company?""  ""You mean I have to work/live
	with/near one of *them*?"", etc.)  If a tenet of the societal morality
	is truly to treat all people equally, even those who formerly were
	not, then the changes are to be expected.  A fact of life.
3.  I'd still like to see the difference between Jews/blacks/women(""legitimate""
	minorities) and homosexuals (non-""legitimate"" minorities).  I'd also
	like to know what Brunson's notion of a protected minority is.  If
	all people are to be treated equally and not discriminated against,
	why are certain groups considered ""protected""?
4.  The battle cry ""let's get things back to the way they were"", an appeal
	to those affected negatively by these changes, is most often a call
	to fascism and repression.  Getting back to the old days will of
	necessity mean getting back to (actively) repressing the newly 
	emancipated groups of people.  Such people are not satisfied until
	they can repress just about everyone other than themselves.  Then there
	are those like that clergyman who said ""First they came for the gays,
	but I was not gay, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the Jews,
	but I was not a Jew, so I didn't speak up; then they came for the
	communists, but I was not a communist, so I didn't speak up; ... then
	they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.""  (BAD
	PARAPHRASE---could someone please send me the original text and the
	name of the speaker)

Actaully, it depends somewhat on how the constitution is interpreted as
to waether or not it is legal to discriminate against anyone!  And I'm glad
to say that those few states that still have sodomy laws are having them
struck down by the courts if they won't get their own house in order.
Currently Texas is in court over the issue.

Your religion should be practiced everywhere, why do you not follow it?
Remember Jesus's ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""?  Why do you not practice
the second most important commandment, according to the benchmark of the
man you try to pattern your life after.

You are a bigot and a hypocrate.  You should not be allowed to let the effects
of the former ruin other people's lives.  You should think about the latter
and ask if Jesus wants his church run on that basis.

If you start saying that ""homosexuality is not a good thing because

	Let's be very carefull when we make comparisons between humans

	fun.  The animals may very well think that they are procreating
	and just have their wires crossed.  One expects odd behavior from
	rats if they are placed in an overcrowded environment... an
	'unatural' environement if you will.
 
	On the other hand, many animals (rats too) can learn to modify

	story about the bull on her uncle's (?) farm is an example that
	could be interpreted wither way.
It was my great-grandfather's farm, but that is not the point. Your
whole argument does not wash. There are human societies that have yet
to connect sex with babies. (I heard a lecture on one group of them
last week -- they are in New Guinea.) Do you really expect that the
rats do? 
However, it really outlines what it is that some people mean by
""natural"". They mean that if you aren't going ""rah rah procreate!""
all the time, then your sex is unnatural. By that definition, I don't
know a single heterosexual couple that counts as natural.
Now where could this idea, not that the humans *ought* to be thinking
of sex-as-for-procreation-only (an idea which isn't even in favour
with the middle-of-the road Catholics in Toronto!), but that the
animals *already are* have come from? Let me think.
I may be wrong, but my hunch is that it comes from Genesis 1:22
-- the old ""be fruitful and multiply bit"".  
If this is so, then you have just defined ""natural"" to mean ""in
accordance with my interpretation of the Christian Bible"". This
sure isn't my definiton of the word natural, and I am sure that it
is not the one that most people use.
I have a smaller definiton of ""natural"" than Tim Maroney's (for
instance, if there were no wild colonies of rats that exhibited
that lab behaviour, I would be willing to concede that that was not
natural behaviour for rats) but not so small as to consist of 
somebody else' interpretation of his Holy Book. 
(By the way, lemmings exhibit homosexual behaviour every 7 (I think)
years, under overcrowded situations. Of course they are the same
animals that every seven years ""swarm"" <much like bees> to
form new colonies due to overpopulation. In lemming swarms, there
is a lot of dinners provided for the Arctic foxes and wolves,
and a lot of lemmings simply dive into the ocean and start swimming for
the other side. They drown, leading people to beliefs of lemming
mass suicides.)
Now. If you want to argue about ""correspondance to my interpretaion
of Holy Book X"", that is fine. BUT -- not in net.motss, which
is read by a lot of people who don't care about ""Holy Book X"".
And consider that what you are actually arguing about is not the
NATURALNESS of homosexuality, but the MORALITY of homosexuality.

>The strings that some women wear on the beach nowadays 
>only do one thing...tease
This is the  second  article  of  this  general  nature  I've  seen  posted
recently.  Since  others  have already posted appropriate flames in reply I
thought I'd have a  try  at  analyzing  the  underlying  attitude  implied.
Perhaps the original posters can gain some insights while recovering in the
burn ward.
Come, let us reason together ...
It's been my experience that very few women deliberately set out  to  tease
and  frustrate men for the fun of it.  When a man feels teased it's usually
because a woman isn't responding to him  in  the  manner  _he_  thinks  she
should.  The  logic  seems  to run something to the effect of ""I'm sexually
attracted to you {for whatever reason},  therefore  you  are  obligated  to
fulfill  my  fantasy."".  There's  also  some ego-protection going on in the
form of ""There's nothing wrong with me, so your rejection of me must be  an
act designed to tease."".
Reasoning like the above can lead an otherwise intelligent man to  conclude
he's  being  teased  because an attractive woman is wearing beach attire at
the beach.
I've learned to avoid the  pain  and  frustration  of  these  fallacies  by
keeping one simple principle in mind:
     _Any_ woman has the right to say ""NO"" and mean it _any  time  she
     wants  to_  and  _need  not  justify_  her  reasons for doing so.
     Period.  Paragraph.
Any man who refuses to accept and honor this principle is no better than  a
common rapist.
If a man thinks he's been or being teased he has a perfect right  to  leave
the  situation  and  have nothing further to do with the woman in question.
He _does not_ have _any_ right to force his attentions on her or in any way
try to make her behave as he thinks she should.
Now a thought experiment for the male readers:
Imagine you are 5'2"" tall and weigh 100 lbs.  You are an attractive man and
dress accordingly.  While sunning on the beach, in your bikini swim suit, a
6'4"", 200 lb. homosexual man walks  up  and  tries  to  pick  you  up.  You
politely  decline  but  he  refuses  to  leave  and begins to show signs of
irritation at your continued rejections.  He finally leaves in a huff,  and
half  an hour later the same thing happens with a different man.  This goes
on all the time you're at the beach, every time your at the beach.
Ladies:  Is the above a fair analogy?
[Note: The above is in no way intended to represent the behavior of gay men
       as a group or any particular individual.]

No, I got the point the first time.  I just think that the sort of
non-objective thinking that produces concepts such as ``harrassment
is in the eyes of the harassee'' is cruel.  If you actually
go around thinking this way, then I suggest you change your way of
thinking, and as fast as you can, because you are probably being
extremely hard on the people around you in your life.  They are in
the unenviable position of having to read your mind before they can
determine whether their efforts are going to be considered humourous
or harrassment. 
This is one heavy load to expect hald the human race to carry.  Face
it, the world is full of lonely men who would dearly like to meet
a member of the opposite sex with whom they can get along.  Remarks
like this only serves to let them know that they have to go at it
blind.  What one woman will call ``humourous'' another will call
``harrassment''.  When some women say ``Leave me alone.'' they mean,
``buzz off, buster, I'm not interested'' -- and others mean ``if you
work real hard, I will be nice to you, but I'm going to make you work
very hard, because I am shy, or interested in having you prove yourself
to me or...''  It is all very unappetising.    It makes you want to stay 
home and hack on your editor, and give up on meeting women altogether.
Luckily for those lonely women out there, most guys are lonely enough
to run through the mill again and again, still looking for someone they
can understand well enough to like, and eventually love.  (Others,
of course, give up on like altogether.  They fall in love on the bus,
in class, at work, on the street...this is a hard way to live, but
I suspect better than concluding that the other half of the race is
too irrational to go out with -- after all, they are bound to run into
a good one after a while.)
Can't you see that it is *really*, *really*, *rotten* to hand this
out to people at large?  Most readers of this list (like most men,
surprise!) have no interest in harrassing women on the beach.
Meeting them, yes. Taking to them, yes. Persuing the acquaintance,
maybe. Something more than that? also maybe.  But almost nobody gets up
in the morning and says ``Hey! Let's go down to the beach and harrass
some women!!'' 
So the readers of this list are waiting, with bated breath, to figure
out how it is that you go down to the beach, meet women, and don't
harrass them.  They have a nice strong interest in this.  And what
do they get?  They get told that the whole situation is hopeless.
If random-female doesn't like the way you look, or the way you dress,
or whatever, she will consider your opening line harrassment.  If
she likes you, then she will not.
Seems rather hard on the ego of poor old average-guy-wanting-to-meet
-someone-on-the-beach.  No matter what you do, sucker, I can still
get you for harrassment!  I find this really, really, really mean.
All I can hope is that the problem is that, for all the talk of
women's liberation, the people who say such things haven't ever
taken the big step of approaching men to whom they are attracted and
waiting to see if they are going to get an ego-crushing rejection.
(Which probably won't happen.  Men, being well aware of this as a big
source of anxiety try to let you down gently, when they try to let
you down at all.  Most of the men which I have asked out have been
so overwhelmed at the ego-stroke of having *somebody else* ask *them* 
out that that is enough to make them accept.  Things will even out
over time, as more women ask more men out, but right now things are
pretty unbalanced.)
In the meantime, I still see this horrible double-standard. There is
all this talk about ``insensitive men'' and ``sensitive caring women''
but I wonder -- are those women only caring about other women?  Labelling
men as harrassers, without providing objective standards for harrassment
goes pretty high on my ``insensitive'' list.  Perhaps the problem is
that many women cannot see beyond ``he said something which I didn't
like'' to ``I wonder why he said that?''  It is easy to scream
harrassment whenever you don't get what you want, but hardly fair.
Never attribute to malice what is easily explained by stupidity, and
remember -- while you are not obliged to like every man that comes
around, the ones you don't like aren't obliged to live in a hole
either.  And you can't find their very existence harrassing -- just
as they can't find your existence harrassing.
ps -- for any men who have managed to read this far.  Try real hard
	to forget the notion that if a woman rejects you it is because
	you have ULTIMATE LOSER scribbled across your face in a way

	hell.  the next ten also hurt. From then on, it is not so

Hi Chris.  How you doing?  Write to me and tell me what globetek is.
I agree with you that life is full of context sensitive things.  My
point of contention is over ``if I don't like it, then it is
harrassment''.  Harrassment is serious stuff -- that somebody you think
is unattractive is attracted to you is inconvenient, but in no way
that serious.  I guess I am here for purity of language, more than
anything.  It is hard enough to communicate with people as it is
without having the meanings of words slip out from under you as you
speak.  A certain amount of linguistic change happens all the time,
but that does not mean that ``more is better''  and we should all
plunge headlong into 1984 where people cannot communicate because
all the words are too overloaded -- and more words are disappearing
every year.
That some people are going to get upset when perfectly good and reasonable
people approach them, I can understand.  But if they can't tell the
difference between ``I'm upset'' and ``I am being harrassed'' then
they have a very serious problem.  After all, sexual harrassment is
the sort of thing that you sue people for.  But you don't sue people
because they are attracted to you and you find them unnattractive.
But if people can't keep it straight in their mind what harrassment
is, and mistake it for being upset ,then there are going to be a lot
of unneccesary lawsuits...

Nope -- he is upset.  Now if you are in a conspiracy with the other 17
people to drive him up the wall, you are harrassing him -- otherwise,
he is just upset. Unfortunate, yes. Upset, yes. With good cause -- maybe.
But you haven't harrassed him.

But that *is* the question.  That is why I asked for an objective
standard for harrassment -- not for ``feeling harrassed'' -- but for
actually harrassing people.

Holy Cow. I can't believe some of the discussions that get started in
this group. But as long as you, ah, mentioned it ...
Who SEZ a woman's body should be smooth and clean? Who SEZ a man
should let his armpit hair grow down until he can tie it to his
shoelaces? We're talking cultural and personal preferences here,
folks. Know what's REALLY disgusting when it comes to hair? Those 
guys who have dense clumps of hair growing from their noses and
ears who refuse to trim them ... (yuck, yuck, spit! this is getting
disgusting! :-)
There are certain males who find that armpit hair on a female is a
turn-on. I suspect you find more of them in Europe than in the USA. Is
one preference 'better' than the other? Of course not. No cultural
preference 'should' be the way it is; it just is. An American female 
who chooses to cornrow her leg hair and shave her head bald will, I'll 
wager, find SOME American males who find it a turn-on. And an American
male who chooses to dye his hair flourescent green and put a crowbar
through his nose will find SOME American females who think he's the
bee's knees. Chacun a son gout. There's somebody for everyone, Joe.

  This is a crock. Yes, I'll call you paranoid, but it does not ""serve"" me
to do so. What this really is is sexism and stereotyping, exactly the
same thing I hear you complaining so bitterly against when practiced by men.
Listen to yourself. You are putting all men into a class based on their gender.
If that isn't sexism, I don't know what is. If you want to create a non-sexist
world (a goal I am 100% for, because believe it or not society also has
expectations about what a MAN should or shouldn't do, some of which I find
as objectionable as you apparently do those about women) you could start
by not practicing it yourself.
   I think you are giving a lot of ignorant jerks a lot more credit than they
deserve. This whole notion that all men deliberately subjogate all women
is ridiculous, and propogating it only serves to give the few who really
*are* trying to dominate an ""excuse"" to do so.

Phrases like ``legitimite prejudice'' kind of dull the meaning of both
words, don't they?  The question is one of reality.  And he is dead-on-the
money -- boys do better than girls at math, men do better than women
at math -- on a statistical basis.  You can find women who do very
well at math, but, statistically speaking, this is rare.  this is a
big topic of discussion for proghfessional educators -- I've waded
through mounds and mounds of discussion on the subject.  Is the reason
for this due to differences between the male and female brain?  is it
due to the fact that mathematical ability is encouraged by playing with
blocks and legos and girls don't get enough of these as children? Is
it that girls mature and get interested in boys earlier than boys do and
then stop competing with boys in the classroom because it is perceived to be
unfeminine?  Because math classes are boring in general, but boys are more
programmed to stick it out than girls are through their conditioning?
I have read study after study, and I have no idea whether there is any
truth in any of them.  But to dismiss it as a prejudice is to ignore that
it is going on, as if it is the fault of the math teachers (most of
whom are overjoyed to get an enthusiastic student, of whatever sex.)

Holy smokes, by the time you get to university you had better be immune to
``I care more about what the teacher thinks about me than about the 
subject itself'' disease.  Especially in mathematics classes.  Remember,
what he is looking for is people who are so enthusiastic about their
subject that they don't care if the teacher is a walrus.   it is this
type of student which he finds is almost never female -- and this type
of student doesn't care what the teacher's opinion of them is, if they
ever notice it.

It is an accurate representation of reality -- what is.  It is better to
walk around with concepts which mirror the world that is rather than
the world you would like to live in.  Is he expected to choose the things
he believes in on the basis of what it accomplishes for you -- or on the
basis of what is true?

  I agree that there are men out there that are like this. All stereotypes
persist because there are at least some who fit them. But the statement
""threaten male dominance IN GENERAL"" (emphasis mine) seems to indicate
the way the original author thiks, i.e. very sexist.

We were discusisng this in net.politics.theory a while ago.  I still think
that sexism and racism involve the assumption that a person is *inferior*
based on he/r membership in a group.   Not everybody who reads politics
theory agrees with me.
Men have penises thus is not sexist.  Blacks have black hair is not racist.
(They have the same flaws as all generalisations --  castrated men are
still men,  and Blacks who bleach ther hair are still Blacks.)  I don't
think ``most mathematicians are men'' is sexist either -- it is reality.
``Most mathematicians are men because almost no women can think logically''
*is* sexist.
I get very worried about political movements which can't tell the difference
between a statement of fact and a slur.  Are their perceptions so warped
by their ideology that they cannot perceive what is?

I think it's probably a matter of viewpoint. If a group thinks all
other groups' capabilities represent the normal range but that IT 
happens to be wildly *superior* to all other groups, does that qualify 
as racism/sexism/etc.? But then again, I guess this is claiming that
EVERYONE ELSE is inferior, so perhaps my definition of racism/sexism
is too weak to be really useful...

   This is not only a ""travesty"" that just took place, it is a CONTINUING
thing. The problem is that people are focusing on an ideal net instead of
the real thing. The real issue is not whether some people should or shouldn't
post to a given group; the FACT is that you CAN'T KEEP THEM OUT. So, it's
pointless to argue whether men should post to net.women, or married persons
should post to net.singles; we couldn't stop them even if we wanted to.
I fail to see why people in net.women complain; because the reality of the net
caused the group (and the subsequent net.women.only) to fail in its *original*
purpose (which was a non-hostile forum to discuss feminist issues), the 
feminist mailing list was created. This list has been HIGHLY successful in
providing such a forum. Those people who really want to keep out ""hostile""
points of view should consider joining or starting a mailing list or creating
a moderated newsgroup.

I'm in the second group. I'll be 39 in January and have lived alone
for about five years now. You should know that we're far MORE
intolerant and self-indulgent than you could ever imagine; why, I just
HATE people who accuse me of being intolerant and self-indulgent!
That's why I never, never talk to other people or let them into my
life! And as for self-indulgence, why, I'll show you self-indulgence,
buddih: I'm going to go out and buy a lobster dinner and eat it ALL BY
MYSELF and not even invite anyone to share it with me! So THERE!
(Oh, and by the way, :-)
No one is ready for a sustained and giving relationship with another
person until he is happy with his own life and likes and respects
himself as a person. Many people spend their youth frantically
searching for a One True Love; a few find a relationship that lasts
for a substantial period of time; many live dissatisfied after the
initial sexual glow wears off; many more flit from relationship to
relationship searching for a One True Love that is a grand lie foisted
on us by a thousand-year-old European romantic tradition and mass
media that are as obsessed with selling True Love as with selling Sex
(The long sad history of the True Love myth will have to await another
posting). The relationships that last are the result of plain old hard 
work and dedication, folks, with a small element of luck thrown in. 
There's nothing magical about sex OR love. 
There's also nothing about living by myself that changes me magically
into a different person if I don't 'share my life' with someone else
by having them in constant proximity to my person. Like, wow, you've
been living by yourself for five years now; you'd better find a
housemate or SO soon, or you'll become too INTOLERANT and SELF-INDULGENT 
to ever do it again! A-and all those close friendships with other 
people don't count: you've got to have them under your roof to stave 
off these twin menaces!
Someone very close to me is on his third marriage. It's precisely his 
intolerance and self-indulgence that doomed his first two marriages,
and I'm terribly afraid it's going to happen again. He was married the
first time at 18, and has been unattached for only a few months
between marriages. So don't give me any crap about how having an SO
makes one tolerant and generous. Life doesn't fit into pigeonholes,

Nope. You're misinterpreting what I'm saying. Many people feel they
can't live by themselves because they're insecure or immature. Or
because they feel that life without an SO is less than satisfying.
These people approach potential relationships with a lot of fantasies
built up in their heads that a new relationship will somehow make
their life better. A relationship based on fantasy will sooner or
later come to a bad end. My claim is that a person who is happy with
his own life is secure and mature, and will approach relationships
with realistic expectations.

Cynicism? I don't think so. What seems like cynicism to you seems like
realism from my side of the fence.
Note that 'disillusioned' literally means free from illusion or false 
ideas. It's precisely our American illusions about the nature of love
that I believe have led to the brief lifespan of so many relationships
in our society. I wasn't denying that falling in love can be an
overwhelming experience, and one of the most delightful sensations in
life. But True Love has become a fetish in our society, and the
'magic' I was criticising is the false magic of the fetish. Hasn't anyone
ever said to you when you've come off a failed relationship that it
wasn't really TRUE Love, and that you'd KNOW True Love when it came
along?
The myth is this: There is a small number of people out there for each
of us (and perhaps only one) whose natures are so sympatico with ours
that meeting one of them is like having an electric shock of recognition 
run through your frame as you realize: This Is The One I will spend all 
my days with. Many people, doomed never to meet their Perfect Mates,
settle for less. The implication is that marriage to a Perfect Mate is
based on True Love and is likely to last Forever since the initial
'magic' is bound to remain at its original intensity for an indefinite
period of time. 
The True Love myth may have had its origins in the courtly love 
tradition 'way back in the early middle ages. The relationship of a 
knight for his lady was supposed to be a mirror on earth of the 
relationship of a Christian to the mother of God. You might call it 
the ultimate pedestalization of woman. Books were written advising 
people on the proper approach to love; The Art Of Courtly Love by 
Cavalcanti is one famous book of the time, and Dante Alighieri's love 
for Beatrice as he described it in La Vita Nuova is also a model of 
this type of love. The idea is that these people were talking about 
a mystical and idealized form of love that was a lower-order form of 
the love a Christian was supposed to have for Mary, the mother of God. 
Now, this love was at the same time sexual, so you had a mixture of 
the sacred and the profane that the Church found quite threatening. 
It soundly condemned the courtly love 'fad,' and the medieval Trobadour 
was an almost Dylanesque figure operating at the fringes of what was 
respectable.
Needless to say, our current True Love myth retains a shadow of the
notion that lovers are striving for some idealized and quasi-mystical
state. Is this coincidence, or have we inherited a modified courtly
love tradition from medieval Europe through tradition and/or the arts?
I don't know. What's interesting in this context, however, is the
stylized nature of our OWN 'courtly love' myth and its similarity to
the medieval myth. If nothing else, it's a striking example of
convergent evolution (I suspect a more direct connection, however; I
just can't prove it yet).
Our attitudes toward love are also culture-bound. If you doubt this,
go take a good course or two in anthropology. Some languages (Japanese, 
for example, which uses a borrowed word) don't even HAVE a word that 
corresponds to our notion of romantic love. Some cultures view love as 
a form of mental illness whose sufferers are to be pitied until they 
get better. Other cultures view it as a phenomenon of adolescence that 
people outgrow. The belief in the 'magic' of love is hardly a cultural
universal. Many societies view the marital bond as a conjoining of
families; love has little or nothing to do with it.
If you doubt the reality and power of the True Love myth, spend a day 
listening to top-40 songs, reading romance novels, and watching 'romantic'
stories on the television. As a society, we're positively inundated by
pro-True Love propaganda. 
The result is that it's easy to look at rough spots in a relationship
or at a less-than-perfect SO after the initial sexual glow has worn
off and convince yourself that it wasn't True Love after all and
merrily go out to continue your search for the Real Thing. This may be
one of the reasons why so many people seem reluctant to WORK at a 
relationship with problems these days: it's much easier to convince
yourself it wasn't 'real' and go on to something else.
Will I fall in love again? Without a doubt. Will I get involved in
another long-term relationship? I won't rule it out. But I certainly
won't delude myself into thinking that our feelings for each other
will forever stay the same, or that the relationship won't involve
hard work and constant communication if it's to last. I'm not a cynic;
I simply don't have any illusions about what love is or how it works
its alleged 'magic.'

Let's turn that around: Once you learn *to* need someone else,
how do you learn to be happy alone?

This is worded slightly, but significantly than it usually is.
The version I usually hear is that you are supposed to be happy
BY yourself. (e.g. alone)  Bullmodems!  People are social critters,
we need friends, affection, love, etc.  Most people can handle being
alone for short periods of time, some can handle long periods.
(short and long being intentionally undefined)  But to claim that
everyone should be happy alone for long periods of time is totally
bogus.  Becky's version, however, I agree with.  You do need to be
happy with yourself to be truely happy with anything.  Which isn't
to say that one should avoid relationships until you are happy with
yourself.  The relationship may be exactly what you need to become
happy with yourself, avoiding it could be a catch-22 situation.

I fail to see where sex and love are more than glandular responses and
bonding behavior, physical sensations that evolved to guarantee the
preservation of genetic material and mutual cooperation in the raising
of young. All the other stuff ('magic') is myth-making, something we
humans are all too good at. I don't deny that sex and love can lead to
some of the most pleasant physical and mental states the organism can
attain, and I don't think you see the point of what Isaac and I were
saying. I suggest you might want to reread our postings.
Do I think I will personally fall in love again? Yes. Do I think it
will be an overwhelming experience? Yes. Do I think those feelings
will last forever at their initial intensity? Probably not. Do I think
True Love has a magical property outside its obvious origins in
glandular secretions and chemical/electrical phenomena in the brain?
Definitely not.
>Isaac and Bill, if all you want your SO to be is a good
>friend then you probably won't find *any* magic at all, in anything.
>Any sapient being should be able to distinguish between lovers and
>friends.
Over the long haul, one's behavior toward an SO almost invariably changes.
The physical attraction may lessen or there may be other problems in
the relationship. What gets a couple through these rough spots? It
ain't the evanescent magic, it's FRIENDSHIP and mutual respect for the
value of the relationship.
As to the difference between lovers and friends, it's a quantitative
thing based on the importance of sexual attraction in the
relationship. If two people describe themselves as lovers, they either
have sex regularly in their relationship or they think about having
sex regularly in their relationship. If they describe themselves as
friends, they probably don't have sex regularly in their relationship.
These are just relative labels we use to tell other people something 
about our relationships and about our availability for new 
relationships, not labels that describe cut-and-dried phenomena.
 
>I think that there is a real return to romance in the 80's.  
I think you probably realize by now that at least some of us in this
group think this is unfortunate, especially if by 'romance' you mean
the reification of the True Love Myth.

I believe the need people are talking about originates in fear: the
fear that one can't make it on one's own, the fear that one will never
have another relationship like the one that's missing, etc. I wasn't
denying that the feeling that life has lost its savor is normal;
what's NOT normal is that feeling continuing beyond a finite period of
mourning. And I think the belief that such continued obsession is
normal is dangerous.

This again was my reaction to the word 'need' as you were using it,
and the 'you' here wasn't really meant to refer specifically to you,
Snoopy (God, am I REALLY talking like this to a cartoon character? :-), 
but to the general class of people who feel they 'need' a relationship. 
As to your previous article, I sometimes have a hard time keeping up
with who has said what in these exchanges and don't really have a
clear understanding of the Life Philosophies of all the participants.
So if I've misinterpreted your stance I apologize.
 
>The original used the word 'need', I left it in when turning it around.

That's one of the hazards of posting to the net: unless you're precise
about what you say (whoops, unless ONE is precise about what ONE says)
you're liable to misinterpretation. I believe you personally are not
obsessive about relationships, but don't assume the class of
net.singles readers in general are not. When a strong word like 'need'
is joined to 'relationship' it causes a lot of associations to spring
up in a net reader's mind. For me, it brings back painful and immature
postadolescent longings and fantasies I've long since grown out of, and 
my immediate reaction is to assume you're talking about the same thing.
The standard meaning of the word 'need' implies the needed something
is a prerequisite for happiness or health or well-being. As applied to
relationships, 'need' implies that a SO-less person is unhappy, unhealthy, 
and/or incomplete in some way. This was the sense of the word I was
strongly reacting to.

Ah, it seems you're evading the issue by redefining what we're talking 
about. Most people do not have the kind of relationship we were talking 
about (at least that I THOUGHT we were talking about) with their God 
or with nature or with their pets (unless they're kinky in the extreme, 
that is :-). I assumed we were talking about SEXUAL relationships, not 
general interactions with other living beings and inanimate objects. 
Apparently I was wrong. If this is the case, we've been talking about
two different things entirely.
But you'll also notice that I was addressing a particular ATTITUDE
toward relationships, the feeling that one MUST HAVE a relationship
with its associated insecurities (I'm not going to catalog them
again). It ain't the necessity of social intercourse I was talking
about but a longing and obsession that becomes a driving force in
one's life. A person whose entire life revolves around an obsession
with a house or a pet or a political cause is in just as much trouble
as a person who is obsessed with romantic relationships.
 
>Even if we limit the discussion to relationships with SOs, I
>still feel that they can be necessary, but won't claim taht they

Of course they can be necessary. My postings on this topic have
questioned whether this kind of need is an entirely healthy state. I
say no, you apparently say yes.
 
>Perhaps a big part of it is knowing that there is something better.
>Being alone just isn't as satisfying after having an SO.
>Like having to drive one of Detroit's rolling disaster areas after

I've eaten at some fine restaurants, and had meals there that make all
other meals pale in comparison: food cooked to perfection, artfully
balanced and presented. Now, there were a few possible reactions
to these intense sensations of culinary pleasure: I could decide that
no other eating experience could match them and devote my life to the
pursuit of the most sublime and refined cuisine on the face of the
earth, bankrupting myself in the process and alienating my family and
friends as I pursued my obsession; I could decide that this experience
comes only a few times in a lifetime, and resign myself to comparing
my ordinary meals to the absolute perfection I've known once or twice
in life, knowing that nothing I ever eat will ever match the bliss I
know is possible; lastly, I could realize that I very well may eat a
meal that will match the perfection of the two or three I've known,
decide that this will be very nice if it happens but that I won't get
crazy about it, and decide to appreciate the simple joys of a bowl of
oatmeal and a cup of tea out on the porch as the sun's coming up.
In short, I strongly disagree that being alone isn't as satisfying
once you've had an SO.

Consider a person like Mother Theresa, or anyone else who has
dedicated his/her life to helping the unfortunate. There are other
ways to achieve full enjoyment and fulfillment in life than through
a relationship with an SO, I believe. Since we're social beings, we
NEED other people; I'm not denying that. But I do deny that one needs 
a sexual/love relationship to be fully happy in life.

I don't really think it's a matter of keeping one's ""cool"" in a
relationship; one can fully experience passion in a love relationship
without abandoning one's good sense. And a shattered relationship
always hurts; it's how constructively one DEALS with the hurt that's
important, I think.
Anyone who decides to sign a marriage certificate without considering
the potential breakup of the relationship and its allied legal and
financial ramifications is a fool, for example. Being in love is no
excuse for abandoning one's ability to reason.

Apologies if I offend anyone's sensibilities with this, but the
sensation of orgasm is one of the most intensely pleasurable physical
sensations the organism is capable of. Evolution/God (pick your
favorite) has come up with an extraordinarily effective mechanism for
getting nervous systems to engage in reproductive behavior, n'est-ce
pas? Now imagine that it would be possible to experience this height
of pleasure continually, 24 hours a day. Would you choose to do so? I
certainly wouldn't: the intensity of orgasm for most humans is, I
think, enhanced by the experiences that precede and follow it. It
ain't as much fun without the dating, getting to know someone, the
pleasant evening and the foreplay, and waking up the next morning to
watch the sun rise together. Human experiences are, I think,
pleasurable in context, butted up against contrasting experiences (not
all of them as intense or pleasurable). Love would not be nearly as 
enjoyable if its intensity never lagged and picked up again, I think. 
You fall in love with someone, then the intensity of the experience 
decreases. But all of a sudden you see your partner turn in the light 
a certain way, or s/he says something that reveals a new strength or 
vulnerability, and Bingo: the feelings intensify back to where they 
were when you first met. After a relationship like this breaks up, 
everyday experiences can acquire a poignancy they don't ordinarily
have. For me, this can focus my attention on experiences I'd otherwise
ignore, and is an important part of getting through the mourning
process. It's a matter of learning to appreciate the little things
again for their own worth and stop measuring them against the
overwhelming intensity of the sensations that accompany what we call
love.

Sigh.  I was mainly talking about ""romantic"" relationships, which

He whose breath reeks of Mo Shu Alpo:
Need for a relationship has little to do with maturity, immaturity,
machismo, or shoe size. (In this beagle's opinion, anyway) Bill is
claiming that the need for a relationship is unhealthy.  Whether it
is unhealthy or not, many people (and beagles!) do need a relationship,
and we have to deal with that need somehow.  Being told that you
don't need what you know good and well that you *do* need is less than
helpful.
You can say that what we ""need"" consists of oxygen, water, food,
and in most climates, clothing and shelter.  This is what we require
to survive, not to live.  What we require to live is not as easily
defined.  It varies from person to person, and from time to time
throughout our lives.  It is also difficult to detirmine what we
need verses what we merely want.
I've been attempting to write about people in general, not about
my specific case.  (I'm a little strange, and things that are
true for me are often not true for people in general.)  Perhaps
there's a better word than ""need"", perhaps there isn't.  I'm
not a writer, ok?
To satisify George's curiosity, yes, I feel that I need a relationship.
Perhaps this need wouldn't be so strong if society wasn't so strongly
couple oriented.  But with most people coupled and only interested
in doing things with their SO (and kids) there's really noone else
to do anything with.  And many people who are single don't want to
""waste"" time with someone who ""isn't going to work out"".  And to add
insult to injury, the VAXen are usually down for backups on Friday
nights, so I can't even read usenet!  :-\
The answer changes if we use George and Bill's definition of
relationship. (relationship = sex) I *think* that for me, sex is
on the top of the ""want"" list, rather than on the ""need"" list.
But I'm not sure at this point.  Coming up with a more definite
answer will require extensive research.  :-)

You have a problem here.  Finding out that someone is attatched (assuming
that you haven't been having an affair with someone for a year before
finding out that they were married, something which happened to a friend
of mine, or something of that nature) should not be painful.  Mildly
disappointing, okay -- pain - no.
Pain means *big disappointment*.  You will get enough big disappointments
in your life without going out of your way to get more.  If you make a
big emotional investment in ``being able to be the SO of person X'' then
you are asking to get hurt when person X isn't interested.  You are
asking to get crushed when person X agrees to go out and then decides after
a few dates that you aren't really all that compatible.  Stop setting
yourself up so much.  You will end up believing that the world is horrid
and painful and rotten; you may end up stuck between believing that the
world owes you a {living date} and full of resentment because you aren't
getting it.  it is a real sad and painful trap.
The way out of it is to not care so much whether any particular person you
are interested in is interested in you.  There are lots of ways to
organise this to accomplish this effect.  ALready having a SO is the
easiest, but we have a bit of a bootstrapping problem here.  Asking lots
of people out is another  good solution.  Or finding something you like
more than dating.  (( zillion people will tell you that you are crazy to
like anything more than meeting attractive members of the appropriate
sex, but ask yourself this -- how happy are they?))
Good luck!

No! No!  This is a big misconception!!  One of the great media-lies is that
people in love are kept together by their deep love (read emotional
dependence) upon each other. This is simply not the case.  A sense of
humour is much more useful in keeping a relationship together.
Speaking personally, and for the ``already had several relationships''
crowd, that emotional investment is a big turn off.  When I meet
someone who is obviously infatuated with me I want to be as nasty as
possible to that person so as to stop this disease as soon as possible.
After all, if we just met, they can not have much of an idea as to what
I am really like (yea, even if they have been readin me for 5 years on
usenet!).  What they are doing is trying to stuff me into their image of
``the ideal lover'' and they are seriously in love with that ideal.
Rather than being impressing, this is a real drag.  Even if I wanted to
live for the sake of someone who has all that investment in me (which
I assuredly do not!) I couldn't.
This is really sad.  What I am looking for in new people is that they
are interesting as people.  If I get an evening of good conversation
out of any new people, then I am pleased.  if I get someone whom I can
respect I get someone that I am likely to look up again and again.
It is difficult for me to work up respect for anyone who is desparate
for a relationship.  I feel that I am getting railroaded.  What I want
is dinner, conversation and good times.  If you turn out to be a lot
of fun to be with then I am goign to want to spend more time with you.
But if you are desparate for a relationship, then you are going to be
not very much fun to be with and I am going to spend my time elsewhere.
Rememeber the adage where the girl ``plays hard to get''?  This is 
deceitful little con whereby girls (all who are presumed to be
desparate for a relationship) decieve the guys who don't want to be
clung to that they are not clingining until the poor guy gets so
intrigued that he ends up marrying someone for the difficulty involved.
This business of viewing someone as a trophy to be won turns my stomach,
but there is a point here.  This scam worked!  How come?  Because for any
reasonable (read not-love-desparate in addition to whatever else you call
reasonable) person a big display of need is a turn off.
As you go on in life, you want someone who can help share the load of
life's trials and aspirations.  You don't want someone who is so
desparate that in addition to holding your own shit together you have
to be the emotional support for them as well.  (As a temporary thing,
supporting a loved one is a great and reasonable thing.  As a day in and
day out vocation it is hell on earth.)
The only thing to be said for this approach is that it is likely to
work on very young and inexperienced women/girls.  There is something
very wrong about how women are raised.  All of them in this society
get some of a very bad brainwashing trip which says ``the function of
woman is to nurture the emotionally wounded''.  It is not the case that
most women enjoy this nurturing -- mostly they resent it like crazy but
feel that they ``have'' to do it.  if you go out projecting ``I'm
emotionally wounded -- I need a relationship'' you will probably catch
someone who will start the nuturing end of this trip without thinking.

You missed it.  I *don't* think that the world ain't so hot.  However, I
was only able to reach this enlightened position *after* deciding that
I was going to stop being so desparate for a relationship and so resentful
that I was only getting lousy ones (or none at all).  You can't help but
get resentful if you are getting rejected all the time.  But if the rejection
is in your mind (because you set yourself up) then it is also easy to fix.

I think not. Look, I'vve done this before. Everybody eats.   Whether you
go to McDonalds or eat at home or eat fancy, all you have to do is ask
a different person out to dinner every night for a month and I am sure
that you will have a much wider selection of interesting people to think
about then you have now.  I did this once.  I ended up with a lot of good
eats and 3 good friends.  it works, given that you are going to eat
anyway it is relatively cheap, and it gives you something to do while you
consider how intersting this person you have gone out with is.
By the way this ``go out with one person at a time'' is a big high school
thing that needs dropping as soon as possible.  In the old high school
days (or at least my old high school days -- maybe people have changed
since then)  you measured your status by whom you were going out with.
And *anybody* was better than *nobody*.  So if you started going out
with someone you had to ``break up'' with them before you could go out
with someone else since it was the status of the relationship that was
important, not the people.  Now that you have survived high school you can
get all teh status you want by being a damn good programmer/designer/
whatever it is that you do or by being a good dancer or any number of
things which are all better than ``who is your steady''.  So you can
start going out with people for the sake of the people rather than the
sake of a relationship.  If you know 3 neat people who happen to be
of the opposite sex, you can go out with all of them and enjoy them as
people.  I know that this is a big high-school no-no and is to some
extent perpetuated by the great American Love Myth, but in the real
world this stuff is *ok*.
If you go out with a lot of people, the only person who will think that
you are a reject is *you*.  There is no big social stigmata about this.
There are circles where it will be assumed that for some reason you
want to get laid by lots of different woemn, but even those aren't all
that common.  Most people are really not all that preoccupied with you
to notice that you are going out with a lot of people (outside of
high school, where everybody is bored, people find more interesting
things to do than keeping statistics on each other).  it will be assumed
that you want a lot of variety in your life, and a great many people
(including me) will find you intriguing.  If you know lots of people
then you are probably broad enough as a person to be very interesting
and if you keep going out with lots of different ones then you must
have high standards (or you would have clung to the first one that was
reasonable to you).  There are 2 points in your favour.  If I end up
not liking you all that much I know you must be able to take it (since
you have had a lot of practice in gracefully ending dinners at this point).
If I knew this about you I would go out to dinner in a minute.  I may be a
bad example, since I go out to dinner with almost anybody who asks me since
I am confident that I can handle any sort of situation that can arise
(because, sigh, I *have* already...) but for people with less gusto than
I do you would still be a good bet.
You will loose out on the most clinging people (who will be afraid of your
presumed independence) and on the people who are terrified that anybody
who asks them out to dinner is going to rape them, but I wouldn't call that
much of a loss.
It is fairly ironic that the people who are most deparate for love are
also the hardest to love.  If you tone down the desparation then you become
much more attractive.  This is a difficult lesson to learn.

  No, but they often only seem concerned about how the particular insecurity
in question affects *women*, which can often cause others to think that's
all they notice, instead of being concerned with how it affects *people*. 
This ""exclusive"" attitude tends to drive men and women further apart, which
as far as I understand it is *not* one of the goals of the feminist 
movement. :-) This attitude also tends to discourage men from participating
in the feminist movement, even those who may be in line with most of the
goals of that movement.

  I suspect that this is in *general* true due to differences in society's
expectations of men and women, but of course there are always individual 
variations.

  That depends on what ""MEAN it"" means. Often people willingly sacrifice their
own ""self-interest"" on a specific issue because it is more important to someone
they care about than it is to them. I really don't think this is sex-specific.
My experience is that *all* people do this to a greater or lesser extent
dependent on the individual. I have seen nothing to indicate more of a tendency
for one sex to do this than the other.

There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any

is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

This must be one of the reasons that, traditionally, women have been

See the discussions in net.social about Affirmative Action for women
and the principle of Comparitive Worth (the idea that traditional
""women's jobs"" should offer salaries equal to ""men's jobs"" of comparable
difficulty).  Should women one day find full equality in the workplace,
your problem will only get worse.

When I worked in NYC, I'd sometimes hit the singles bars with my

It bothers me that women complain about the lack of ""available men"" when,
in fact, part of the problem is their own desire to ""marry up"".  Though
I can't really blame women for marrying up if they have the opportunity
(everyone is a bit of an opportunist at least) I find it difficult to
stomach men being blamed when a woman can't find someone to ""marry up"" to.
Sure, it's not the woman's fault that she was socialized to want that,
but if it becomes a problem, why blame the men for not being good enough?
I'm not sounding off at Moira in particular, just the attitude that the
situation is tough on women but they bear no responsibility for it, that
somehow men are failing them.
I read a particularly annoying article about this a few years ago.
It went on and on about the lack of suitable men.  But in one place it did
admit that, statistically, there were more unmarried men than women up until
the age of 29 or so, even though many of the woman readers of the article
would be younger than that.  And it contained one example that particularly
upset me.  A single woman decided to have a party, inviting a number of
single men and women.  The article went on to say that ""there was only
one really interesting man there - a surgeon - and all the women arranged
themselves around him, hanging on his every word"".  Now, how did they think
the other men felt about this?  How many of the women who were complaining
about the quality of men were surgeons themselves?
I think a lot of the problem is the attitude of the women.  If a woman
can find a man to ""marry up"" to, fine - that is her priviledge.  If she
can't find a man who is her equal, she has my sympathy.  But if she
rejects men who are her equals because she is looking for someone ""better"",
she has my anger.
(As a man, it is difficult looking for someone who is your equal if the
women who *are* your equals are all looking for someone better.)
Another thought: if a woman does ""marry up"", explicitly seeking someone who
is ""above"" her in status, should she then have any reason to expect him to
see her as an ""equal""?

Quite right.  But I ALSO mentioned singles parties, sponsored by
groups like ""Young Singles of (your town)"".  I also took classes
(such as acting/improvisation) and attended various hobby clubs
(such as Toastmasters Club).  The ratio at these other activities
was not as bad as 7/1, but women WERE a distinct minority even here.
Women SHOULD be a MAJORITY at these places, if the ""manshortage theory""
were true.

'Tain't so, Frank. What's attractive to you may not ring my bells at
all. If most less-than-attractive women were 'more or less ignored,'
we'd be awash in what our parents' generation called Old Maids and
Bachelor Gentlemen. Instead, springtime rolls around each year and a
whole lot of ordinary looking or even ugly Joes marry a whole lot of
ordinary looking or even ugly Janes. Many men are strongly attracted 
to women you or I would find totally unattractive. It's instructive to 
check out a few of the kinkier personal ads in your local 
'counterculture' newspapers. Someone recently told me she'd seen an 
advertisement for women with large and prominent veins. There are even 
porno magazines that specialize in grossly obese women for certain 
men with special tastes. Chacun a son gout.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

Interesting; I find that as soon as I start fantasizing specific
details, my mind wanders and my attention [and whatever] flags, unless
there is a specific person involved in which case I fantasize whatever
makes them special (i.e. what turns me on about them).  But I tend to be
a ``realist'', and don't allow much slack for fantasies, anyway, unless
the fantasies are somehow come pretty close to reality.  I guess this
comes from the (probably false) idea of having only a limited quantity
of imagination.  Funny thing is, the *hottest* ``fantasies'' for me are
really just fond memories.  And I guess one fantasy might be that this
situation is reciprocal...

My experience in similar situations has been that talking it over with  the
others  involved  is  the best solution.  They may not be aware that others
can hear them (and may be somewhat embarrassed when they  find  out).  They
probably don't realize they're causing you a significant problem.  I expect
they don't want to regulate your sleep any more than you want  to  regulate
their sex.  Working out some mutually acceptable compromise is probably the
best bet.

To help you sleep, you might try earplugs.  Another alternative
is white noise (e.g. the hum of one of those cheap air cleaners).
I have no idea what you could do to keep from getting jealous, however.
In elementary school, whenever a kid tried chewing gum or eating in class,
the teacher would ask, ""Did you bring enough for everybody?""
I don't know if that would work in your case.	:-)

Sanford.  (It may not be readily obtainable, having been published circa 1973
by Paulist Press.)  Squarely based on the psychological work of Carl Jung and
his followers, this explored how each person has within him or her an
""invisible partner"", a feminine or masculine (respectively) side of the
personality.  He used the terms ""anima"" for the feminine side of a man, and
""animus"" for the masculine side of a woman.  A couple of interesting points
from the book (not quotes, just digests from memory):
Many people have difficulty integrating this opposite-gender piece of
themselves into their total person, despite the fact that (though they don't
realize it) both the person and the anima/us want to come together.  What 
people do instead is project their ""invisible partner"" out onto a MOTOS and
""fall in love"" with her/him -- only to be dreadfully let down when they
discover that the MOTOS is a) a human being, neither divine nor perfect,
b) not a match to their fantasies -- because not their anima/us.  In other
words, if you become terrifically infatuated with someone, it would pay to
look at yourself and/or at the image you have of the other person to see
what aspect of your ""invisible partner"" is actually trying to get out and
be accepted.
The book also discussed (in general) situations where the anima dominates the
man.  (The author did not have sufficient experience studying women to talk
much about the animus dominating the woman, but similar principles would
apply.)  The result is a sort of homogenized, feminized masculinity.  Two
manifestations of this dominance by the ""invisible partner"" are:
1) Homosexuality.  If the masculine side (which naturally desires union with
   the female) has been suppressed, the feminine (which wants the male) will
   come out.  Many of the favorable qualities of the feminine may also come
   out (e.g. I have done many theatrical productions with a man who is the
   sweetest-tempered person I know, and I'm pretty sure he's gay).
2) ""Dr. Zhivago"":  A man who is, more than most, attuned to the wants and the
   thinking of women; an ""initiate of the Great Goddess""; a man who seems
   fated to an unusual degree of self-knowledge; the ""Dr. Zhivago"" type (I
   must read that book now, to find out exactly what this means!).  This type
   of man is likely to have difficulty integrating, not the feminine, but the
   masculine side of himself into his total personality, having learned early
   to prefer the feminine and reject the masculine.  Being myself a man of
   this type, integrating the masculine side of me into my total consciousness
   has been recently one of the priority items in my own growth.
A person who has succeeded in integrating the masculine and feminine sides
(perhaps without even being very aware of the issue) can be quite a beautiful
person, e.g. a man who is definitely masculine, yet has the gentleness and
considerateness which are archetypally feminine: a man like Dave Seifert.

While a lot of what you extracted from ""The Invisible Partner"" was
quite interesting, one thing worth watching out for when making statements
like that is the erroneous stereotyping that such thinking promulgates.
Who is to say what behaviors are ""unmasculine"" (not ""right"" for a male),
""unfeminine"" (not ""right"" for a female), or for that matter, feminine
and masculine?  I think a lot of people reject certain elements of
their personalities (like sensitivity in men, or assertiveness in women)
because they subscribe to the notions that these behaviors are inappropriate
for their sex, and that's a great big pompous load of selfdamaging bullshit!
Some people even go so far as to say ""I have behaviors or feelings that are
'against' the nature of my sex [whatever that is!], therefore I *must* be
a homosexual, or a transsexual, or who knows what"".  You are what you are,
and anyone who tells you that certain parts of you exclude you from (or
automatically include you in) some particular group can go fuck themselves!

Jeff, welcome back.  Too bad you haven't changed a bit in your capacity
to infuriate me and spread misinformation about gay people.  The idea that
being gay is somehow isomorphic with the manifestation of the feminine
is an old old canard, and totally discredited.  What's more your phrasing
is downright insulting: ""...the feminine (which wants the male) will
come out ... Many of the FAVORABLE qualities of the feminine may ALSO come
out.""   Gaaaakkk, spare us.  Wonderful, too, that you have discovered
a second classification for the ""problem"" of the ""anima"" so you needn't
be stigmatized with the ""problem"" of ""homosexuality.""
Note that I'm not arguing with the issue that some men may display
qualities which are traditionally considered ""feminine"", but rather that
1.) this reflects more on the classification system than on the person.
2.) this issue is entirely orthogonal to the person's sexual preference.
Why do I bother here?  Frankly, I don't know, for I'm losing patience.
Still, this kind of misinformation, whether malicious or not, needs to be
addressed and corrected whenever it is presented in a public forum.
Jeff Sargent, more than anyone else, has been responsible for foolish
statements about gay people in the midst of his public self-analysis.
Too bad Jeff seems incapable of showing sensitivity in this issue,
for he does it again and again and again and again...  
Flame, you bet this is a flame.  Jeff just can't seem to get away
from the ""gay"" thing, generally posed in the form of a statement about
gay people (invariably perjorative) loosely tied to an issue he is
currently struggling with.  We had to put up with this for MONTHS
last year, and I'm frankly sick of it.  
Hey, I must have left my ""sweet-temper"" at home.

So, if #2 is true, why was the paragraph preceding that so flaming (by
virtue [or vice] of its implying a calumnious accusation)?  If, as you
yourself state, a heterosexual man can display archetypally feminine
qualities, why take issue with the fact that someone else has stated the

You will note that my self-analysis has been public only minimally in
recent months, partly because I have a group of actual people that I meet
with once a week for mutual support, and partly because net.singles did
not meet my needs (quite the opposite; there seemed to be a flame-throwing
contest going on for a while).  As I wrote above, I was trying to show
sensitivity; if you didn't take it that way, that's YOUR problem.

Pejorativeness is in the eye of the beholder.  This concept certainly helped
me to start integrating the archetypally masculine side of me into my life;
and I figured that a concept which was directly on target and helpful for me
stood a good chance of being generally true.  After all, I *am* a human being.
Basically I'm saying this:  As I reach a state of greater personal wholeness
and integration, the homosexual desires I have felt in the past recede more
and more, and the heterosexual desires get (sometimes inconveniently) stronger.
I would invite you to examine yourself honestly and see how well-integrated
you really are.  Start with these data:  You put me in a stereotype of myself
which is months out of date, and you reacted angrily to a statement intended
to show understanding and sensitivity.

And, I think, rightfully so.  You are not ""making an effort"" to understand,
you seem to be making an effort to fit other people into your worldview AGAIN.
(i.e., ""I had this problem, therefore these new classifications that I've read
about that I like for describing my own life, MUST apply to everyone else!"")

We might want to believe, but just asserting ""I've changed"" and showing real
evidence of it are two different things (though I've come to realize your
ability to equivalence YOUR viewpoint, no matter how tainted, to ""WHAT IS!"").

""Nyah, you don't like what I have to say, it must be because it's true, nyah!""

Because of YOUR implication that homosexuality IS ipso facto an outgrowth of
this same thing.  Fact is, I have my doubts as to why some people choose
homosexuality; I personally think a lot of gays DO feel stigmatized about being
labelled contrary to their sex (men labelled ""feminine"", women labelled
""masculine"") and choose a gay lifestyle because of that. (Of course not all
people so labelled do this.)  But that doesn't speak for those homosexuals who
simply choose to be gay because it is what they want.  And in either case, it
is nothing to look down on as ""suboptimal"" just because you don't like it.

""I'm trying to show sensitivity!  Can't you fuckin' understand that?"" said

Well...  :-?  Since gays are the group your statements are ""pejorative"" about,
I'd say they have a right to be upset.  Of course pejorativeness is in the eye
of the beholder!  In your eyes (i.e., what for you is apparently the only
""correct"" view of the world), for sure it's not upsetting.  To not recognize
how obnoxious it is to those you are referring to is the height of
insensitivity!

Translation:  As you are more pleased with your own self-image as analyzed,
your homosexual desires recede (of course they do, you hate and despise them,
what else could be expected from a positive self-image for you:  to have
such desires would invariably CAUSE a negative self-image!).  Your cart is in
front of your horse.

Intended, indeed.  But lacking in any real sensitivity.  I'm with Dyer:  you
really haven't changed.  I was just about to mail a note of congratulations for
the ""suggestion"" note you had posted, thinking you might be seeing things a
bit more clearly than the old days with the rosary-colored glasses (oh god
that was a bad one!), but no.  It was not to be.  Not stereotyping at all.
Actually witnessing little or no real change despite the changes that YOU
may subjectively perceive.

Quit looking for reasons that people are gay, quit trying to find differences
between gay people and 'good Christians', and quit referring to gay people
as suboptimal... and you won't get flammed by gay people when you make an
ass out of yourself by your stupid statements.

Let's show some sensitivity, who has got the jackhammers?  Oh, you don't

problem.

It sure is, but if many gay people find your statements about gay people

Good for the concept, and I'm glad that you feel that you are getting
integrated.  Many gays have no problem integrating their masculine sides
into their lives... or allowing their feminine sides to be a major portion
of their lives.  Oh, some gays have problems (like, ""I'm gay, I guess I have
to be a hairdresser""), but more schools like the Harvey Milk school in New
York should help.  What would be better is if people would quit trying to
make gays out as being either intrisically different from other people
or supersinners.  You seem to have given up on the latter.

Sounds like you are doing a good job of brainwashing yourself into traditional
Christian values (but better watch that lust stuff).

(Grumble ... mutter ... damn marriage counselors ... grrr)
The MMPI is probably one of the most  commonly  misunderstood  and  misused
psychological  instruments  in  existence.  This  is unfortunate as, in the
hands of  an  expert,  it  can  be  an  invaluable  tool  in  psychological
evaluation  and  therapy (I've seen an MMPI expert perform feats that would
put any fortune teller to shame just by looking at a client's profile).  It
must  be  remembered,  however,  that it's only a tool and only one of many
tools that should be used in a thorough evaluation  protocol.  The  results
must be placed in the much greater context of the person as a whole.
Becoming an MMPI expert is non-trivial.  The one I referred to above was  a
licensed  Ph.D.  psychologist  with  literally thousands of MMPI's worth of
past experience to draw on.  Unfortunately, obtaining a copy  of  the  MMPI
and  it's  scoring  sheets and instructions _is_ relatively trivial.  It is
frequently used and abused by people who, in my opinion, have  no  business
messing  with  it  at  all.  This  includes  most  marriage counselors who,
despite what _they_ think, generally lack the training to make  proper  use
of it.
Part of the problem is that the scoring procedure for the MMPI is  straight
forward.  So  much  so, in fact, that there are computer programs that will
do it and even produce tentative analyses from the scores.  These  analyses
frequently  contain  blatant  contradictions  laid  side  by  side  and are
considered worthless by most experts.  Untrained users of the  test  seldom
do much better than the computers.
Anyway, without going into further detail, the masculine/feminine scale  is
only  one  of a number of dimensions measured by the MMPI.  Any one of them
is virtually meaningless in isolation, regardless of score.  They  must  be
evaluated  in  the total context of the other scores and of the client as a
whole person.

""The human mind unconsciously resists the truth"", ah yes, what a genial
mathematician that old Freud was.   And what a wonderful weapon he provided
to the keepers of the status quo.  ""you are upset because I said women should
go back home where they belong?  well, it is because your subconscious is
reacting to the truth I just stated"", ""you are upset because I stated that
homosexuals are badly integrated individuals?  gosh, that subconscious of
yours must be having a hard time with the truth today"".
Freud said so many unproven, outrageous libellous things in his lifetime that
he HAD to cover himself with such a weapon.   You see, anybody who would get
offended by his theories, did not because they were offensive, but because
their subconscious had a hard time with the truth.  Yep, a real genius!

  I suspect this kind of relationship is more common than you might think. 
Also, I doubt if there is any clearly-defineable dividing line. I have a friend
(although I don't get to see her as much any more because we've both gotten
quite busy with other friends and other interests) with whom I have a very
close relationship. We hug, and kiss, and some of the kisses are not the
""friendly"" kind. However, we have *never* been SO's, or even close to it (or
lovers either, for that matter).  This relationship has survived through 
several SO's on each of our parts. I think one reason that you don't hear more 
about these relationships is that they can be awkward with your current SO, so
they tend to be kept more private than a real SO relationship. People fear
disapproval, both from their SO and from others.
   Also, they can be dangerous, such as when one of the parties starts thinking 
of the other as an SO they could be setting themselves up to be hurt. I had to
work through this one several years ago, but somehow the relationship survived
the strain.
  I think what defines an SO vs. a friend is agreement between the parties
involved and has nothing to do with the actual behaviors between them. Although
less common now than during the ""free love"" era, it is not unheard of for
someone to have an SO *and* one or more other lovers. Thus, it isn't as simple
as sexual relations defining an SOship either. I'd say that if you *both* view
the relationship as an SOship, then that's what it is, but if *either* party
does not see it this way, then the *mutual* commitment which defines an
SOship is not there.

How do you 'know' that they were ""having thoughts of a sexual nature""?

Oh, so I should have sex with anyone I hug?  Thank you very much,
but I'll pass on that one.  I hug lots of people that I wouldn't
have sex with, including other males, relatives, married women,
children...
It is quite possible to be close to someone, give them hugs, kisses,
and cuddles, and *not* have sex with them, and to be quite happy
with the situation.  You can even sleep with them and not have sex
with them.
Too many people think the way you do.  It doesn't lead to more sex,
it leads to less hugging.  :-(  I wish that more people thought the way
Chris does.  Sex isn't the be-all and end-all that the popular media
make it out to be.  Wonderful, yes, but there *are* other worthwhile
things in life.  Affection, caring, trust, these are what really count.
hugs to all,

By now I'm sure Rion has been told that SO = Significant Other  more  times
than  enough.  The  underlying  question  of much of the current discussion
seems to  center  on  what  _is_  a  Significant  Other.  The  most  common
definitions implicitly put forth seem to define SO as someone with whom one
is both  romanticaly  and  sexually  inolved.  I  would  like  to  offer  a
different perspective.
From  a  psychological  view  SO  is  a  technical  term  with  a  specific
definition.  It  refers  to  _anyone_  who  has  an  immediate, significant
influence  on  a  person's  life.   Examples  include   parents,   friends,
relatives,  siblings, teachers, etc., etc.  Note that the relationship need
not include any romantic or sexual aspects.  Anyone the person cares  about
_for any reason_ is an SO.
From the above perspective the question of where friendship ends and SOship
begins  is  meaningless.  A  friend  _is_  an  SO, by definition.  The real
question then  becomes  one  of  how  much  romantic/sexual  involvement  a
friendship  can  stand or whether it's possible to be friends with a sexual
partner.  All of these conditions are subcategories of SOship.

BINGO!!  Thats the exact problem that I  have  right  now.  I  have  a
friend  who  moved  in  with  me three months ago.  We have known each
other for many years and have always  been  touching.  Its  also  been
just  short  of  sex.  This  seems to be just fine for her, but I have
gotten rather attached to her and find that I do have sexual  feelings
for her.
I know that we have some kind of committment,  because  we  have  been
talking  about  moving  lately  and she tells me that she'll move just
about anywhere in the world with me.
Sometimes I feel like she would be receptive and sometimes I feel like
she wouldn't, but I know that if I tried to make a sexual relationship
out of what we have I could ruin a GREAT friendship.
So, yeah, we touch and have back and foot rub sessions and hug and  do
lots  of  things  together,  but I've gotten to the point where I want
more and right now I feel frusterated.

If you're really into serious hugging, you might consider buying a hugging
suit.  Nike and Adidas manufacture some good ones.  The chief purpose is
to prevent friction burns.  The nylon suits are cheaper and more durable,

Psychology Today's explaination was that people choose their partners
to be AS GOOD LOOKING AS POSSIBLE.  It is only to avoid pointless
frustration, disappointment and rejection that they settle for the
best they can get, i.e. someone whose looks are comparable.

You were bothered by the way a salesman tends to emphasize the advantages
of his product, while ignoring the disadvantages and weaknesses.  Similarly,
some people are good at putting on a good front, making themselves seem better
than they really are.  I believe you expressed annoyance at the success
of this (dishonest?) tactic.
I have no sympathy for the guy who just plain _lies_ about his accomplishments.
But I believe you should try to emphasize your most attractive qualities
and distract attention from your faults as much as possible.  These will
come out soon enough anyway.  But why expose them to someone before
that person has first had a chance to appreciate your good points?
To connect this to the evil-eye business -- The person afraid of the evil
eye will dwell his disatisfactions.  He is overly modest, feeling that
pride not only goeth before a fall, but actually causeth the fall.
Focusing so much attention on his faults, such a person begins to create
a self-image based on them.  This makes it doubly difficult to improve,
since any new behavior will be seen as phony and unnatural.
The Positive-Thinker, on the other hand, focuses his attention upon what is
good (or improving) about himself, not because he is completely satisfied
with what he sees, but because a positive self-image is necessary for proper
growth.
In other words, if you tell yourself that you are stupid, you will lose
confidence in yourself, and the resulting anxiety will cause you to make
stupid mistakes, thus confirming your self-image.  If you tell yourself
that you are intelligent, you will not be afraid to use your mind.
The result is that, effectively, you will conduct your life in a more
intelligent fashion.  Similarly, if you tell yourself that you're a really
sexy guy (in your own way), you will begin to behave in a manner consistent
with your self-image.  The result is that you WILL become sexier.
So, when a person you know well seems to be promoting himself in a biased
way, he is not necessarily dishonest.  He may be merely focusing on
the bright side.  And let's face it.  A person who often puts himself down
in public is likely to do the same thing to his spouse, children,
friends or employer, once he begins to strongly identify with them.
Who wants to have someone like that around?

Honesty is not the point.  A woman KNOWS she is only mortal.
If you come on like you're in love and you hardly even know her,
well, what is she to think of you?  Isn't this the essence of

In her book, _The_Truth_About_What_Women_Want_in_Men_, Susan Eno explains
why some women pair up with tough, superficial, uncaring men.
She says that women really want a man who is both --
	1) tough, confident, and competitive, so he can protect her
		from the world,
and
	2) sensitive, vulnerable and caring so she can feel loved.
It is difficult to find men capable of relating to people in BOTH modes.
So, some women compromise and choose a man who is only 1), while others
settle for a man who is only 2).  But, what women really want is someone
who can go either way, depending upon what is appropriate to the situation.
I, myself, am a 2), trying to tack on some 1) characteristics.
I was discussing women a couple of weeks ago with a friend of mine.
This guy is a ""Big Man On Campus"".  He'll be president of the senior class
this fall.  He's active in student government and the fraternity system.
He complained that, while he knows hundreds of women, and dates frequently,
he still feels lonely.  He doesn't know how to switch modes from being
the jolly ""master of ceremonies"" type, so his relationships, though pleasant,
lack intimacy.  Because of his religious beliefs, casual sex is out of
the question.
I responded told him that I have the reverse problem, namely, how
do I get women to notice me in the first place?  Once I know the
woman cares for me a little, I can take it from there.
We agreed that, together, the two of us would make one hell of a guy!

There are no absolute standards here, it depends on what culture
or subculture you are in.  For instance, in France, platonic friends
do all of the above.  And in some subcultures of Californica,
casual friends have sex, as well.
The term ""SO"" is usually used by monogamous or nearly monogamous people.
Assuming you fit that category, simply list your behaviors according to
increasing intimacy.  As you go down the list, you'll eventually reach
behaviors that you do not do with most of your friends.  When you get
to one that you rarely do with more than one person in any given week,
well that's where to draw the line.

salient developments in the understanding of AIDS.  Well, almost the
entire June 21 issue of JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Assoc.)
is devoted to AIDS.  It would be too much to summarize all the articles
(and they do cover almost all issues collectively), so I am just posting
an edited version of one of the two editorials.
   I am also adding net.singles to the distribution for this time round

				-Craig Werner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Two columns on 'The Dilemma of Serological Testing']
:
[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]
:
  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The word ""girl"" has at least two meanings.  It can refer to any
prepubescent female.  Also, it is often used to describe any
adult female who is still young enough to be sexually attractive.
In the second context, the word ""girl"" is used to avoid the negative
connotations often associated with the word ""woman"" (one such negative
connotation is a middle-age spread--check out who shops the ""women's
sizes"" at Sears).
Feminists insist on restricting the word ""girl"" to the first meaning.
I recommend that we humor them when posting to this network,
to avoid unnecessary flames.

When meeting a woman without benefit of a third person's introduction,
you are at a disadvantage.  The woman may feel cheap if she allows
herself to be ""picked up"".  She may wonder if you are secretly a
homocidal rapist.  Having just met you, she may not be sure whether
she is even attracted to you.  If she does agree to go out with you,
will she have to submit to sexual harassment?
For these reasons, always suggest a first date that is SAFE.
Don't ask her for dinner Saturday night.  Ask her out for Monday lunch.
Or a picnic in a crowded park.  Choose a casual date that provides
NO OPPORTUNITIES for you to make unwelcome sexual advances.
If the date you propose is ""safe"", the woman will be more likely
to take a chance on you.  The ""safe"" date allows her to build
her trust in you gradually.
What's important in to take things one step at a time.

It does seem unfair that an adult male can be imprisioned
for having sex with a 17 year-old, if she is indeed a woman,
and not a girl.
One traditional viewpoint is that a girl becomes a woman
when she has sex for the first time.

First of all, nobody's seen Jackie Onassis lately, without her sunglasses.
As for Gloria Steinem, I might call her a girl, if only to annoy her.
Most of the rest are movie actresses.  Haven't you heard of special effects?

Back then, these places were opportunities which most people
wouldn't touch.  Having a bit more disposable income than a
typical family (no kids, you see) and a bit more spare time,
they worked to shape their environments into their image of
the good life.
Today's young, professional straight couples actually have a lot in common
with gay couples: they are putting off having families, have become
more sophisticated in their tastes, and have the money to indulge them.
There's not much difference there, except sexual preference!  Some
wags, probably before the coinage of the Y-word, have called them
""straight gays.""  Other people see the ""yuppie"" phenomenon as just
another example of the great morass of straights rushing in to

Now that you ask, I can't figure out what he's saying either.  But when

I find it difficult to believe the implication of this: that the vast
majority of men do not want to take any responsibility for birth control.
I take this responsibility seriously, and the few men that I've talked
to about it also do.
Perhaps the statistics also measure the sort of men that these women chose?
If they are so disappointed in men that don't express concern about birth
control, then why are they having sex with them?  Is there some sort of
correlation between the fact that these men are not interested in birth
control and the fact that these women were attracted to them?
Also, were the men not discussing birth control because they didn't care,
or because they were uncomfortable discussing it and got the impression that
the woman was too?  Communication is the responsibility of both parties.
Essentially, my experience contradict's Judy's.  I'm curious as to why.

OK, so we agree on one thing: it's unromantic.  However it's quite
necessary.  What happens if she forgets?  Is it really so horrible
to ask ""What about birth control?"" and get an ""All taken care of, I
use the <foo> method.""  Wouldn't you rather hear an ""Opps, I forgot,
hang on a minute"" than get a ""We have a little problem"" call a
couple months down the road?
A little consideration goes a long way.

If I could choose only one, I'd choose hugs over sex, too.  Sex without
hugs is almost unthinkable!  But if I was assured of having the hugs
either way, I think I'd give the same answer as almost any red-blooded...

I might agree with your explanation if it wasn't for the fact that the size
of breasts of non-lactating women is actually uncorrelated to their potential
for feeding babies.  There are women with large breasts who have very little
milk and women with minuscule breasts who can feed triplets and still give milk
away to other babies.

	I think that perhaps the women you know are less willing
to *talk* about what they want from a man (including the size of his
penis, etc.).  Unfortunately, our society conditioned women to look
upon sex as undesirable, a necessary evil, and that they should
not like it.  So, if they aren't supposed to like it, then they
aren't going to discuss what they *do* like.
	Fortunately, things are different today.  However, that
centuries-old attitude of sex being evil and nasty has left some
bad after-tastes (like Tab); this inability to communication 
likes and dislikes about sex is one of them.
	BTW, I hope the ""That's Baloney!!"" was meant as a pun.. :-)

Admittedly I haven't personal experience to back this up, but have you
considered *residing* together, as distinct from the usual sense of
""living together""?  It occurs to me that if you and your SO could
successfully deal with the stresses of sharing a residence, for an
extended period, *without* using sex to paper over disagreements, then
your friendship would be so solid that you would greatly increase your
chances of a successful marriage, should you decide to exercise that option.
Another way to look at it is: one thing at a time.  Work out the balances
of plain vanilla daily life first; when they are running reasonably
swimmingly, *then* start working on the adjustments of sex.  Don't try
to do everything at once.
The obvious difficulties in this arise from this not being the best of all
possible worlds: a) the temptation to go ahead with sex would be there, and
would probably be very strong; b) even if you didn't give in to that
temptation, you'd have a tough time convincing outsiders of your celibacy
(particularly parents, I suppose).  But the idea still seems to me to have
some wisdom in it.  Perhaps you could try it, and let the net know how it
works out?

Of course in the ideal world we are all friends before we become
intimate.  In practice, as someone (perhaps on the net) has said ""First
you find out if the hardware is compatible, *then* you worry about the
software...""
Realistically, couples who cohabit for more than purely economic
reasons are more than likely to have slept together, probably for some
time.  Perhaps someone with more self-discipline than I could deal with
the loss of sexual contact while negotiating ""the stresses of living
together."" In my case, it would have induced enough additional stress
to have guaranteed a break-up.
From my own experience, sex is hardly used to ""paper over"" disagreements.
The influence is usually in the other direction.  One tries to resolve
(in some sense) disagreements before going into the bedroom so that they
don't follow you in.  Sex as a tool of placation is a definite bummer
for everyone involved.
Too, the stresses of living together don't ever go away (sorry to pop
your balloon.)  No matter how long-term the relationship, there are
always the proverbial hairs in the sink or toothpaste squeezed from the
wrong end of the tube and a million other things that make you
momentarily wish you were living with *anyone* but your partner.  You
learn to adapt, but most of all you learn to care.  The world won't end
if you move away from the way you've always done things just a bit to
leave some space for someone you love.
Finally, living together ain't a whole lot different than being
married.  It hurts just as much when it dissolves (I speak from
experience) even when relatively ""amicable.""  The major difference is
that when you've only been cohabiting the lawyers and the courts don't
have to get involved.  When you go through a divorce, the lawyers and
the courts are the least of your problems.
Advice?  Hardly any.  Living together isn't the romantic ideal folks
cook it up to be, but then neither is marriage.  (Sound of more
balloons popping?) You make your relationships the best way you know
how, which never seems as good as it could be.  Me?  I wouldn't trade
it for anything

I'm not so sure I agree with your first sentence.  From my minimal (but
nonzero) experience (the net registers shock), I have come to the conclusion
that chastity is really a good thing.  If your experience doesn't teach that,
O.K.; things like this really have to be either discovered or accepted on
faith, and despite all my net.religion postings, I'm really a sufficiently
obstinate sort that I usually have to learn things by discovery....
This doesn't say chastity is an *easy* thing, and that I sometimes don't get
envious of those who allow themselves easier access to sex; but that does not
mean that contemning those who are thus active is part of my credo.
> When you stop thinking of sex as something to be avoided, and

> problem you have made it to be...
Sex, in and of itself, is neither ""to be avoided"" nor ""inherently evil"";
after God created man and woman with physical bodies and sexual desire, He
saw that His creation was ""very good"".  Sex out of the context of commitment,
however, is another question.  Clearly you and your SO have some degree of
commitment; this gray area is one I cannot address from experience; but I do
still question whether sex outside a *lifetime* commitment is a good thing.

Moi?  Disrespect the social sciences?  On what do you base this?
As to my being an amateur psychologist, I doubt that many people have
studied their most intimately available psychological subject (themselves)
nearly so much as I have studied myself (a mildly abnormal subject and not
fond of that, so I've been getting repairs made).  I haven't a lot of
training, but I have a fair amount of experience.

I suspect that a lot of parents have the belief that you mentioned in the

I don't know about you, but I'd have a bit of trouble having sex so often
that I had no oppertunity to get to know my partner better.  Sex has become
part of the getting-to-know process, not a replacement for it.  In fact,
after sex is often the best time to discuss those more intimate emotional
matters...  I suspect that this psychologist has some other reason for
her views.

Say whaaaa?  Past years in many cultures, notably Victorian, were times of

...such as supporting her own beliefs.  Ed is right.  ALWAYS suspect
sociologists, psychologists, etc.  With annoying frequency, one finds that
they tend to fix on an idea and set out to prove it rather than fixing on a
question and setting out to answer it.  (They're not all fools or
charlatans; it's just a problem endemic to studying people.)

I suspect that many a (seemingly?) insensitive man may have a dream that some
""perfect"" woman is going to graciously, with incredible humility, take him as
SO and thereby, shall we say, forgive him his sins and redeem him; that by
submitting her (imagined) purity and perfection to the possible depredations
of his impurity and imperfection, she would somehow relieve him of the gnawing
pain that comes from knowing that no matter how much one grows as a person,
one is never perfect; one always has sins.  In other words, men are looking
for a woman to play the role of Christ in a visible, palpable manner.  It is
probably for this reason that a man takes it as such a special honor to be
the first man to have sex with a particular woman -- that she cares so much
for him that she sacrifices even her virginity for him -- a blood sacrifice,
yet!  Perhaps somehow the verse, ""Without shedding of blood there is no
remission [of sins]"" is floating around in their subconsciousnesses.
A darker possibility here is that a man may, at bottom, really have it in for
women -- really, actually, hate them, or at least bear a grudge against that
side of the human species.  Thus, if his feelings of attraction to women, or
to a particular woman, are carefully analyzed, he may actually be considering
her to be pure and perfect with an eye to how good it would feel (emotionally
as well as physically) to defile all that sweet purity.  Note that this

on holidays anyway, I'll take the time to followup.
	From: aeq@pucc-h (Jeff Sargent)
	I suspect that many a (seemingly?) insensitive man may have a
	dream that some ""perfect"" woman is going to graciously, with
	incredible humility, take him as SO and thereby, shall we say,
	forgive him his sins and redeem him; that by submitting her
	(imagined) purity and perfection to the possible depredations
	of his impurity and imperfection, she would somehow relieve him
	of the gnawing pain that comes from knowing that no matter how
	much one grows as a person, one is never perfect; one always
	has sins.  In other words, men are looking for a woman to play
	the role of Christ in a visible, palpable manner.
I, personally, am not looking for someone to redeem my sins, either Christ
or a woman.  I have my own standards of right and wrong, but they seem
considerably easier to live within than the Christian ones (judging by the
difficulty Christians seem to have) and so I don't ""sin"", by my standards,
very often.  And when I do, I seem to be able to forgive myself eventually.
And I see very little sign of longing for redemption among my closer friends,
either.
	It is probably for this reason that a man takes it as such a
	special honor to be the first man to have sex with a particular
	woman -- that she cares so much for him that she sacrifices
	even her virginity for him -- a blood sacrifice, yet!
I don't consider virginity to be particularly precious.  And the loss of
virginity does not need to involve the shedding of blood!  What are you
going to do, Jeff, if you have sex with a virgin and she doesn't bleed?
Are you going to think she was lying about her virginity, or will you
believe her but feel less honoured because she didn't bleed?  And what
happens if you don't quite feel fully redeemed afterwards - do you have
to go out and find another virgin?  (I'm deliberately being facetious
here - I'm trying to illustrate why I think treating virginity as
a precious commodity is silly.)
	A darker possibility here is that a man may, at bottom, really
	have it in for women -- really, actually, hate them, or at
	least bear a grudge against that side of the human species.
	Thus, if his feelings of attraction to women, or to a
	particular woman, are carefully analyzed, he may actually be
	considering her to be pure and perfect with an eye to how good
	it would feel (emotionally as well as physically) to defile all
	that sweet purity.  Note that this entails, again, his
	considering himself as wondrously impure, so that he can be the
	defiling agent ...
You seem to be saying, basically, that the man is attracted to the woman
because he wants to hurt her.  Probably some men are, but I don't think
this is predominant in the attitudes of very many men.  And for this to
work, you still have to see the woman as ""perfect"" and thus subject to
being ""defiled"".  A woman is a human being, not a church!
	But it is astonishing what you find out when you ""show God your
	dirty pictures"", as one pastor friend of mine put it -- i.e. be
	appallingly honest about your sexual fantasies; Playboy can
	thus sometimes serve as a focusing device.
Honesty about yourself to yourself is usually a good thing....
	Anyway, returning to the theme of my earlier paragraphs, what
	would seem to be necessary for marriage or SO-ship is that a
	man become sufficiently accepting of his own and everyone
	else's sins/imperfections that he can be intimate with a woman
	who is just as sinful/imperfect as he is, and love her
	nevertheless.
	My only question is:  how on earth can anyone pull this off?
My reply is: It is possible to accept oneself.  And if you can accept
yourself, you probably can accept others too on the same terms.
And I really don't like your use of ""nevertheless"" - you seem to be
implying that love is associated with perfection, and that it may
require effort to learn to love someone even if they aren't perfect.
Rubbish.  Can't you love someone's faults as well as their good
features?  Wait, I'll make a yet stronger statement:  If you see
someone as perfect, you can worship them but you cannot really love
them at all.  It is only the real, imperfect people that you can love,
not the pedestalized perfect ones.
I would say that you, Jeff, need to learn to accept yourself for
yourself, rather than looking for a woman to accept you and thus make
everything alright.  And yes, I know it's difficult.  (I have a
difficult time seeing myself as lovable and desirable during the times
when there is no one that visibly sees me in that way.)  But looking
for a woman whose presence will change your life is, I think, the wrong
approach.

Actually, you're right...usually.  Every once in a while, God can even use
Playboy to zap one with an insight into a twist in one's own feelings about
relationships, sexuality, or whatever.
I could comment that you don't need Playboy, since you have access to a woman
who is beautiful to you (I have no idea of her physical appearance, but she's
certainly beautiful to you) at any time you reasonably desire -- and not just
to a view of her, but to her reality.  Of course, in order for you to not need
or want to examine Playboy, this would also imply that you are strong enough
to handle having a real woman in your life, who may not always behave quite the
way you would most want, and who has some degree of control over you -- as
distinct from fantasies (with or without the aid of photos), which you control
entirely.  More power to you!  I'm not sure I'm at that point; the thought of
having an SO, now that I examine it more closely, is frightening.

Like it or not, there are some worthwhile things in Playboy (or at
least there used to be:-).  There's also some trash.  PARTS of the magazine
are degrading to women.  Actually, Playboy as I recall it significantly
overlaps Bon Appetit, Road and Track, maybe a bit of the New Yorker.  Best
sort out what's there...but that's not my main point...

I find it hard to believe that Greg (>) is willing to take shots at Playboy
as being degrading to women, without using a tactical nuke on this (>>=Jeff)
opinion.  If believing that having ""access to a woman...at any time you

First off, could you tell me just what need it is that is satisfied by both
a wife and Playboy magazine?  (Sounds like a koan for 20-th century
America, doesn't it?:-)  There seems to be some confusion in this whole
mess over Playboy--some think it incites the passions; some think it is a
surrogate satisfier.
If Christianity vs hormones is a problem, I suggest that you look again to
your religion.  It better have an answer for you, because the hormones are
there just as they should be, doing what they're supposed to do.  I'll give
you one clue:  ""Ignore them"" ain't a useful answer.

        Laziness and/or unintendended ignorance, I guess; it's
much easier to deal with a group as a group than to separately
acknowledge the various sub-groups within the group.  It would be
easy (to use an analogy) to say that 'Black people do this' in
discussing certain behaviors that are practiced almost
exclusively by Black males. 
        Of course, this is not meant to condone the behavior you
describe in any way.  I am aware that the proportion of lesbian
AIDS victims to male homosexual AIDS victims is very low. 
        However, if perhaps the lesbian community were to become
more visible (both to male homosexuals and to heterosexuals),
then this tendency to lump the lesbian community in with the male
homosexual community would decrease.

It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men and
women"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc.  The
linguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words as
pseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language.
Yet one can see the results of this.  Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she""
(unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean just
what the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptions
abound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners.
Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, or
else the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right?
(""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."")  This is why
many people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER,
police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid having
people assume that they refer to males.  Insisting that ""a policeman can
be a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (even
subconsciously) to mean policeMAN.  Notice that even a word like homosexual
(which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) gets
interpreted to mean ""male homosexual"".  (Thus it may not be just in
particular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions that
if no gender is specified, we're talking about males.)
Also, of course, there are other factors.  (Like assuming that the words
homosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive.  I seem to remember that a
lot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ...""
specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.)  But if you think about
it, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say a
word that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"".

and women that I know) gays have a general idea of how straights think
because they are raised as straights.  Unfortunately, we aren't blessed
with a society whose parents might consider that their children might
not be heterosexual.  From my experience, children on this planet tend
to be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of their
own.  Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, it
makes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straights
think.
	As for straights thinking of men only when considering
homosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right.  Ask
any ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like.  The
odds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someone
who wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be a
transvestite.  Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pride
celebrations, few women are seen.  Perhaps if lesbians were more
visible to the outside world, they might become part of the stereotype
(if, indeed, this is desirable).

teachers?  I know several gay teachers, and none of them would have
anything to do with their students sexually.  Besides which, I am
totally certain that hetrosexual teachers approach their students
(of the opposite sex) for sexual favours much more often than gay
teachers approach their students (of the same sex).  (If nothing else,
the numbers should work out that way.  After all, only 6-10% of the
population is gay, one may assume that the teaching profession has
no greater incidence of homosexualallity than the basic population,
and the vast majority of gay people are not into children... just like
the straight community.)  Anyway, I will agree that that one teacher
may not have been up to the standards of the teaching profession,
and should have been removed as a teacher; not because he/she was gay,
but because he/she was seducing his/her students from a power position.
Also, what gives you the idea that the young men that your single
teacher could make his students gay?  It is far more likely that
those he was successful in approaching were, in fact, gay already,
since it is claimed that sexuality (affectational prefferance) is
fixed by the time a child is 2 or 3 years old.  It is likely that
such young gentlemen (or women) were suffering from the effects
of the suppression of their of their sexuality, due to the fact of
the intense oppression gay people have suffered and are suffering
still.  After all when ""everyone"" tells you that being gay is
wrong/sinfull/evil, and you still feel these things, it tends to
mess up ones mind.
Finally, what life of anguish?  Most of the gay persons that I
know (and there are a great number of them), are normal people
with normal lives.  My life (which is the only one that I should
really comment on, although many of my friends would, I am sure,
agree with me) is very much normal.  I work, play, and sleep,
just as you do.  I have my joys and sorrows, just as you do.
Basically, my life is as happy as that of most anybody you ever
met or ever will.  My only major concern is that everyone be

If you've got a teacher teaching sexual mores to gradeschool kids, then
yes, work to get rid of the teacher.  Homosexuality doesn't have anything
to do with it.  That seems to be the point you've missed, both in the
original and in your followup.  The issue is not related to the private
life of the teacher.  That isn't any of your damn business.  If the teacher
is teaching (or otherwise promoting in the classroom) sensitive topics not
relevant to what is supposed to be taught, the teacher is wrong.  PLEASE
NOTE that I did not say ""sensitive viewpoints"" - I said ""sensitive topics""
and I mean ""regardless of what view is expressed on those topics...""

This statement is a good one - the ""neutrality"" is the main point.  It's
the same as the point I was tryin to make in the preceding paragraph.
Again - if you've got a teacher who is teaching sexual attitudes in a
gradeschool, you've got a valid complaint - but homosexuality is a red
herring.

for *you* (judging from your articles in this group) does not mean it will
work for everyone. I don't want to start a discussion here that really belongs
in net.religion, but let's face it: in order for religion to be of some help
to you, you have to be able to believe many very important things for which 
there is absolutely no hard scientific evidence (that I can see), solely on
the word of other human beings.  Lots of people with analytical minds (like me) 
have a great deal of trouble with this. (If you want to continue this argument
with me, let's do it by private mail, since this really doesn't belong here. 
However, I think I'm justified posting this one article since you have stated 
your views here several times.)
  I don't know about you, but when I get lonely, one thing that makes me get
""desperate"" is just plain old biology. I have a sex drive (surprise!), and when
it goes for long periods without satisfaction, I become unhappy both physically
and emotionally, just as I would if deprived of food or sleep.  Human beings
also have emotional drives (in this case, for love and affection), which are
less well understood, but nevertheless real. I submit that it is these
physical and emotional drives that cause people to become ""desperate"". The
Christians are really into guilt trips, it seems to me. Everyone is bad,
we are all sinners. I just don't believe that, and I believe it is a *very*
destructive way to think. Guilt is *not* the only motivation, nor is it
even the primary one, at least for most of the people I know. I think love
and hate are *far* more powerful, and biology (hunger, sex drive, etc.)
more powerful still. I believe it is those who have strong feelings of guilt
about something that turn to Christianity (and other religions; no need
to pick exclusively on the Christians) because it promises the ultimate
relief from guilt. I don't really intend to put down Christianity here;
if it makes *you* feel better to believe it, great. Just try to remember
that not everyone feels as guilty as you do or looks at the world the same
as you.

I know that it is a personal thing, but for me the `desperation' is
not so much a biological (or `hormonal') need as it is just a desire
to give and receive affection.  If worst comes to worse, I can take
care of the sexual part myself.  And I can give myself a certain
amount of affection.  But there just isn't a substitute for sharing
a hug, a touch, or an admiring glance, with someone I care about.
Were I to choose between this without sex, or a series of one-night
stands, I know what my choice would be...

Sigh....  I never expected to have so many responses to one sentence.  I will
say briefly that there is considerable archaeological evidence; that the word
of human beings is the way one gets interested in God, but when you actually
come to know God, you have something (Someone) more than that as a foundation
for your belief, Someone with whom you have a dynamic relationship, not just a
bunch of words; and that I probably have just as analytical a mind as you do.
Greg also pointed out that people have physical sex drives and emotional needs
for closeness.	I fully agree.	Note that my article was not saying that guilt
was the ONLY motive a given person would have for desperation (it wasn't in my
case), nor that all desperate people must necessarily feel guilty about
something (I don't know all desperate people, so I can't know that); I was
merely pointing out the root of some of my feelings in the hope that it would
encourage others to look at themselves, see if their feelings had similar
roots, and deal with them if so.
Greg also blamed my Christianity for my guilt trip.  I admit that many people
(including Christians) view Christianity as being a system of rules.  Of
course it isn't; the name of the game is not avoidance of sin, but freedom
from sin.  Still, even though I'm not in the rigid fundamentalist tradition,
I still sometimes tend to feel that I ought to be punished for my sins and
failures -- but I don't feel that way so much because of my Christianity
(though I do have trouble reconciling God's justice, which I feel I deserve,
with His mercy, which I crave), but because I'm a terrible perfectionist and
have been since long before I knew anything about Christianity.
(Why is the above paragraph in here?  Because I see nothing wrong with using
this group at least partly for us all to just get to know each other, rather
than spending all our time addressing specific questions.)
Also, I would again pose the question (to all readers, not just to Greg):
Why are you so desperate?  There are probably plenty of nice MOTOS's
available.  Analyze yourself.  Be honest (brutally honest at times) with
yourself.  Find out what feelings (or actually, what erroneous beliefs about
yourself) are keeping you from going out and making friends with those
MOTOS's.  Decide to stop believing those erroneous beliefs; recognize them
for the destructive lies that they are, and change your mind.  The cause for
your desperation is not that your body and emotions have not received what
they desire.  The ultimate cause is that you have (for whatever reason) not
believed it possible for them to receive what they desire.
Another example of this, which I have just realized, faced, and dealt with,
and which I also offer in the hope that it might help some other readers:
I felt that I was not really a man.  Oh, of course I have the appropriate
physical characteristics; but I felt that I wasn't really a man INSIDE.  I camefrom a background not calculated to make one grow up feeling strongly male: my
parents divorced when I was 8; and my mother, who got custody of me, was (or
at least I perceived her as) domineering.  I've just been reading a book
(""Eros Defiled"", by John White) in which it is mentioned that those who grow
up in such backgrounds may become what is known as ""pseudohomosexuals"" --
i.e. men who may have some characteristics of homosexuals and/or lack some of
the characteristics of normal heterosexuals, who are more likely to have
homosexual feelings and be vulnerable to homosexual temptation than most
males, but who are not practicing homosexuals.	I certainly ended up this way;
I've never had a homosexual experience, but I've sometimes wanted males all
too strongly.  Anyway, the neat turnaround in my case was that my desire for a
really good woman as friend and lover -- the desire around which all my
frustration had been built -- came to my aid!  I realized that there is one
young woman I know whom I have been attracted to and cared about for some
months, not because she is a generic woman (I know, there's no such thing)
who could heal my ""disease"" and cure my problems, but because she is a good
companion, being an intelligent, sensitive, talented, and beautiful woman.
(And to top it off, I'm not sure if she believes that she's attractive!  So I
have some compassion for her too.)  In other words, realizing that I had a
desire which was a normal male desire, not based on sickness and pain, enabled
me to know that yes, I too am a real man!  [Then why do I like quiche? :-)]
BTW, the young lady involved has some inkling of how I feel; perhaps when we
meet for dinner and conversation next week [SURPRISE! Jeff got a date! :-)]
I will have an opportunity to progress....


Oh my god!  nobody has taken that one up yet!  Jeff Please!! I'd like to
suggest that you really apply the counsels you give us to yourself, especially
the ones about not accepting those erroneous beliefs and realising how dangerous
they are.  Why in the world do you have to equate homosexual feelings with
""not being a man""?  (what is a ""man"" anyway?) why are your desires for women
""normal"" and your desires for men ""based on sickness and pain""?  Has your God
really told you that some of those of those desires are bad and the others good?
Are you sure that you haven't been fooled by people rather than God into
believing such things?  people have said many things in the name of God to
suit their own little purposes and not necessarily for the good of others.  As
you seem to be in very close contact with your God, you should really make sure
that he REALLY disproves of those homosexual feelings you have before you
reject them as ""sick"" and throw yourself at women instead because you think it
is the ""right"" thing to do (I am wildly paraphrasing you here, and could be
completely wrong in my interpretation of your words).  If your God is a god of
Love as you say he is, he might accept many different types of Love, and if he
doesn't why doesn't he?  you should also ask him that. 
Your words make it sound as though you are interested in relationships with
women only so that they can ""save"" you from your desires for men.  If that is
so, that doesn't sound very good for the woman you will have a relationship with
Shouldn't she deserve to be loved for who she is rather than because she is
""saving"" you from other people you love?  And if you love other people and they
also love you, wouldn't you all be more happy just loving each other rather
than trying to pretend you don't?  This sounds like I am pushing you to lead a
homosexual life; yes and no, I think you should just make sure that you are
not interested in heterosexual relationships just to avoid homosexual relation-
ships, and if you are, then maybe reconsider your choice.  I am not alone in
thinking that it is possible to be both a Christian and homosexual (I can look
up some references for you if you are interested).
Go in peace.

I never made such an equation.	I indicated that the homosexual feelings were
a CONSEQUENCE of feeling ""not really a man"".  What is a ""man""?	Come on, this
is abnormal psych we're talking; it doesn't have to make sense! :-)
Seriously, I'm not 100% sure; but I think part of the problem is that, having
been born in 1955, I was too much imbued with the idea that one had to be
macho in order to be male.  I was a whiz kid, 2 years ahead of my ""normal""
grade in school, still beating most of the other kids academically (and the
same height as most of my classmates, or things would have been worse), but
still 2 years behind them in development of strength and coordination.	Thus I
was no athlete -- and the mid-60's were still a relatively unenlightened era,
when society ""required"" males to be athletic.  Also, for most of my life, I
had no full-time male role model (remember, my parents divorced when I was 8).
Thus I had no one from whom to learn how a man acts around other people (of
either sex.
I think these were the two main reasons why I didn't feel myself to be a
man.  The fact that the first one is based on a false premise did not prevent
me from believing it; remember that the macho ideal thoroughly imbued the
society of that era (including the other boys in school, who lost no chance to
put me down), and so this belief in my own unmanliness was probably fixed by
the time I was 10 -- well before my critical faculties had reached any
significant level of maturity.
> why are your desires for women
> ""normal"" and your desires for men ""based on sickness and pain""?
I wasn't spouting doctrine.  I was giving experiential evidence; i.e. the past
times when I have been really bummed out have generally been the times when my
homosexual desires have been strongest.  When I was feeling reasonably good
about myself and the world, my homosexual desires submerged; in fact,
especially in the last year or two, I actually did date women a few times
(i.e. my rendezvous earlier this evening was not the first in a century).
Thus it's not a question of ""why"" heterosexuality is normal, and homosexuality
not; based on my experience (and on some case histories I've read), they just
ARE that way.

Let us put it this way:  Based solely on my ""close contact"", I consider it
certain that He much prefers heterosexuality to homosexuality.	(I won't
even mention the many Biblical utterances against homosexuality.)  I don't go
for women because I think it's ""right"".  I do it because that's what I really
want to do; women are great people, with (in general) certain qualities of
warmth and tenderness which I just can't get even from my closest male
friends -- and I'm not talking about sex, I'm talking about the persons
inside the bodies.

I do not deny that genuine love -- i.e. love which naturally expresses itself
in truly caring for the other person's needs, helping to bring them joy and
soothe their hurts -- can exist in homosexual relationships.  This would only
make sense; I'm well aware that members of any type of couple, straight or
gay, not only can but ought to be good friends if the relationship is going to
really satisfy either person (again, more than the body).  But it is my thesis
(not based on extensive research, but plausible from what I've read) that a
gay relationship doesn't quite satisfy, but is rather chosen as an ersatz
substitute for the wonder of knowing and being known by -- and loving and
being loved by -- a motOs, someone so different from you that probably even
after many years together, you still won't understand all the ways in which
that person's mind works differently from yours.

I guess this shoots the thesis which one frequent net.singles contributor
told me in a letter: that I'm good at expressing myself in words.  I grant
that this was a subtle point.  But I thought that what I said was that I
realized that I DO desire/love/whatever this young lady for what she is, and
that it was this realization that enabled me to know that I am truly a man
(since I have a desire such as any healthy, normal man might have), and thus
in one swell foop [sic] pretty well get rid of the homosexuality.
> And if you love other people and they also love you, wouldn't you all be
> more happy just loving each other rather than trying to pretend you don't?
Yes.  But this is not the case.  My homosexual desires, as I indicated, have
arisen when I was really in poor psychological shape; thus it's hard to class
them as ""love"" -- more as desperate need.  Anyway, most of the homosexuals of
my (casual) acquaintance seem to have a marked streak of rottenness not far
from the (usually) pleasant surface; this is not a streak of meanness or
nastiness, but rather what seems (to my casually but observantly acquainted
eye) to be self-loathing; this is not attractive.  Finally...the most powerful
homosexual desire I ever felt was when I was 27; the object of it was hardly
over half my age.  Surely you would not wish me to be pederastic?  No sense in
having a nice kid pay for my problems.
> I am not alone in thinking that it is possible to be both a Christian and
> homosexual (I can look up some references for you if you are interested).
I half agree with this.  Certainly homosexuals can become Christians.  But I
do not believe that a choice to continue in homosexuality is consistent with
Christianity.  On the other hand [we have five fingers and a thumb :-)], it
is possible that God might not remove one's homosexual desires immediately
after one becomes a Christian, or even immediately after one asks for help
from God in dealing with them.	There may be other areas of you that God
thinks need work even more than your sexuality.  But those who deliberately
continue in their homosexuality -- claiming it to be a perfectly good,
normal expression of love -- ""glory in their shame"".
I am aware of one book that has popped up on the net before, and recently
(""Christianity, Homosexuality, and Social Tolerance""), but I have not had a
chance to read it yet.
Everyone:  Did my previous article really so fail to express my true meaning
that any other intelligent person would have interpreted it as Sophie did?

I think some site upstream of us must zap most of net.motss, because rarely
do I see articles in it; most of the things I do see are, to speak frankly,
boring.
I grant (responding to a paragraph not quoted here) that I've never gotten to
be really close friends with any of the gays I know.  (For one thing, most of
them smoke, which I detest.)  Thus I don't know how they came to be as they
are.  Plus, as I implied in my previous article, most of the gays I know have
pleasant personalities and considerable talent (my acquaintance with them is
through local theatre); the self-dislike (perhaps loathing was too strong a
term) is not immediately obvious; but it seems to be there underneath the
surface in most cases.
I can only repeat what I said -- that when I felt worst about myself, my
homosexual feelings became strongest; and when I felt better, more optimistic,
about myself, my heterosexual feelings resurfaced; and the cause and effect
were in the order listed (i.e. feeling rotten CAUSED the homosexual feelings.)
Based on this and on the previous paragraph, I'm not looking for new gay
friends, and not even very much for new male friends -- not because of
homophobia, but because I'm much more interested in women, and I think it
would help me grow as a person to take the risk of becoming closer friends
with one or more women, rather than with men.  Most of my close friends for
most of my life have been male; there's nothing wrong with having male (or,
generically, same-sex) friends (it's infinitely better than having no friends
-- men are people too!); but I agree with the saying ""Vive la difference!"" --
women's personalities have some nifty good qualities that aren't there in men
(and, apparently, vice versa, since there are numerous heterosexual women),
and one whose closest relationship(s) is (are) with MOTSS's is really missing
out on some good stuff.
Basically, my question is:  Why be gay, when there's so much more joy,
interest, and wonder in being straight?  (No flames please; this is a
serious question; if the discussion gets too heavy, it can move to net.motss.)

This is all fine - but taken by itself (yes, I know Jeff had more to say),
it suggests to me not at all that there's something wrong with
homosexuality.  Rather, it suggests that Jeff is probably, deep down, a
thoroughgoing heterosexual!  (Sorry, Jeff, I had to say it.)  That being
the case, I suggest Jeff should make the best of it.  (Enjoy it, Jeff:-)
In other words, if the idea of homosexuality turns you off, don't do it.
Jeff ought to be a little more careful with analyses of causality.
Correlation, even with proper time sequence, does not imply causality (and
I wish I had taken Latin so I'd know the proper way to say that in about
five or six words).

Jeff, take that as personal, not global.  For you (and I), heterosexuality
is the way to go - so that's what we do.  There's no need to preach, or
rationalize, or explain.

Which is the chicken and which is the egg is kind of irrelevant here.  It is
*you* who makes the association between depression and homosexuality.  The
paragraph was not intended to be ""anti-religious"" at all (though you have
tended to see anything that differs with your point of view as being attacking
or anti-religious; all we are all trying to do is provide some personal
insights; isn't that what you wanted when you originally submitted an article?)
Admittedly, the word ""baggage"" could be misinterpreted, but it was meant to
have a neutral connotation; i.e., believing that something is ""sinful"", a
listed sin in the book of sins, means more to you than just ""it is wrong to
do""; it implies lowered self-worth for committing the act, potential divine
punishment, etc.; it is these things that the word ""sinful"" CARRIES with it
that I referred to as ""baggage"".)  The point is:  whether you get homosexual
feelings and get depressed, or you get depressed and feel that homosexual
feelings are somehow appropriate because of your imagined lower self-worth, due
to presumptions about what homosexual feelings MUST mean, it is *you* who have
made that association.

If I show you a book that said that belief in a deity was an aberration and a
psychosomatic disease, would you believe it?  Would you care?  I didn't think
so.  So why suddenly base your life on some other book?  Don't read a book and
believe in it to justify or legitimize your existence.  (And I'm not talking
about you-know-which-book, either!)  The notion of different sexual lifestyles
being ""aberrations"", ""abnormal"", or whatever has largely been disbanded.  One
might as well write a book labelling my tastes in music or food as
psychological disorders.  (""Mr. X is a chocophile, an cuisinial pervert who

beans.  He also eats sushi, which everyone knows to be a filthy habit.  Many

Actually, the current consensus is that everyone has the *potential* for
attraction to members of *either* sex, especially since we all have what are
described as male and female components within us (except for those people who
are ""all man"", of course :-).  Whatever one's sexual ""orientation"", it is made
out of choice.  (Those who tell you otherwise are simply evading responsibility
for making that choice.)  Again, calling attraction to members of the same sex
""severe internal damage"" is just like saying that people who hold different
religious beliefs from you have some sort of mental problem.  The idea is not
to ""help"" other people who are different from you to become more like you, but
rather for YOU to get the healing that would enable you to accept differences
in people as wonderful things instead of something to be eliminated.  Assuming
that anyone wants to be just like you (having a desire for a MOTOS, despairing
or otherwise; believing any similar belief) is equally self-damaging.  It would
seem that some of your statements have evoked harsh response from some gay
people on the net.  I hope you understand that your referring to people as
damaged or flawed psychologically is equivalent to someone saying that you
should be committed for having religious beliefs, and I hope that that
understanding helps you gain more insight into both the global and personal
issues we've discussed.  Some of the responses to you have been on the harsh
side, but realize the harshness that your statements we're perceived to have.
(See, gay people stereotype and generalize just like you do :-)  One is

""Intent""?  Are you turning into a theist?  [1/2 :-)]
Anyway, I could argue that -- in humans at least -- the primary reason for
sex is to bring the partners closer together as humans (people do need to be
touched, and that's about as touching as two people can be; plus of course
there is [I assume] a tremendous emotional and even spiritual closeness).
That new life should arise out of this immense love, and be brought into such
a loving environment, is a natural and beautiful potential consequence; but I
don't consider it the primary purpose.  After all, in the course of a
lifelong marriage, a couple would probably have intercourse thousands of
times, but only a very small percentage of those times would be with the
intention of conception; the rest would be for the fun and joy and communion
of it.

I didn't say one had to RELY on sex for closeness.  I just indicated that it
did involve a tremendous degree of closeness.  It also involves a tremendous
degree of giving of oneself; such a degree that, though I would very likely
become sexually aroused from cuddling with an attractive woman (even if
neither party explored the other's erogeneous zones), I would be hesitant to
go to bed with her unless I was already very close to her in more ways than
the physical.  It will be interesting to see what happens if/when some nice,
attractive woman and I do become very close...will we be able to restrain
ourselves?
Chuq, it might be interesting if you elaborated on your sentence beginning
""You can be at least as close....""
Sigh....  I guess one must take the bad with the good; why did sex have to
involve both ecstasy and mess?

Well, maybe SOME of us have large brains...and maybe some of us even use
them...but all (higher?) animals derive pleasure from it - in the sense
that they are thereby motivated to do it and perpetuate themselves.  What
does the thinking part of the brain have to do with it?

Homosexuality exists in many species, not just humans.  It cycles in and
out of acceptability (and correspondingly, in and out of visibility).  Gee,
either harpo!jrl doesn't know more than 20 or 30 years of history (if that
much) or I got caught in a time warp thinking that ancient Greece was a few
millenia back.  (Check out Aristophanes.)

>severe mental problems...
It's a wonder that this wasn't cross-listed to net.politics, net.flame,
net.motss,...  When harpo!jrl can tell cause from effect from irrelevant
opinion; when he can tell a liberal from a conservative; when he can
distinguish love, sex, and procreation; when he can show at least minimal
respect for others then I might be willing to consider accepting him as a
human.  For now, I'll recognize him as (allegedly) Homo sapiens, but that's
about it.

Too bad you can't feel any incipient thought processes!  Hatred is easy;
thought is a lot harder.

Put it this way:  I suppose I had mixed motives.  On the one hand, I think
we'll end up agreeing to disagree about the sources of homosexuality; coming
from a Christian viewpoint, I believe that God planned for union between a man
and a woman, and that anything else is outside His plans and hence suboptimal;
I still think there's something in a gay that makes homosexuality falsely SEEM
optimal; I'll leave it to my gay readers to figure out for themselves what
that may be in their cases, but I was hoping to at least provoke some self-
examination to help some gay toward the refreshing niftiness and healthiness
of heterosexuality; I really hoped I could be of some help.  On the other
hand, I am, alas, not free of either pride or envy: pride, that I have not
become a practicing homosexual (and thus a somewhat patronizing attitude
toward those who have); envy, that these people have at least found an SO of
some sort.  Neither the good motives nor the bad held total sway.

Speaking of theatre, my ""mysterious silence"" occurred because I took the
11th through the 14th off work in order to get the lights set for a local
theatrical production  (This is the first time I've done lighting design, so
I didn't exactly design; I just tried things to see if they worked, and it
took a long time.  Sort of like the way I program [1/2 :-)].)  Since then
I've been trying to catch up on both real work and net articles, and it does
take a while.

horny little creatures) it may be that they are continually 'on the make',
for they do rather interesting things with rocks, and coke bottles as
well. There is a particular beetle where the male of the species
emerges several weeks before the female does and spends its days
'making it' with the orchids (which look rather like female beetles
due to natural selection).
Young bulls (the sort that in the wild would get the sand beaten
out of them by the bigger males who would also get the herd) have
homosexual relations with each other. This is common among other
herd animals as well. Even today, farmers that do not use artificial
insemination have been known to own large, prize winning bulls that
have no interest in the heifers that the farmer wants to breed with
that bull. My great-grandfather (who was dead before I was born)
was reputed to have such a bull, and he kept young male bulls around
to stimulate that bull before presenting him with the heifers.
