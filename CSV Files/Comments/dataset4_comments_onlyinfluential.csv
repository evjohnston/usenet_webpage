""Darwinism"" that was essentially a net.origins flame to the extent that, if
Darwin was right and we evolve to be fit, why is over 95% of our brain
capacity superfluous?
	The argument, like most anti-evolution arguments was specious because
it assumes some predefined plan determines evolution rather than just
reproductive fitness.  Hence, the fact that the neurons just went along for
the ride cannot be discounted.
[This may have originally also been posted to net.sci, as well as net.origins.
 For the former (net.sci), why clutter it when net.bio is more appropriate,
 as for the latter (net.origins), what do you think am I, crazy?]
	However, in a discussion of AIDS and other neurotropic viruses, a
possible evolutionary selection for excess neurons became obvious.
	We forget, living in a developed country with vaccine programs about
all the childhood viral illnesses (polio, smallpox, measles, rubella, mumps)
not to mention bacterial infections capable of causing fever high enough
to initiate seizures and destroy brain tissue.
	We also forget that the average life expectancy has substantially
increased since 1800.
	If having excess neurons allows half to be destroyed in childhood
without early dementia, then it provides a clear evolutionary advantage.
Humans (or ancestors) might then live to the ripe old age of 40 with their
mental faculties intact, rather than dying secondary to senility at age 20,
giving them, not incidentally, an extra 10+ years of reproductive life.
	Hence, the evolutionary advantages of ""excess"" capacity become
clear, even without long semantic arguments about having to define
what is ""excess.""

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.

central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.

about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

I appreciate your sentiment, but let's keep some perspective.  It's  a  lot
easier  and  cheaper  to  make a soldier than a doctor.  Also, the level of
intelligence required to be a doctor is found in a much smaller  percentage
of the population than that required for a soldier.
I suspect the figures even out considerably if you compare dollar costs  or
times  required  for  training  soldiers  and  doctors. (You could even try
summing IQ's (-: ).
A more relevant question is:  Can one doctor adequately serve 1,050 people?
My  understanding  is  there's currently a surplus of doctors in the United
States.  It's the uneven distribution that causes problems.

Again, the wrong question is implied.  More relevant:  Would spending  more
than  $140 million dollars annually significantly speed up the finding of a
cure for AIDS?  I'd cheerfully trade a couple of F-16's  for  a  cure,  but
it's not at all clear that such a tradeoff exists.

	No, $140M in a year probably wouldn't cure AIDS, but one tenth of that
could vaccinate every child in America fully, which would probably save just
as many lives.

Not to say that Craig's sentiment is incorrect, but the figures I have
seen for the cost of an F-16 are quite different. According to ""The
Arsenal of Democracy"", we have paid the following prices for F-16s:
1979	145 @ $ 9.482 M
1980	175 @ $ 9.465 M
1981	120 @ $14.088 M
1982	120 @ $17.608 M
1983	120 @ $18.704 M
1984	144 @ $17.717 M
1985	150 @ $24.900 M
Two F-16s shouldn't be more than $50 to $70 M in 1986.
Some of the prices we have charged other
countries for F-16s include:
Iran
	160 @ $14.844 M, 1978, including a contribution to F-16 R&D costs
Israel
	75  @ $15.453 M, 1978

	Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated 
Immune Suppression.  (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional 
dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)
	Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic 
disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.
	The white blood cell count is in the normal range.  But given a
Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated.  So, seeing it in the normal
range is akin to seeing it depressed.  This is in agreement with the findings
of oral thrush.
	What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:
	Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses
(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal
tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in
Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the
hormone ACTH.  Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the
immune suppression is rarely quite this severe.
	Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)
and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease).  In a young woman, 
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most
commonly encountered Cancers.
	In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible
tumors.  Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,
(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.
	The Pneumonia:
	Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.
Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it
causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible
as white on X-ray.
	Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although
may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is
necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
	Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to
TB.  It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but
because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin
with.
	A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or
even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)
	As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism
Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed
patients.
	THE DIAGNOSIS:
	Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)
	Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
	As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant
needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone
maintenance.  Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.
Confirming the Diagnosis:
#1	A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an
inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers
	Explanation:  T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells
and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to
tease them apart)  The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less
Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in
many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.
#2	An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the
patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.
I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that
they had those symptoms.  It was an abbreviated description, and I don't 
want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""
	Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the
workings of the medical model.

that shook me out my everyday torpor and placidity.  I was completely
surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers.
A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner
party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his.
We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked
our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration.  The
night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and
details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a
third person living with them who has AIDS.  We finished getting the
particulars and hung up, not missing a beat.  What was most remarkable
was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although
we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.)  First, though it may
surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with
it or knew someone who died of it.  I think that for the great majority of
gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always
on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial,
like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked.  I had
never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had.
Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have,
and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out.  I
was appalled at myself. I had three reactions.  First, anger and
disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone
whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social
smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL
anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's
condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially
honorable excuse from the obligation.  Finally, and just as surprising, a
real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the
disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across
the dinner table, but even that offering little solace.  Luckily, I could
see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful
of how the evening would turn out.
As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a
enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS
was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face
of social company and chitchat.  Life looks almost normal until you see the
oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest
indoors and a quilt on his legs.  But he kept up his own before and during
dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year
came in.  And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal
debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the
daily routine as one can accomodate.  But, I think we made three new friends
that night, and that we'll see them again pretty soon.

or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

No.  These only make people who are already non-smokers feel smug.
When I was a smoker they actually served to remeind me of how much
I wanted a cigarette.   Perhaps, as dave suggests, I was a non-thinking

Bingo!
If someone who smokes quits, it will be at a time of his choosing and
for his own reasons.  When someone assails them with the ""Smoking is
bad for you because..."" tirade, they think, ""Boy, this person thinks
I'm so stupid that I don't know all of this.  If he thinks I'm going
to pay any attention to such an arrogant and holier-than-thou jerk, he's
got another think coming.""
In other words, all that will happen if you spout off about the perils
of smoking is that you will totally discredit yourself in the eyes of
the person that you're supposedly trying to help.  (I say ""supposedly"",
because there really are a lot of arrogant and holier-than-thou jerks
out there who don't really want to help at all; they just want to
denigrate smokers so that they'll feel superior).
Okay, so what *can* you do?  First, examine your own motives.  Honestly.
If you feel superior to those who smoke, then kindly keep your mouth
shut (most ex-smokers fall into this category).  Your conceited braying
is obvious to almost everyone, and smokers in particular find it down-
right funny that you think that you're better than they are.
If you don't like the idea that maybe smokers are actually *enjoying*
doing something that you personally would never ever do, then you too
are requested to keep your notions to yourself and your kind.
If you don't like being exposed to smoke, you might try the almost
always ignored route of simply asking the smokers that you deal with to
be considerate of you.  Insist that restaurants have a non-smoking
section, since you can hardly be expected to ask every stranger at
every nearby table to be considerate.  (It probably wouldn't work,
anyway).
If you're concerned about smoking as a ""public health menace"", then
concentrate on *prevention*.  A lot has already been done in this area,
especially on television where ads have been banned and most characters
don't smoke.
If you are concerned about the health of someone special to you, then
you have a difficult time ahead.  Your best bet is to *never* bring up
the subject of smoking; that person already knows damn well about the
hazards.  Instead, make sure that the ""someone special"" knows that
they *are* special to you, and that their health is something that you
care very deeply about.  But this must be communicated subtly, in a
*caring* tone, not in a *lecturing* tone.  It will take a long time;
maybe months, maybe years.  But eventually they will decide *on their
own* that they should give up the habit because it endangers something
that *you* care about.

I agree wholeheartedly.  The ""reminder"" factor is one of the biggest
obstacles to those trying to quit as well.  This goes for both positive
and negative reminders.  When you are trying to quit, you really want to
forget that there are such things as cigarettes and tobacco.

I was about to followup in the same line, but Doug's posting says it
much more clearly than I ever could.  It is the people that you are
close to, who care about you -- that you love -- who have the most
impact on your ability or inability to stop smoking.

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

You are assuming that the person you entrust your care to has not misrepresented
his abilities as a healer.  The point is that a large amount of damage may be
done by someone who is misrepresenting him/herself to a small, but nonetheless
gullible segment of society.  Also remember that how gullible a potential
victim is depends on how fast a talker the ""healer"" in question is.  Although
the number of charlatans at large may be small, the potential damage that they
can cause is large, hence the requirement of licensure for the physician.
Remember - I'm not arguing for taking away the right of an INFORMED consumer
of health care to go to who they want, but I think the potential for abuse of
an UNINFORMED consumer makes licensure necessary.

	While my classmates and I found the definition amusing, there was a

	We're spending 4-7 years working 90 hour weeks (and that's a light

	It is not illegal to seek medical care from a non-licensed ""healer"".
It is only illegal to offer to GIVE medical care without benefit of a license.
	The question I have is 'Why would you even WANT to entrust your broken
arm to an unlicensed practitioner?'  Without even being a board certified
Orthopedist, I can think of at least a dozen complications of a broken arm
that could cripple one for life or even kill. A license is just a form of
consumer protection, nothing more.

The Good Samaritan Law was passed to prevent the increasingly common occurence
of normal people, say giving someone CPR, and then getting sued for breaking
a few ribs.  Based on that information, the logic fails.
	Besides, the good samaritan is offering to give First Aid, not
comprehensive medical care.  But the fact that they had to pass the good
samaritan laws proved that at least some lawyers found it profitable to argue
that yes, they were breaking the law. (I don't agree, and I also believe in
altruism as a motive.)

	Didn't you read what I said. It's not illegal at all.  I even kept the
line in above [ if you can go back a screenful]
	It may be legal, but it sure ain't smart -- especially for the example
chosen (broken bone).

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

says, it can't hurt and may be helpful.  The only reservation is for those
who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such
""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, and
hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the
least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine.  This is the only reason he
is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

for HTLV-3.
	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

as well as the effects the generation of electrical currents, by those
amalgams, have on the total stress created by the amalgams.  Dr.

My first impulse was to smile at Byron Howes comments.  However, he
writes like a thinking person---he is just seriously underinformed.
He makes his comments based on the flimsiest amount of information
and, like most humans, tends to judge others on his standards.  I
would be a fool to make comments that had not been substantiated
beyond any reasonable doubt.  What possible motive could I have for
doing such a thing?  Mr. Howes assumption that I am a fool reflects
more on him than it does on me.  I have found it much safer to assume
that the other person has the highest level of ability and integrity
until proven otherwise.  That attitude has placed me much closer to
the truth, while vastly improving what I can learn from that person,
than assuming the worst and missing out.

standards for choosing what to share does not allow for anything I'm
likely to have to eat somewhere down the road.  If I EVER have to
""eat"" something I will consider it a learning experience & thank (and
admire) the person who fed it to me.  However, unless I happen to have
the research data accidentally close at hand, I will not be routinely

Oooh! An attack!  Good.
Here's the story.  
On several occasions you have made reference to articles in the popular
media (Newsweek, CBS) on various aspects of health.  You have then gone
on to exposit your favorite theories and statistics as if the articles
you refer to presented them.  Often the articles or reports you look to
for support specifically *contradict* your claims.
I consider this practice both dishonest and deceptive.  You can at least
stop essentially misquoting the sources you claim to represent, as with
the toxicity level of mercury in amalgum filling.  If I find you dishonest
in this respect, how am I to believe your less substantiated claim?
Certainly not without sources.  
Remember, *you* are the one offering cures, not me.  I only report what I
see and hear that I feel you have misrepresented.  I am not a doctor nor
any kind of health practitioner.  I am simply someone leery of snake-oil
salesmen who is trying to do the best for his health as he can.  I expect
those offering panacaea's to do a better job with facts than you seem to
be capable of.
>I am continually amazed at the low opinion some readers of the net

You have been the one accusing AMA related physicians of the same sort of
thing!  I see you like being on the receiving end of that sort of cr*p
about as much as Bill Oliver does.  Perhaps you will begin to tone down
your own accusations.

This tells me nothing.  I've known *lots* of perennial graduate students.
What is the *source* (and the precise levels found) of your data on
mercury toxicity in amalgum fillings.  According to the CBS report, which
you originally cited, even Dr. Morgan admits that this is only a problem
with people particularly sensitive to heavy-metal poisoning (I don't know
what that means, but it seems different from what you are saying.)

Like I said originally, the ADA (or whatever professional Dentist's

b*tches, they don't count, right :->  They do disagree with you, or

I don't claim to be informed.  I'm just noting that while you and I
claim to have seen the same CBS report, your article said very different
things about it than I saw.  The same happened with the Newsweek report
about sugar.  You made very different claims for the article than were
actually in the text of the article.
In what *other* ways are you making misstatements of fact that I don't
know about if my poor feeble underinformed brain can spot these.

I haven't the faintest idea what your motives are, and I don't care.
I'm only afraid that serious damage (not to mention expense) is going
to be incurred from misinformation, from any quarter.

I think Bill Oliver has noted that simply isn't true.  You impune the
ability and integrity of all AMA related doctors all the time.  I'll
let the readers of this newsgroup decide whether I am a fool or not.
That is hardly relevant.

I routinely distrust individuals unwilling to make their complete arguments
publicly. I've been through this with the fundamentalists and the creationists
and I'll go through it with you.  If you believe what you have to say is
important, than back it up.  As one of the posters to net.origins is very
fond of saying ""extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof"" not simply
your word or promises of references.

What time is this, Walt?  Again, are you seriously interested in people's
health and well being or merely proving yourself ""superior"" to mainstream
medicine.  Understand, I have no disagreement with Holistic medicine or
the concept thereof.  Some of your ideas may be accurate.  There is
possibly much to be learned there.
So long as you continue to misrepresent others, however, in an effort to
""sell"" your position I find I am unable to distinguish truth from falsehood
in what you say.  I certainly am not going to take you very seriously if
I feel I have found evidence (which I do) that you are selling me a bill
of goods with little substance.

There are four stages of societal response to the discovery of
radically new concepts (in this order):     
     #1  Ignore it and it will go away.
     #2  Ridicule
     #3  Attack 
     #4  Total acceptance:  ""Well, that's obvious!  We knew that all
         the time!
Twice now, Steve has ridiculed something I have placed on the net;
only to have strong evidence to the contrary be published within a few
days of his unsupported position.  His response has been to regress
(like the child who reverts to bedwetting when the new baby is brought
home from the hospital) from the relatively advanced societal response
of ridicule to the relatively more primitive strategy of ignoring.
Sorry Steve,  you're going to have to work harder and harder to ignore
what is rushing, like an avalanche, into all our lives.  Just today,
in one of the many Medical Journals I read every day, in the special
section called Medical Ethics (appropriate, I think), Thomas Preston,
MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine
& Chief of Cardiology at Pacific Medical Center, joined my side.  In a
one page statement,""Palliative Care No Match for Prevention of
Disease"", one more outstanding clinician points out exactly my
position: Reference--Medical World News/September 9, 1985 (page 19).
The same day two more articles in the same vein: Family Practice News/
September 1-14, 1985, page 16, ""Medicare Asked to Take Part in
Promoting 'Wellness'"" & page 18 (same issue) ""Promoting Healthier
Life-Styles Challenging, Rewarding"".
Even the AMA has already reached the last of the four societel
responses.  In American Medical News/September 13, 1985, the
announcement is made that the third special supplement to Newsweek by
the AMA appears in the Sept. 9th edition, titled: ""To your health!
Building and keeping a healthy body.""  The supplement covers such
topics as nutrition, exercise, and disease prevention.  The only
professional national medical organization that specializes in this
field is the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA).  For the
past 7 years, since the beginning of the AHMA, the AMA has done as
much as it legally could to stifle it.  The very things the AMA is now
claiming for its own has been practiced for many years by Holistic
Medical Practitioners.  Of course, the AHMA is now practicing an
advanced form of what was known 7 years ago.  It will be years before
the conventional medical practitioner catches up though catch up they
will eventually.  It should already be considered malpractice to offer
less than is known.  Eventually that may be what forces many MDs to go
back to learn all this new stuff.  
Trying to pitch the offerings to the net to satisfy the lowest common
denominator would be a sad thing for the rest of us.  Maybe we can
create a ""special class for slow learners like the Steve Dyers"".

I have stated twice, Walt, that my facts were taken from the articles
in Newsweek you claim to have read and the CBS (and CNN) news reports
you claim to have seen.  I submit that either by deliberation or by
simple inability to grasp ideas you have misrepresented the medical
findings in those very same sources to the network and perhaps to
yourself.  Whatever the reason, I find this behavior in a health pro-
fessional very frightening.
If it makes you feel any better, I wouldn't entrust myself to an
AMA-type doctor who was incapable of correctly drawing simple
conclusions either.  (This has nothing to do with the correctness
of the conclusions, but the correctness of the process of drawing
conclusions.)  If I see that a person cannot reliably draw facts
from material I am familiar with, what am I to think about the facts
drawn from material I am not familiar with?

Here is my personal opinion. I have known many people on both
sides of this issue. The unorthodox group is often guilty
of an unscientific approach lacking in logic. The orthodox
group seems to go too far in the other direction, trying to
reduce everything to ""logic and scientific materialism"".
(not that I accuse Steve of this, I just used the above
 as a starting point for this letter.)
I thought that Godel's incompleteness theorems, Quantum
physics and such had blown scientific materialism out of
the water, at least as far as being a ""true"" description
of the world. What the unorthodox approach has in its favor
is often based on personal experience, which tends to be
difficult to treat scientifically.
I think that the orthodox group might benefit from practices
promoting personal experience (perhaps Yoga/meditation, fasting
or whatever), while the unorthodox group might benefit from
a study of logic.

Garbage, Walt, and you know it!  When you stop misrepresenting facts I
*might* begin to take you seriously.  So long as you continue to deceive,
distort and downright lie to promote your position, you are going to have
to expect that folks will be suspicious of what you say.  I don't want

Sure, Walt.  All AMA-type physicians were/are against prevention so they
can make big bucks providing useless cures.  Nobody ever looked at
stress as a causative factor in disease until the holistic physicians
came around, nobody was ever aware of dietary factors in disease until
holistic physicians came to be and nobody knew about the relationship
between diet and mood until holistic physicians discovered it.  (The above
paragraph is to be read with heavy sarcastic tones.)

You read it here folks.  Say, Walt, how come I learned all of these things
in elementary school -- before the American Holistic Medical Association
came to be.  Looks to me like the situation is reversed:  you, in the name
of the AHMA, are claiming for your own the very thing that have been
practiced for years by members of the AMA.  Again, this is a false repre-
sentation and you probably know it!

Those on the ""orthodox"" side have personal experiences too.
Sometimes these experiences include controlled double blind experiments.
Amazing how the personal experiences of the ""unorthodox"" are almost
never reproducible by non-true believers in that particular
""unorthodoxy"".  In those few cases when they ARE reproducible, they
quickly become the new orthodoxy.

I would like to clarify my comment, in case there are others like Walt
who may have misinterpreted me.  I was not proposing ""ignoring"" crackpots, as
much as refusing to engage in extended debate.  I have seen too many other

Well, I will risk being branded as a heretic and say that the fact
that an experience is not reproducible does not mean it is invalid.
(Unfortunately if one is willing to accept reports of such experiences
one is likely to be victimized by charlatans and/or irrational people.)
Some things may not be susceptible to experimental verification
(isn't there a principle in physics that observing an event changes it?)
I am not rejecting the scientific method. I am surrounded by
these holistic types out here in Northern California and for
years have been trying to get some of them to be more rational.
But I also think they do a lot of good.
I would also like to state that I do not have as much faith
in the representatives of orthodoxy as you seem to. I seem
to recall that some pioneers in science have been put through all
kinds of persecutions before their views became the new orthodoxy.
Perhaps some correct views never were accepted. How do you know?

Unfortunately no-one never claimed that it's the ""true"" description of
the world. All we can say is that so far it works, unlike any other
model of the world that I've ever heard of. Of course choosing a model
based on ""what works"" is part of SM in the first place, but what better

I'm not so sure that noone ever claimed scientific materialism
is a true description of the world. (Isn't something along
those lines part of Marxist doctrine?) But anyway basically what
I was trying to say is that it is a good model (actually quite
an amazingly good model), but that it should be understood as
being a model rather than truth. As you say, choosing a model
based on what works is part of what SM is all about, as I
understand it.
My particular pet theory which I've been trying to integrate
with existing models is rather controversial and has to do
with adding as an axiom the existence of a soul, without saying
anything about God, religion etc. Since this is somewhere
out in left-field as far as most people are concerned I
won't burden you with the details ... (this view is
heretical both to religious and materialistic types ...)
What I like about Godel's theorems, Quantum physics, etc.,
is that they seem to suggest something mysterious is going
on that isn't readily explainable. I like mysteries ...
Apologies to the readers for burdening them with my personal
opinions ... I won't put any more of this in the net.

While I certainly agree that this is so, I don't think you can really
fault the physicians.  It is not they who research medical matters;
they can only apply whatever information the researchers provide.
And I can't even fault the researchers, inasmuch as there are still
a number of ""sicknesses"" that I'd rather see cures/prevention for
(AIDS, MS, and cancer to name just a few), rather than have them
spending their time and money on researching ""better wellness"".
Perhaps after all of the ""dread diseases"" have been wiped out the
way that smallpox has, conventional medicine can turn its attention
to ""well people"".  I'm not sure what they'd be trying to do, though.

Dear Frank,
Holistic Medicine has the cures for your list.  When I practiced
Conventional Medicine alone I had no cures for any of your list.
In addition, the cures for the ills on your list have many powerful

	Whenever someone asks me how bad AIDS is, I respond, ""Well at least it
isn't as bad as Lassa Fever.""
	It begins with fever, malaise, muscle aches, and a sore throat (just
like a cold.)  However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces every
organ to close shop.
	Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseases
known to man.  It was first described in the early 70s by a group of Columbia
U. researchers.
	The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in a 
missionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.
After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospital
in Jos, where she died the next day.
	Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of the
disease, and a third was deathly ill.  She was flown to New York (prompting
several staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )
and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,
survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.
	Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to study 
additional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing the
epidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,
the first outbreak's final victim.
	(Source: Ten Diseases You Were Better Off Not Knowing About)
	(        G. Thomas, MD and L. Shreiner, MD _That's_Incurable_)
	Lassa Fever is not AIDS.
	However, in a final twist, Suramin, one of the antiviral drugs used
to treat Lassa fever, is currently undergoing clinical trials against the
AIDS virus.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

-------
I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

Since dentists learned that sugar caused cavities they have been in
the forefront of the research involving sugar.  The medical profession
has been ""johnnie come latelies"" in this field.
As far back as 1964 dental research had shown that a moderate dose of
sugar was sufficient to drastically reduce the ""phagocytic index"".
For those of you who don't know:  The phagocytic index is a measure of
how many bacteria a white blood cell ingests in one hour.  It is a
very accurate measure of one form of immunity.  Now that AIDS research
$ has made it possible to measure many aspects of immunity in fine
detail, and sugar has hit the ""big time"" by being on the cover of
Newsweek, I'm sure it won't be long before these studies are repeated
measuring many more parameters.
I will just list the table that summarizes that first study and wait
for the predictable denials from those who still don't want to know:

       1964
This study has, of course, been replicated many times.  The last time
that I am aware of was by Emanual Cheraskin, MD, DDS, who was Chairman
of the department of Dentistry at the University of Alabama Dental
School at the time.  He has gone on to dedicate his life to educating
the public, and any professionals who will listen, of the pervasive
health burdens caused by refined carbohydrates.
The same amount of glucose ingested in an unrefined state (in other
words, with all the 48+ nutrients it grew up with--in the exact
proportion that it existed in nature) causes no reduction in the
phagocytic index.
You know, a grain of wheat is alive.  No matter how long it is in
storage it is slowly running its own ""Krebs cycle""(the same metabolic
cycle we humans use to process all forms of carbohydrates).  Those 48+
nutrients are present in the exact proportion, and in the exact amount,
necessary to digest exactly the amount of carbohydrate in that grain
of wheat. Nature is pretty tidy that way.
If we eat the grain of wheat as it is we get everything needed to
metabolize exactly that much starch.  If we allow the food processors
to remove the 48+ nutrients first, then, when we eat the refined
product, our bodies must take those 48+ nutrients from storage in
order to run the ""Krebs Cycle"".  So long as a certain % of refined
foods is not exceeded the human has reserves enough to get along.  The
best estimate by those who have taken the time to understand the field
(so far as we do understand it) is that we can tolerate about 15% of
our carbohydrates refined.  Above 15%, even with our presently
available crude measuring techniques, measurable decreases in function
occur.  The present average in this country is 60% refined &
increasing every year.  We have but to look at comparable statistics
from Guam (which has persistantly led our % here in the US by about 5
years--presently 65%+) to see what we can expect of our future chronic
disease incidence.
The problem is not a lack of research data but the unwillingness to
accept things that hit so close home as our own eating habits--one of
the most personal of things.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

Some topic suggestions:
I have a mild comes-and-goes psorisis.  I use a cortisone cream, but
find that it is much better in the summer (lying in the sun) than
the winter.  Causes? Cures?  Infectious?  Long-term dangers?
On a completely different topic,
My brother is an oncologist.  He mentioned that he heard from another
doctor at a party that autopsies of Alzheimer's disease patients showed
increased levels of aluminum in their brain tissue.  ""And what do
doctors recommend for their oldsters?  Maalox, of course.""
Feel free to take it from there.
(My brother was one of the generation that received X-ray treatment
for their tonsils.  He went through med school on an Air-Force
scholarship where he promised to serve after school.  At his pre-induction
physical, he was asked ""Doctor, why do you have a 15% hearing loss on
one side?""  Turned out to be a brain tumor, which was operated on
successfully.  He had a thyroidectomy subsequently.  (This was over 15
years ago.)  This gave him a unique perspective on oncology, of course.
I haven't heard too much about the effects of these treatments, though
I know three people who had them, all of whom have some ill effects.
Most of the net readers grew up after the X-ray treatment era, but
a summary/followup might be interesting.

#####################
I'm not sure about topics, but there were two spot radio announcements
by Carlton Fredricks, PhD, that I remember.  Fredricks is a nutritionist
(whatever that means).  He has several books published about nutritional
deficiencies and/or approaches for treatment/relief of certain conditions.
He was sponsored by Lindberg Nutrition which is a chain of Health Food 
stores in LA.
1.  Fredricks claimed that the symptoms of arthritis could be eliminated
or substantially reduced by complete elimination of the foods of the
nightshade family from the diet.  There were 5 items mentioned.  Three of
them were potatoes, tomatoes, and rutabaga.  I don't remember the other two.
Potatoes and tomatoes might take a little doing to eliminate (spaghetti,
lasagna, pizza, etc.) but it seemed to me that someone in the grip of
arthritis would regard that as a small price to pay for substantial relief.
The other two items were even less common than rutabaga.
2.  Fredricks related the story that if a farmer had a cow that couldn't
conceive and called the vet, the first thing the vet would ask is ""What's
the animal been eating?""  But if a woman goes to her doctor to complain about
infertility, the *last* thing the doctor asks is ""what have you been eating?""
(This story obviously doesn't prove anything, but somehow seems to strike
a responsive chord in me).

I am replying just in case this is NOT a joke.
No, you are not paranoid, just uninformed.
Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained
in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation
and opinion.
I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in
the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). 
My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets
DIRECTLY into your bloodstream.
The evidence:
1. The virus has been found in the following
bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.
2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because
during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts
into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen
deposited there can get directly into the blood stream.
3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because
remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.
4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse
because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.
5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because
the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into
the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in
her/his mouth.
6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.

the obvious.  But, as of this point, the evidence that AIDS can be transmitted
by semen has been only circumstantial, although fairly strong (its spread by
sexual transmission and the fact that the virus has been cultured out of
semen). 
	However, last week, doctors in Australia reported four cases of
women with AIDS whose only risk factor was being artificially inseminated
with sprem that was later found to be contaminated. This marks the first time
that transmission by semen can be documented in cases where all other modes
of transmission (i.e. blood-borne) can be ruled out.
	I just thought this might also be of interest to those who are
still wondering to what rigors medical 'proof' must be subjected to.

Subject: The Immune System and Cancer.
	In response to an article I pointed out that described the 
(albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions
pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying
CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system.
	At the time, I did not respond.  I could have said 'Well, it just
ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you
have proof?""
	Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development
of cancer is caused by a weak immune system?  After several months of
thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done.""
	(I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.)
	Point 1:  In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system,
it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*]  Despite, years of searching, only three
tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics
(called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it
is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another
is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously
infected by Epstein-Barr Virus.  In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago
almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short
round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune
system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection,
respectively).  The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, 
although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it
was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and
hence not attacked.  The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never
occur in the USA.
	* [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign'
entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be
'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally
encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.']
	Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer
has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones
that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were 
never detected.
	This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing),
and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not
constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the 
Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.]
	Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for
cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can.
	Point 2:
	The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system
and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line.  Obviously, this
cannot be done.  It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I
doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway.
	However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already
been one, one by nature, and another by medicine.  I am referring to the
11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome),
and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be
artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ.
	The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often
than the population at large?""  In the case of the AIDS population, the
answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very
frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma.
(But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital
has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980.  They now get that
many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.)  Both of these only occur in 
certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result
of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like
Burkitt's Lymphoma.
	As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased
risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants.  (It may actually
be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating
to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.)
	So there you have it,  indirect but as near as can be definitive 
disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer,
or I should say, most cancer.
[Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free
survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if
death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor
at post-mortem exam.""  Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it
is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.]

It is a very very far cry from noting that nonoxynol-9 inactivates

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

Or even ""Sorry, I am getting together with a friend Friday, how about

I think the use of ""platonic friendship"" might mislead us from the issue.
Are we talking about becoming sexual with good friends, or are we talking
about when to first have sex with a new romantic interest?  I think you
meant the latter.
My advice is that you have to learn from experience what
is right for you. I know that for myself, there has to be a physical attraction
from the start as well as a non-physical interest in the person. If there is
insufficient non-physical interest, nothing will develop after we have sex,
and after the sex is no longer ""mysterious"" with him, my interest in seeing him
will decrease rapidly. If there is insufficient physical attraction, I will
quickly become disinterested in the sex, and the relationship with end unless
he is interesting enough non-physically to be a ""platonic"" friend.
The only point at which TIMING of the first sex is important is that there
is enough interaction beforehand that I get to know if/how he is
non-physically interesting to me. This is important because this interest
is necessary for me to sustain romantic feelings just in case the sex winds
up just so-so.
I know that since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, I have been more interested
in ""dating"" with the goal of ""settling down"" with someone. However, speaking
health-wise, sex in the context of a ""relationship"" is no safer than
""recreational"" sex unless the two of you have had sex with no one else in
the past five or so years.","kXT4-cARIZsJ",9,1986-01-09,6,17

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

Of course, the recommendation to avoid exchanging bodily fluids only
makes sense if either or both haven't been absolutely monogamous for the
past 5 or 6 years.  But even today's good boys and girls might not have
been in such a covetable position for that entire period--if one interprets
the recommendations strictly, even a single ""unsafe"" sexual experience since
1980 is enough to no longer feel 100% assured.
While I think it's great to be monogamous if that's OK with you two, it's
also pretty obvious that these recommendations are directed towards those
who haven't been practicing monogamy.  And that includes a lot more than
those whom you would call promiscuous.

       and  cold  war within the gay community""	by Marshall K. Kirk
       and ""Erastes Pill"", in ""Christopher Street"", issue 77.
       ""Amongst	ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank	and
       power  in the gay world,	and the	opposing sides are drawn in
       terms of	self-identification and	public appearance.  What is
       worse,  this  struggle for hierarchy will continue unless we
       abandon some of the dogmas of the gay establishment. ...
       ""The shared impressions and arguments  put  forth  here	are
       tentative,  our generalizations are riddled with	exceptions,
       and we imagine that some	of our speculations will be  proved
       incorrect.
       ""First, consider	two modes of self-perception. ...  Many	gay
       men  like  to  identify themselves either as 'straight gays'
       (R-types) or not	(Q-types).
       R-types view themselves
       ""Rs like	to think that they pass	as straights on	the street.
       They  value  highly their acceptance in general society,	and
       many are	careful	to  sustain  friendships  in  the  straight
       community.   Rs	are  proud  of	their manly appearance,	and
       typically rankle	over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
       gay  males.   They  may	be  receptive to, or even obsessive
       about,  social  conventions  and	 norms	based	on   gender
       distinction;  ...   completely  homosexual Rs may persist in
       describing themselves as	'bisexual.'
       ""The one	thread connecting the  childhoods  of  Rs  we  have
       interviewed  is	peer  acceptability.  By and large, Rs were
       kids who, for one reason	 or  another,  could  conform  with
       ease,  and  so did. ...	Young Rs, it seems, were only dimly
       aware of	 their	need  for  the	rewards	 of  acceptability,
       effortlessly   achieved.	   So  the  arrival  of	 adolescent
       sexuality sent a	stunning shock	through	 well-adjusted	Rs.
       ...   Many  boys	 ignored and disguised this discovery until
       they could come to terms	with it.  In the meantime,  teenage
       Rs  struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer
       image.  Even as they grew up to enjoy sex with other boys on
       the  sly, conformism in all other aspects of demeanor became
       the self-exacted	quid pro quo.
       Q-types view themselves
       ""... these gays often are not, and feel	that  they  do	not
       wish  to	 be, 'straight-acting and appearing.' The extreme Q
       is a homosexual on display.   (He  may  not  always  be	one
       display ... [e.g.] in the presence of family and	employers.)
       On the street, he may assume any	one of the  several  public
       personas	 most  familiar	 to the	straight world:	the pomaded
       and permed 'fem', the titanic leather  master,  the  clipped
       clone,  the  GQ	hyperboy, and others. ...  Qs are outwardly
       gayified; they have bought into strict outgroup	stereotypes
       which, whether screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
       constitute  a  burlesque	 of  gender  roles.   Qs  think	 of
       themselves  as visible gays, and	tend to	make such a profile
       central to their	ego structure. ...
       ""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,  and  Qs	are
       perhaps more likely than	Rs to be drawn toward the asylum of
       gay ghettos in urban centers. ...
       ""Whereas	Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and	 so
       did, many Qs felt that, for whatever reasons, they could	not
       conform during their youth, and so did not.   Those  reasons
       might  include passivity, effeminacy, homeliness, remarkable
       prettiness, lack	of athletic  skill,  or	 almost	 any  other
       cause   for   unpopularity  among  male	youth.	 At  first,
       evidently, many Qs were unhappy loners  who  salvaged  their
       self-esteem by making a lodestar	virtue out of individualism
       rather than peer	acceptance.  But  non-conformity  engenders
       anti-conformism.	  So  some  Qs	went further and acquired a
       taste for  outrageousness,  actively  calculating  shock	 to
       others  in  order to reinforce their social status as rebels
       with a cause. ...
       ""As the years go	by, and	they learn that	they are not alone,
       Qs  adopt zealously the visible uniforms	and credos of their
       supporting outgroups. ...  Surveys have shown that, for many
       Qs,  camp  behavior  is	a  passing phase of overt defiance,
       toned down in later years.
       ""When those gays	who boast R-status meet	 those	who  defend
       Q-status, there can be trouble.	First, let's look at things
       for the viewpoint of the	 R.   For  one	thing,	the  sexual
       objects	of  Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs, for the most part
       are scorned. ...	 It is the 'fem' [from among the variety of
       Q-type  personas]  who bears the	brunt of the invective from
       Rs. ...
       ""[Gay] bars are often regarded by  Rs  as  the  bastions	 of
       self-segregated	Qs - branded as	twinkie	bars, leather bars,
       etc. - and so may be viewed with	distaste. ...
       ""We should mention at this point	that those Rs who shun	the
       bars  find it more difficult to lead satisfactory sex lives.
       They have trouble meeting other Rs because,  unlike  visible
       Qs,  out	 in  the  straight  world most Rs have banished	any
       tell-tale signals of  homosexuality  from  their	 conformist
       uniforms	and are	wary of	mistaken self-exposures. ...
       ""To make	sexual matters still more difficult  for  many	Rs,
       they  face two more unique dilemmas. ...	 First,	... a Q	may
       be drawn	to,  and  satisfied  by,  a  relationship  with	 an
       acceptably  masculine  R.   But what of the classic R-type -
       the 'all-American boy' whose only felt  shortcoming  is	his
       sexual  preference?   For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual
       object possessing the one feature  he  feels  he	 lacks	and
       wishes  to  capture - may very well be the straight boy,	who
       is, by definition, unattainable.	...
       ""The second sexual dilemma faced	by Rs involves	the  ritual
       of  sex-play  itself.   For  at	least  some  Rs,  it seems,
       masculine role performance is the  most	thrilling  part	 of
       sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened in homosexual practices
       such as passive anal sex	or active fellatio. ...
       ""But even if the	 R  is	contentedly  'out'  to	family	and
       friends,	 and  self-exposure  is	 not an	issue, he may still
       dislike Qs for two related reasons.
       ""First, because the R has typically conformed with  ease	 to
       the  mainstream,	 the  exaggerated  outgroup  displays of Qs
       simply baffle him.  Why would any person	choose to draw such
       public ridicule and abuse, he wonders? ...  'I don't see	why
       they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
       [we  interviewed].   'It	 obviously looks phony and fools no
       one.' At	best, then, many Rs come to view Qs  the  way  that
       many  straights view homosexuals	en bloc, as somehow foolish
       and trivial, a nationality of sterile cuckoos. ...
       ""Second,	Qs do more than	baffle Rs - they also  irritate	 Rs
       terribly,  to  a	 degree	that more detached straights cannot
       understand.  Many Rs plainly resent  being  identified  with
       the  Qs,	and blame them for the weird profile of	homosexuals
       as a whole. ...
       ""Like most gay males, it	seems,	even  exotic  Qs  hear	the
       siren  call  of	the rutting R.	And so relations between Qs
       and Rs grow still more tense.
       ""It is our impression that, for both Rs and  Qs,	 archetypal
       Rs  the	'idols	of  the	 tribe.'  It is	the R whose natural
       masculine grace tops  the  overall  hierarchy  of  desirable
       traits	in  the	 fierce	 gay  competition  of  good  looks.
       Handsome	Rs often sense this pecking order, and feeds  their
       egos  while  hardening  their disdain for Qs, especially	the
       effeminate ones.	...
       ""Many Qs	may learn from necessity to refocus their libido on
       fellow Qs. ...
       ""For it is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after	the
       R  as  sexual object, they may also resent and reject him as
       social  companion!   There  are	several	 reasons  for  this
       rejections. 'Sour grapes' is an understandable reaction from
       those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
       have  defensively  fashioned  a	lifestyle  out	of peculiar
       individualism are bound to resent (and perhaps envy  just  a
       little)	those  gays  who can and do successfully conform to
       straight	standards. ...	There is more to  Q/R  estrangement
       than just these problems.
       ""For one	thing, if the handsome all-American straight boy is
       the  ultimate  sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-
       type homosexual must appear as a	ghostly	mock-up	of the real
       thing. ...
       ""Further, Rs are	 still	more  upsetting	 to  those  Qs	who
       believe	that  'butch'  behavior	is just	an unnatural put-on
       for gays. ...  Just as the anti-conformity of Qs	baffles	Rs,
       the ease	with which Rs conform to the mainstream	may be hard
       for Qs to understand. ...  Hence, Qs  may  misinterpret	the
       Rs' ingrained disinclination to gayified	behavior, and label
       it homophobia. ...
       ""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type  persona
       as the 'true' gay type, and hence feel like outsiders within
       their own outgroup. ...
       ""How do these tensions between Rs and Qs	affect	the  social
       structures,  political institutions, and	activist success of
       the gay community?  ...	 Those	who  could  not	 hide  have
       instead	turned	to make	their stand against oppression,	and
       Qs have risen to	political leadership and brotherhood in	the
       activist	 movement across America.  This	is to their credit.
       Extreme Qs, as a	group, may rate	below Rs on the	sociosexual
       hierarchy,  but they can	and do rank above them on the scale
       of political power in the gay world.
       ""In  the	 meantime,  reticent  Rs,  who	benefit	 from	the
       sacrifices  of  Qs and yet carp about their flamboyant image
       in the straight world, have been	able to	have it	both  ways:
       they  achieve  personal	acceptability in the right straight
       world of	today, while relishing the progress  toward  social
       flexibility  made on their behalf for tomorrow.	But because
       Rs do not choose	to play	the activist game in great numbers,
       they  lose their	ability, as a group, to	influence the rules
       of that game.
       ""Although the point is hard  to	prove  with  certainty,	 we
       suspect that it is mainly Qs who	organize the gay community,
       set its norms, and decide which of  its	collective  efforts
       are  PC	['politically  correct'].  PC initiatives are those
       which the gay leadership	and press deem to be good  for	the
       gay  community  as  a whole.  And the mobilization of the R-
       type subgroup, it turns out,  is	 definitely  not  PC  -	 at
       least, not in Boston.  Let us give you an example.
       ""Several	years ago, a handful of	 young	men  in	 that  city
       attempted   to  start  an  organization	which  would  bring
       together	self-perceived	Rs  for	 social	 activities.   They
       posted  two  short announcements	in college and local papers
       with the	 headline,  'STRAIGHT  GAYS.'  The  leaders  rather
       crudely	hinted	that this new club would be for	those young
       gays 'not  entirely  comfortable	 with  the  glittering	bar
       crowd.'	One  of	 the  authors  attending the organization's
       first meeting.  He found	the room packed	 with  excited	and
       grateful	 Rs,  who immediately set about	the organization of
       the  club  activities  ranging  from  baseball	to   opera-
       listening.   The	only qualification for membership was self-
       selection according  to	the  understood	 character  of	the
       organization,  and  its	aims  remained	social	rather than
       political. ...  Within weeks, the club was regularly drawing
       to its meetings between one and two hundred members - making
       it one of the most active gay groups  in	 Boston.  ...	Its
       leaders likened the group to the	gay clubs designed to bring
       together	men with  other	 special  interests,  such  as	the
       black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite, or 'man/boy love'
       societies in town.
       ""Boston's  gay  leadership  did	not  buy  the	comparison,
       however.	  There	was evident suspicion and resentment (based
       some part, no doubt, on envy) at	the prospect  of  'student-
       aged'   all-American   Rs   cloistering	 exclusively  among
       themselves for social and sexual	companionship.	A local	gay
       newspaper  attacked  the	group openly for its supposed macho
       snobbery	and for	the 'closet cases' it  seemed  to  nurture.
       ...    The   organization's  leaders  protested	that  their
       intentions had been misunderstood  (although,  in  a  sense,
       they   have  been  all-to-clearly  understood  -	 and  found
       politically incorrect).	But eventually they  bowed  to	the
       pressure.   Over	 two  years  they  gradually phased out	the
       stress upon 'straight gays.'  The  criticism  from  the	gay
       community  stopped  coming.  Alas, so did the group's R-type
       members.	 Having	lost  its  distinctive	drawing	 card,	the
       entire  operation  fizzled.   It	 had  failed the test of PC
       administered by the Q-oriented community. ...
       ""And there is a final twist in the Q/R cold  war	 which	may
       impede  the  growth of gay rights from time to time.  R-type
       gays are	the ones who actually succeed in slipping into	the
       circles	of mainstream political	power in America.  So it is
       a sad irony that	confidential liaisons between uptight Rs in
       government  and	Qs heading the gay activist movement can be
       further	strained  by  the   R's	  basic	  alienation   form
       unconventional Qs in general. ...
       ""This  analysis	has  found  the	 gay  world  troubled	and
       handicapped by the mutual alienation of Qs and Rs.  It is PC
       to deny this split. ...	First, we must abandon PC myths	and
       admit  that  the	 split	exists.	 Second, we must understand
       clearly the root	cause of the Q/R cold  war.   Someone  once
       called  it  'oppression	sickness':  each outgroup member is
       ill-at-ease with	himself, and is	frustrated  by	his  forced
       companions,  because the	social mainstream imposes pressures
       and expectations	which he feels that  he	 cannot	 meet,	and
       because	his  companions	 remind	him of his own failure.	 So
       the more	progress we can	make toward  social  acceptance	 in
       the  straight world for gays as a whole,	the less tension we
       will see	between	groups within the gay world. ...
       ""In the meantime, the gay  community  should  recognize	the
       distinct	identity and special problems of R-type	homosexuals
       - and could begin by expanding the aegis	of PC tolerance	 to
       include R-type organizations.

two polar categories of gay men, based on how they were able to
conform in youth and how they accepted ""gayified"" behavior in adulthood.
Things don't seem that clear cut to me for several reasons:
The first reason is that I wouldn't know whether to classify myself as
a Q or R. On one hand, much of ""gayified"" behavior and style really
turns me off. Just as the authors say of R's, my reaction OFTEN
is ""Why would someone want to appear that way?"" On the other hand,
I don't shun the gay ghetto and, like Q's, I suspect that a gay man
who does so suffers from internalized homophobia. In my childhood,
I was an unathletic sissy. I could not conform, but unlike the author's
description of Q youths, I did not turn non-conformity into anti-conformity.
Instead I deeply wished I could conform.
The second reason is that I often meet ""gayified"" gay men who DID
conform in their youth. They were athletic, they joined a fraternity,
etc. And now as adults they conform within the gay ghetto. Because of
their conformity to some ""gayified"" style, if I had to classify them
as Q's or R's, I would chose Q's. They OFTEN aren't particularly
effeminate, but rather ""masculine"" clone types, who are on one of the
gay bar's softball teams in the gay softball league, who go out
to gay discos on the weekend (at least prior to the epidemic), and in
general, seem to keep their social life restricted pretty much to the
gay ghetto.
The third reason has to do with gay self-hatred. The authors say that R's
put a premium on straight appearance because they were
able to conform and reap the benefits of conformity during their youth.
The authors explain the R's dislike of gayified behavior as
inability to appreciate why Q's lean towards anti-conformity.
The authors claim that the Q's view this dislike as gay self-hatred,
and that the Q's are merely un-understanding of the R's premium on
conformity. I strongly disagree. There is quite a bit of ""R-like""
behavior that IS motivated by homophobia, although it would be
difficult to ascertain how much of this dislike of various
""gayified"" behavior comes from homophobia.
But on the other hand, a lot of what the authors say rings true.
I think that this is so because what they describe are not two
types of gay PERSONS, but rather two DYNAMICS IN OUR PERSONALITIES.
I see both the ""R"" dynamic and the ""Q"" dynamic at work in my own
personality, in my own style, and in the personalities and styles
of my gay male friends. Furthermore, most gay men I meet show quite
a mixture of these two dynamics. As for the way I ""categorize"" (or not)
myself, I do not think of myself as a gayified gay or as a ""straight""
gay, but as a Rob-Bernardo-gay (or as a just plain Rob-Bernardo). I often
feel very critical of gay men who have moved to San Francisco and
gotten too GHETTOIZED. They seem to have lost their individuality
in conforming to the gay ghetto. But that's another posting to net.motss.
So, what I think the authors missed is that conformity in youth
can lead to conformity to the gay ghetto in adulthood, and that
some dislike for gayified behavior is due to homophobia.","GilhGtHFa8wJ",23,1985-11-23,-11,10

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!
Why is this country so f*cking wierd these days?  No international body

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

""Amongst ourselves, we are fighting a cold war over rank and power  in	the
gay world, and the opposing sides are drawn in terms of	self-identification
and public appearance.	What is	worse, this  struggle  for  hierarchy  will
continue unless	we abandon some	of the dogmas of the gay establishment.	...
""The shared impressions	and arguments put forth	 here  are  tentative,	our
generalizations	 are  riddled  with exceptions,	and we imagine that some of
our speculations will be proved	incorrect.
""First,	consider two modes of self-perception. ...  Many gay  men  like	 to
identify themselves either as 'straight	gays' (R-types)	or not (Q-types).

""Rs like to think that they pass as straights on  the  street.	They  value
highly their acceptance	in general society, and	many are careful to sustain
friendships in the  straight  community.   Rs  are  proud  of  their  manly
appearance, and	typically rankle over the camp use of feminine pronouns	for
gay males.  They may be	receptive  to,	or  even  obsessive  about,  social
conventions   and  norms  based	 on  gender  distinction;  ...	 completely
homosexual Rs may persist in describing	themselves as 'bisexual.'
""The one thread	connecting the childhoods of Rs	we have	interviewed is _ p_ e_ e_ r
_ a_ c_ c_ e_ p_ t_ a_ b_ i_ l_ i_ t_ y.	 By and	large, Rs were kids who, for one reason	or another,
_ c_ o_ u_ l_ d conform with ease, and so	did. ...  Young	Rs,  it	 seems,	 were  only
dimly  aware  of  their	need for the rewards of	acceptability, effortlessly
achieved.  So the arrival of adolescent	sexuality  sent	 a  stunning  shock
through	 well-adjusted	Rs.  ...   Many	 boys  ignored	and  disguised this
discovery until	they could come	to terms with it.  In the meantime, teenage
Rs struggled even harder to preserve their acceptable outer image.  Even as
they grew up to	enjoy sex with other boys on the  sly,	conformism  in	all

""... these gays	often are not, and feel	 that  they  do	 not  wish  to	be,
'straight-acting  and appearing.' The extreme Q	is a homosexual	on display.
(He may	not always be one display ... [e.g.] in	the presence of	family	and
employers.)  On	 the  street,  he  may assume any one of the several public
personas most familiar to the straight world: the pomaded and permed 'fem',
the titanic leather master, the	clipped	clone, the _ G_ Q hyperboy,	and others.
...  Qs	are outwardly _ g_ a_ y_ i_ f_ i_ e_ d;	 they  have  bought  into  strict  outgroup
stereotypes  which,  whether  screaming	or ultramasculine in their details,
constitute a burlesque of gender roles.	 Qs think of themselves	as  visible
gays, and tend to make such a profile central to their ego structure. ...
""Outer eccentricity comes at a price, however,	and  Qs	 are  perhaps  more
likely	than  Rs  to  be  drawn	 toward	 the asylum of gay ghettos in urban
centers. ...
""Whereas Rs usually could conform [during childhood] and so  did,  many	 Qs
felt that, for whatever	reasons, they could not	conform	during their youth,
and so	did  not.   Those  reasons  might  include  passivity,	effeminacy,
homeliness,  remarkable	 prettiness,  lack of athletic skill, or almost	any
other cause for	unpopularity among male	youth.	At first,  evidently,  many
Qs  were unhappy loners	who salvaged their self-esteem by making a lodestar
virtue	out  of	 _ i_ n_ d_ i_ v_ i_ d_ u_ a_ l_ i_ s_ m	rather	than  peer  acceptance.	  But  non-
conformity engenders anti-conformism.  So some Qs went further and acquired
a taste	for outrageousness, actively calculating shock to others  in  order
to reinforce their social status as rebels with	a cause. ...
""As the	years go by, and they learn that  they	are  not  alone,  Qs  adopt
zealously  the	visible	 uniforms and credos of	their supporting outgroups.
...  Surveys have shown	that, for many Qs, camp	behavior is a passing phase
of overt defiance, toned down in later years.
""When those gays who boast R-status meet those who defend  Q-status,  there
can  be	 trouble.   First, let's look at things	for the	viewpoint of the R.
For one	thing, the sexual objects of Rs	are usually other Rs; Qs,  for	the
most  part  are	scorned. ...  It is the	'fem' [from among the variety of Q-
type personas] who bears the brunt of the invective from Rs. ...
""[Gay] bars are	often regarded by Rs as	the bastions of	self-segregated	 Qs
-  branded  as twinkie bars, leather bars, etc.	- and so may be	viewed with
distaste. ...
""We should mention at this point that those Rs who shun	the  bars  find	 it
more  difficult	 to lead satisfactory sex lives.  They have trouble meeting
other Rs because, unlike visible Qs, out in the	straight world most Rs have
banished  any  tell-tale  signals  of  homosexuality  from their conformist
uniforms and are wary of mistaken self-exposures. ...
""To make sexual	matters	still more difficult for many  Rs,  they  face	two
more  unique  dilemmas.	 ...  First, ... a Q may be drawn to, and satisfied
by, a relationship with	an acceptably masculine	R.  But	what of	the classic
R-type	-  the 'all-American boy' whose	only felt shortcoming is his sexual
preference?  For him, the perfect '10' - the sexual object  possessing	the
one  feature he	feels he lacks and wishes to capture - may very	well be	the
straight boy, who is, by definition, unattainable. ...
""The second sexual dilemma faced by Rs	involves  the  ritual  of  sex-play
itself.	  For at least some Rs,	it seems, masculine _ r_ o_ l_ e _ p_ e_ r_ f_ o_ r_ m_ a_ n_ c_ e is	the
most thrilling part of sexplay,	yet it is easily threatened  in	 homosexual
practices such as passive anal sex or active fellatio. ...
""But even if the R is contentedly 'out'	to family and  friends,	 and  self-
exposure is not	an issue, he may still dislike Qs for two related reasons.
""First,	because	the R has typically conformed with ease	to the	mainstream,
the  exaggerated  outgroup displays of Qs simply _ b_ a_ f_ f_ l_ e	him.  Why would	any
person _ c_ h_ o_ o_ s_ e to draw such public ridicule and abuse, he wonders?  ...	 'I
don't  see why they have to play-act at	bikers or movie	queens,' said one R
[we interviewed].  'It obviously looks phony and fools no  one.'  At  best,
then,  many Rs come to view Qs the way that many straights view	homosexuals
_ e_ n _ b_ l_ o_ c, as somehow foolish and	trivial, a nationality of sterile  cuckoos.
...
""Second, Qs do more than baffle	Rs - they also _ i_ r_ r_ i_ t_ a_ t_ e	Rs terribly,  to  a
degree	that  more  detached  straights	cannot understand.  Many Rs plainly
resent being identified	with the Qs, and blame them for	the  weird  profile
of homosexuals as a whole. ...
""Like most gay males, it seems,	even exotic Qs hear the	siren call  of	the
rutting	R.  And	so relations between Qs	and Rs grow still more tense.
""It is our impression that, for	_ b_ o_ t_ h Rs	and Qs,	archetypal Rs the 'idols of
the  tribe.'  It  is  the  R whose natural masculine grace tops	the overall
hierarchy of desirable traits in the fierce gay	competition of good  looks.
Handsome  Rs  often  sense  this  pecking order, and feeds their egos while
hardening their	disdain	for Qs,	especially the effeminate ones.	...
""Many Qs may learn from	necessity to refocus their libido on fellow Qs.	...
""For it	is an awful irony that even as may Qs lust after the  R	 as  sexual
object,	they may also resent and reject	him as social companion!  There	are
several	reasons	for this rejections. 'Sour  grapes'  is	 an  understandable
reaction  from those Qs	who have themselves been spurned by Rs.	 And Qs	who
have defensively fashioned a lifestyle out of  peculiar	 individualism	are
bound  to resent (and perhaps envy just	a little) those	gays who can and do
successfully conform to	straight standards.  ...   There  is  more  to	Q/R
estrangement than just these problems.
""For one thing,	if the handsome	all-American straight boy is  the  ultimate
sexual ideal for most gays, then to Qs the R-type homosexual must appear as
a ghostly mock-up of the real thing. ...
""Further, Rs are still more upsetting to those Qs who believe that  'butch'
behavior  is  just  an	unnatural  put-on  for gays. ...  Just as the anti-
conformity of Qs baffles  Rs,  the  ease  with	which  Rs  conform  to	the
mainstream   may  be  hard  for	 Qs  to	 understand.  ...   Hence,  Qs	may
misinterpret the Rs' ingrained disinclination  to  gayified  behavior,	and
label it homophobia. ...
""Rs themselves come to accept one or another Q-type persona as	the  'true'
gay type, and hence feel like outsiders	within their own outgroup. ...
""How do	these tensions between Rs and  Qs  affect  the	social	structures,
political  institutions,  and  activist	 success  of the gay community?	...
Those who could	not hide have instead turned to	make  their  stand  against
oppression,  and  Qs  have risen to political leadership and brotherhood in
the activist movement across America.  This is to  their  credit.   Extreme
Qs,  as	 a  group, may rate below Rs on	the sociosexual	hierarchy, but they
can and	do rank	above them on the scale	 of  _ p_ o_ l_ i_ t_ i_ c_ a_ l	power  in  the	gay
world.
""In the	meantime, reticent Rs, who benefit from	the sacrifices	of  Qs	and
yet carp about their flamboyant	image in the straight world, have been able
to have	it both	ways: they achieve  personal  acceptability  in	 the  right
straight  world	 of  today,  while  relishing  the  progress  toward social
flexibility made on their behalf for  tomorrow.	  But  because	Rs  do	not
choose to play the activist game in great numbers, they	lose their ability,
as a group, to influence the rules of that game.
""Although the point is hard to prove with certainty, we	suspect	that it	 is
mainly	Qs  who	organize the gay community, set	its norms, and decide which
of its collective efforts are PC ['politically correct'].   PC	initiatives
are  those  which  the gay leadership and press	deem to	be good	for the	gay
community as a whole.  And the mobilization  of	 the  R-type  subgroup,	 it
turns out, is definitely _ n_ o_ t PC	- at least, not	in Boston.  Let	us give	you
an example.
""Several years ago, a handful of young men in that city	attempted to  start
an  organization  which	 would	bring together self-perceived Rs for social
activities.  They posted two  short  announcements  in	college	 and  local
papers	with  the  headline,  'STRAIGHT	 GAYS.'	 The leaders rather crudely
hinted that this new club would	be  for	 those	young  gays  'not  entirely
comfortable  with  the	glittering bar crowd.' One of the authors attending
the organization's first meeting.  He found the	room  packed  with  excited
and  grateful  Rs,  who	 immediately set about the organization	of the club
activities  ranging   from   baseball	to   opera-listening.	 The   only
qualification for membership was self-selection	according to the understood
character of the organization, and its aims  remained  social  rather  than
political.  ...	  Within  weeks,  the  club  was  regularly  drawing to	its
meetings between one and two hundred members - making it one  of  the  most
active	gay groups in Boston. ...  Its leaders likened the group to the	gay
clubs designed to bring	together men with other	special	interests, such	 as
the  black/white,  sadomasochist, transvestite,	or 'man/boy love' societies

""Boston's gay leadership did not buy the comparison,  however.	 There	was
evident	 suspicion  and	 resentment (based some	part, no doubt,	on envy) at
the prospect of	 'student-aged'	 all-American  Rs  cloistering	exclusively
among  themselves  for	social	and  sexual  companionship.   A	 local	gay
newspaper attacked the group openly for	its supposed macho snobbery and	for
the  'closet  cases'  it seemed	to nurture. ...	 The organization's leaders
protested that their intentions	had  been  misunderstood  (although,  in  a
sense,	they  have  been  all-to-clearly understood - and found	politically
incorrect).  But eventually they bowed to the  pressure.   Over	 two  years
they  gradually	 phased	 out the stress	upon 'straight gays.' The criticism
from the gay community stopped coming.	Alas, so  did  the  group's  R-type
members.   Having  lost	 its distinctive drawing card, the entire operation
fizzled.  It had failed	the test  of  PC  administered	by  the	 Q-oriented
community. ...
""And there is a	final twist in the Q/R cold war	which may impede the growth
of  gay	 rights	 from  time to time.  R-type gays are the ones who actually
succeed	in slipping into the  circles  of  mainstream  political  power	 in
America.   So  it is a sad irony that confidential liaisons between uptight
Rs in government and Qs	heading	the gay	activist movement  can	be  further
strained by the	R's basic alienation form unconventional Qs in general.	...
""This analysis has found the gay world	troubled  and  handicapped  by	the
mutual	alienation  of Qs and Rs.  It is PC to deny this split.	...  First,
we must	abandon	PC myths and admit that	the split exists.  Second, we  must
understand clearly the root cause of the Q/R cold war.	Someone	once called
it  'oppression	 sickness':   each  outgroup  member  is  ill-at-ease  with
himself,  and  is  frustrated  by his forced companions, because the social
mainstream imposes pressures and expectations which he feels that he cannot
meet,  and  because  his  companions remind him	of his own failure.  So	the
more progress we can make toward social	acceptance in  the  straight  world
for gays as a whole, the less tension we will see between groups _ w_ i_ t_ h_ i_ n	the
gay world. ...
""In the	meantime, the gay community should recognize the distinct  identity
and  special  problems of R-type homosexuals - and could begin by expanding
the aegis of PC	tolerance to include R-type organizations.
""At the	same time, the community must also burn	off the	chaff  of  its	own
implicit contempt for Qs of various hues.""

     The current Christopher Street has an article addressing
America's increasing conservatism (I, for one, think the media is
unwittingly increasing conservatism by focusing on ""yuppies"" and
""increasing conservatism"", but you can insert your own theory on the
cliche at this point and read on).  The main thrust seems twofold:
diminish the emotional reaction accompanying words like ""gay"" and
""homosexual"", and re-interpret the gay cause as one for universal
American principles: freedom to beleive what you want, to say what you
want, to do what you want as long as it doesn't conflict with other's
rights (needless to say, that doesn't include the right to not deal
with gay issues).  Straights might not defend your right to have
children, but they'll defend to their deaths the right for you to talk
about it-- at least in theory.  (For the record, children of
homosexuals are probabilistically Less likely to turn out homosexual--
too bad stats don't have much impact on the way people make
decisions).
     I, for one, am very glad to see a conservative movement within
the gay subculture.  Ok, partly I'm biased because I beleive in
economic conservativism (generally laissez faire), but partly it's
because I'm tired of Sister Boomboom representing the gay cause to
America's families.  
     PCness (Political Correctness) has rendered the gay movement
impotent.  By calling Robert's Rules of Order heterosexual societal
baggage, it has created meetings decaying to complete disorder.  About
six years ago, a congressional report asked for suggested revisions to
American sex education to incorporate the lessons of the gay cause.
No response from the gay community was ever given, partly because
side issues had equal priority: cross-dressing is ok, isn't it?  Sex
between people widely divergent in age is ok, isn't it?  
     Before you (perhaps otherwise justly) accuse me of the same
intolerant attitudes towards diversity that Jerry Falwell and the KKK
have, let me say that I beleive goodness is in the eyes of the
beholder, and that only acts which are clearly destructive should be
prohibited.  But at the same time let me claim that the reason I
realize this is because I am forever rubbing up against the walls
society has arbitrarily placed against what I want to do.  And let me
further claim that, having grown up in a small midwestern town, had I
not rubbed up against those restrictions I would (perhaps) be as
intolerant as the rest.
     For although I recognize it is wrong to restrict others' freedom
in the name of making my own world more ""perfect"" (taken to extreme,
the mentality shouts ""less Catholics, Jews, Blacks, homosexuals to
estrange my children-- everyone should be just like me""), I also claim
that the gains to be made in the 1980's do not stem from convincing
others that this is true.  The media resents broadcasting messages
like this during the Reagon admistration (what kind of a message would
that be during a conservative ""era""?).  
     The Gay cause must set specific goals, achievable one at a time,
which satisfy two conditions: a) the goal must be acheivable in the
current political climate, and b) the goal must be supported by a
large number of individuals willin to contribute to the cause.  Yes,
this might mean we must temporarily halt our struggle against
pornography censors in order to get the feminist cause back on our
side.  It might mean we must abandon our struggle to lower the age of
consent in some states in order to get wider support for the abolition
of sodomy laws.  But it might also mean step by step victories which
will form the basis of a further movement towards maximum freedom.  
     In the end, we must stop estranging the most wealthy gays in the
country who, up till now, have been reticent to donate money to a
cause plagued with the reputation of being slightly left of cummunism.
It is time to free ourselves of our extremest stereotyping, to let
people know who we, as gays and lesbians, truly are-- rather like
everyone else.

on-going  discussion  in  net.motss,  and in a follow-up, I agreed and
said I would post an article about personal issues in my life as a gay
man.  This is it.
After thinking,	I came up with three major personal issues  that  have
to do with my being a gay man on a daily basis.
   - feeling disenfranchised
   - AIDS
   - forming a home with someone
I feel incredibly vulnerable about what	I wrote	below,	but  what  the
hell.	I  feel	 most vulnerable in front of those people at work that
will read this but who I do not	know well  enough  to  talk  about  my
feelings with.
DISENFRANCHISEMENT
I  feel	 disenfranchised   as	a   result   of	  heterosexism.	   (By
'heterosexism'	I  mean	 an  unwitting	or  unconscious	 assumption on
someone's part that everyone  is  heterosexual	and  perhaps  leads  a
certain	type of	life, e.g.  marriage, family.)
The disenfranchisement	I  feel	 does  not  come  from	individuals  I
personally  deal  with,	 but  more  from  people at a distance or from
institutions.  For example, the	people at work who  I  talk  with  are
basically  not	heterosexist.	But the	words and actions of coworkers
who I do not interact with much, even professionally,  sometimes  make
me  feel  disenfranchised.   Just subtle things	in the way they	phrase
things sometimes.  Usually nothing so consciously anti-gay that, if  I
chose, I could challenge them about.
Nobody but me in our office openly gay that I  know  of.   No  one  to
REALLY	talk 'sisterly'	with.  There are a couple three	people at work
I can sort-of talk with	to in the way I	 would	only  normally	do  to
another	gay man, e.g. feeling comfortable enough to remark how nice it
is that	there are quite	a few construction workers around to  look  at
(the  building	is  half  unbuilt).   And  that	comfort	came only very
recently.
Sometimes I feel lonely.
AIDS
I don't	think there has	been a single day in the past year or so  that
I  have	 not thought about, worried about the threat of	AIDS.  The New
York Native (a NY-based	gay biweekly newspaper that is national	in its
scope of news) arrived today and a good	quarter	of its 60 odd pages is
about AIDS.
I will go to the gym tomorrow morning.	I will see  perhaps  a	little
bruise there or	a red mark here	and the	first thing that flashes in my
mind is	KS, even when I	KNOW that I ALWAYS get a little	 bruise	 there
from horseback riding, and that	I ALWAYS have had that little red mark
here ever since	I can remember.	 I will	effortlessly use the  exercise
cycle  for 20 minutes, but later in the	day when I return to my	office
from lunch and get a little winded going up three  flights  of	stairs
while  talking	at  the	same time, I wonder if it is pneumocystis.  On
Friday,	Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, will	come  out.   I
will  turn to the obituary column with morbid interest.	 There will be
half a dozen photos, mostly of gay men about my	age, some  of  whom  I
will recognize from the	neighborhood, from the gym, etc.  Infrequently
there will be someone I	knew  well,  a	person	I  once	 dated,	 or  a
roommate I once	shared an apartment with.
Do you think there's a chance Reagan will get AIDS from	the  blood  (I
presume) he got	during his polyp surgery?
Sometimes I feel terror.
HOME
I dream	of having a home life with another man on a gentleman's	 farm.
Something  small  but pretty.  A few animals - two horses, some	goats.
Something I think I could afford  with	another	 person	 of  the  same
means.
Another	gay man	who likes country living?  Another gay man  who	 likes
horses	(and  that's  not  just	 from  the  other  side	of the fence)?
Another	gay man	whose boots are	not just a part	of his	""cowboy	 drag""
when  he  goes out to the c/w bar on the weekend?  (And, god, he's got
to be intelligent, verbal, and introspective enough to get along  with
someone	 who  grew up in an upper middle class mainly Jewish suburb of
New York, who went to college for 10 years,  and  who  is  a  computer
programmer).
Sometimes I laugh!

I think this is a very common feeling among gay people, though how one
reacts to it depends on where it happens, how much you have learned to
artificially separate your personal life from your public persona, and how
sensitive you are to the kind of dissonance this produces.
It hasn't been a real problem for me where I work, except in one particular
instance which won't happen again: every year BBN holds a ""winter party"" at
a local museum with food, music and dancing, and last winter, the entire
company was invited.  Plans for my lover and I to meet up with other gay
and non-gay friends quickly vanished as I tried to find them among the
2000-odd people meandering around the six sprawling floors of the Science
Museum.  Lots of strangers, lots of people you wouldn't even want to talk
with even IF your lover weren't standing next to you, straight couples
EVERYWHERE, and my local support system nowhere to be found.  Aauuugggh.
After a few hours we left, suffocating from the thick cloud of
heterosexuality.  (I am sure I have just ""disenfranchised"" the straight
contingent here, but I'm telling it to you ""straight"", as it were.)

would be interested in the view point of a ""straight"" married female.  You
might be interested to know that we share some of the same views.  I have 
also been unhappy about the volume of postings to this net group.  What is
there tends to be of good content, but what struck me the most is I always
see the same names.  I am posting this via anonymous electronic mail for
two reasons.  I am new to the net and have just not learned how to post, and as
I am only working for the summer, it was not worth taking the time.  Also,
to be honest, I would hesitate to post to this news group because I would
not want anybody getting the wrong idea about me, even if I am married.  Of
course if anybody did, that would mean they also read this news group, right?
It will not be possible for me to receive any mail, as I am getting ready to
leave, but I probably still be reading the news group, so any public responses
(good or bad) are welcome.
	I am sure you wonder why I would be interested in your news group.
Some of you may think it is only a sordid curiosity.  I like to understand
what is happening around me.  The foreign friends I have had fascinate me
when they talk about their culture and beliefs.  In the same way your
culture fascinates me.  You live a life and emotions I do not understand, 
only because you are in a situation unlike any I have ever known.  The only 
close gay friends I have had were in high school, and still in the transition 
period where they had serious questions within themselves, so yours is a world 
completely unfamiliar to me.
	As for Ken Arndt, I know he attacks a very sensitive area with you,
but I really think it should not bother you.  In reading other news groups,
he is just as unpopular.  More than any other, he is openly insulted for his
view points.  Coming from anybody else, I can understand the agony it would
cause, but Ken is a sub-human life form with a pretense of human emotions.  I
was honestly surprised when he said he still loves you, and when are you going
to get together.  I would have been even more surprised if you had taken him
up on it, and would have assumed it was only to greet him in hostile numbers
with ulterior motives, but then that would be sinking to his level.
	One thing I would like to say, just as you might not like being
characterized as having a certain behaviour because you are gay, I too feel
slightly offended by the category you lump us in at times.  Remember, the
most hostile are probably also the most verbal.  Do you always have the best
of your group represent you?  On our campus the ""leader of the gays"" (self-
proclaimed, of course) was the local joke, and though I don't know this for
a fact, I suspect he only made things harder for some of the others.  It seemed
that every time he did not get what he wanted it was because he was discriminated
against for being gay.  This was believable the first time, but the fourth or
fifth time, the story got old.  Now, if I believed he truly represented all
gays on our campus, I would have come up with a pretty low opinion of them.
Instead, I chose to judge people on an individual basis.
	On the Jason on Bars article - I found it amusing.  It seemed to me
to be a cross between honesty and friendly humour.  It did not seem like the
article of a depressed resentful person taking his problems out on others.
I also learned something from it, as I have learned from all of the articles,
but I didn't take it as a verbatim narrative of a typical night at the bars.
It seemed the point was the emotions creating the actions, not a satire of
the gay whores.  The articles on the gay emotions have been much more interesting
than the rehashed stories on AIDS.  This is the only place I know that I can
find such honesty about the feelings and struggles of gay people.  Of course,
it would mean more if more people contributed.  I strongly encourage others
to take advantage of the anonymous postings.  It would also help if any body
who did chose some nick name, so multiple postings can be easily followed.
	Well, I know I have rambled on.  I hope this was taken in the positive
way it was intended.  If I have inadvertantly offended anybody, I apologize.
I am not aware of everything that is acceptable, ie - I didn't know 
homosexual was a derogatory term until reading this group, I always thought
the term gay was more insulting.

which got me thinking a bit about my everyday life, gay culture,
""gay emotions"", etc.  In a sense this is directed at the non-gay
readers of net.motss, though it's also an invitation for comments
from other gay people.
The issue of differences between gay and straight people is complicated and
multi-faceted, depending on the points you want to make and the method of
analysis you take.  I'm going to concentrate on what will seem almost
blatantly obvious and not worth mentioning to some, but subtlety often gets
lost in this discussion, so I'll forge ahead.  My thesis is, simply, that
there is no such thing as a ""gay emotion"" and that there are few
categorical emotional differences between straight or gay relationships.
This is no less true for committed couples, either cohabiting or married, a
form of relationship which is probably less affected by gay/straight
""cultural differences"" for the points I wish to make.  Right now I know a
*lot* of couples--my straight friends are all at that late 20's-early 30's
""marrying age"", and being in a long-term relationship myself, we've also
gained a lot of gay couples as friends.  I see the same joys, trials and
committment regardless of their sexual orientation.  You still have to take
out the garbage, still have to build a compatible living arrangement, still
can reflect on your partner sleeping next to you, still have to plan
together the life you both wish to live.  The emotions which bind a couple
together and which grow over time are identical in straight or gay
relationships.
I am not trying to dismiss the differences between straight and gay
relationships (which certainly are there: should make some interesting
followup discussion--hint, hint).  I *am* trying to emphasize the
commonality which comes, simply, from our shared humanity.

& street fair on Christopher Street took place under hot (80s) sunny
skies.  It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year,
& the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in
the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast
no gloom at all on the festivities).
All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast,
& farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large
Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band
(which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & 
large raucous following from Philadelphia.
One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless
prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible.
The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was
dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey
shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with
virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long
program of utterly predictable speechifying).
An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes:
researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think)
the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene 
had been expected.  This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many
as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for
example.  A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly
overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system.
The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and
even treatment of AIDS patients.  Is Craig Werner or any other netters
out there willing to post a detailed article?

Um, just to give my own two-cents, Larry, welcome to the net and
{mod,net}.motss, but as you might expect, this discussion is not
particularly new or novel to readers of net.motss, is not a central
purpose of net.motss, and has been successfully exorcised several
times before.  Right now it seems to be precariously contained to
net.religion.christian, where both sides of the discussion can
generate as much heat as they like.  Were I involved in such a

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

			PART SEVEN
[NYNative, 12/19/83-1/1/84, Randy Shilts, ""Memos Show Administration Falsi-
fied AIDS Funding Needs, pp. 18-19,64]
At the end of 1983, the real story behind the Reagan administration's AIDS
effort (or, rather, lack of one) finally came out after literally years of
criticisms & fears.  ""Most of the darkest suspicions that scientists & gay
activists had long voiced about the lack of commitment to AIDS research by
the Reagan administration were confirmed....A stark portrait of government
duplicity which was quietly accepted by AIDS researchers in the CDC emerges
....""
This information had to be obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request
by Congress & from a 33-page report issued by Weiss' HSGOH.  ""CDC fiercely
opposed"" the FIA request, & was FORCED to surrender the desired memoranda
when the CDC refusal was appealed & publication of some of the memos by
Weiss' HSGOH in their report seemed imminent.
The released information revealed:
1. ""Some of the same officials who assured Congress that the federal gov't
had all the AIDS money it needed were privately pleading for more funds
from budget officials.""  CDC AIDS Task Force coord. Dr. James Curran notably
indulged in this form of prevarication, almost constantly claiming he had
or would soon receive funds that he knew didn't even exist!
2. ""Within 5 months of its formation, the CDC's AIDS Task Force (ATF) was
vainly begging the agency management for more funds & shortages have seri-
ously retarded the CDC's efforts throughout the AIDS epidemic.""
3. ""Much of the money that the CDC did spend on AIDS was diverted from
other important health needs.""
4. ""The failure to expediate funds for AIDS research meant that no
significant outlay of funds reached researchers until March 1983--
almost two years after AIDS was first detected.""
5. ""Serious misunderstandings about which federal agencies would handle
various aspects of the AIDS epidemic also seriously delayed research.""
CDC has received a ""good press"" from the media (excluding the gay press
which knew better, & was virtually alone in being critical & following
events closely), yet all during this period (1981-3) it was in fact
starved for funds.
Here's a closer history of events as revealed in internal HHS memos:
As early as June 1981 the CDC knew that AIDS was a serious epidemic:
they'd assigned staffers to it from its VD project.  By December
""when the number of cases had soared"", they were aware of the
magnitude of the task.  But they severely lacked funds.  Curran sub-
mitted a 6-months budget for a piddling $833,300.  But HHS did not
respond.  AT ALL.  Finally, Congress allocated $500,000 in August,
8 months late.  REAGAN VETOED THE APPROPRIATION.
Congress overturned the veto, & Curran finally received the money in
September.  By that time, the number of cases had quintupled.
Funding for 1983 ""fared little better"".  Administration budget cutters 
forced CDC to recalculate its budget THREE TIMES, the final AIDS figure
being 60% below the original one.  CDC Aids Task Force director Dr.
William Rushing included the following with his budget proposal:  ""As
you know, the attached budget is insufficient to adequately fund AIDS
surveillance & epidemiologic studies.  However, we will continue with\the
highest priority activities until additional funds become available.""
Finally Congress alllocated $2 million more for the CDC in December 1982;
""like other money that Congress would later appropriate, however, the
AIDS funding came in spite of the statements of federal health officials,
not because of them.""
In August 1982 the CDC wanted to set up a national AIDS surveillance
system, but had no money for it.  For the next 18 months, CDC ""depended
on doctors & health officials to call them up & tell them about AIDS
cases..."", an absurd situation for a federal health agency to be in
during a national epidemic.
""We lost all that data -- two years of cases are now irretrievable. All
that time I was saying we should do the work & Curran was telling us he
didn't have the money,"" said Dr. David Ostrow, an AIDS researcher at
Northwestern.
Researchers weho do get funds got inadequate ones:  SF's Dr. Andrew Moss
received $30,000 to monitor AIDS epidemiology for the CDC.  ""They give
you $30,000 -- it;s such an interesting sum.  It's too much to turn down,
but not enough to do anything meaningful.  It's similar to everything
about AIDS.""
The CDC AIDS Tsk Force's major piece of work, a case control study, was
published 18 months after it was finished;  epidemiologists criticized
its findings as ""sorely out of date"".
The Reagan administration's AIDS effort continued to be ""malnourished,
slipsod, disorganized, & bogged down by cumbersome bureaucracy"" in
1983.  By May, Brandt was alarmed & wrote to the HHS asst. sec. for
mamangement & budget:  ""It has now reached the point where important
AIDS work cannot be undertaken because of the lack of available re-
sources.""  Then CDC director Dr. William Foege added a long list of
projects ""postponed, delayed, or seriously curtailed"" because ""money
was diverted to AIDS.  These included studies on hepatitis, influ-
enza among the elderly, & rabies.""
""Just two weeks later, however, Thomas Donelly, who is in charge of
budgets at HHS, wrote a senate staffer that `we are not in favor of
additional appropriations' for AIDS research.""
""Brandt, Foege, & other health officials were also testifying before
Congress that they had enough funds for AIDS even while they were
privately begging for more money.""
In late May the House was about to pass an appropriation of an extra
$12 million for AIDS; at this time Brandt wrote ""that while the HHS
was not requesting more funds, they would `not oppose' having the
authority to transfer $12 million from other parts of the budget
into AIDS""!!
In September, HSGOH decided to add $22 million to the administration's
$17 million request (""only a 20 % increase over the previous year's
budget levels"").  HSGOH ""staffers think Republican committee members
leaked word to the administration because days later, Margaret Heckler.
secretary of HHS, made a highly-publicized announcement that the adminis-
tration would commit $40 million to AIDS research next year.  Heckler's
announcement did not mention thatthis allocation was a FAIT ACCOMPLI
because of the secret House vote--and it did not mention that even the
$40 million was $10 million BELOW whatthe CDC requested for AIDS research.""
""`Normally when you have an epidemic, the health people are begging you
for money', fumed Congresswoman Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, who co-
sponsored legislation for more AIDS funding.  `Here we were begging them
for information on what they needed & they kept telling us that they didn't
need any money.  It was unbelievable.'""
""In Washington, Dr. Edward Brandt, the administration's top health official,
brushed aside suggestions that he had been dishonest about the federal AIDS
effort.  He didn't need to ask for money, he insisted, because Congress
gave it to him anyway.
`By the time I put in a request & it goes through all the processes,
Congress passes the money [indeed!],' Brandt told the Native.  `It's
difficult to ever say you have enough money.  In one sense, as long as
you have the disease, you could say we don't have enough money.  All I
can say is that the money is there now.'""
""Though most scientists agree that the long-delayed money is now coming
from the federal government, some think that the government has irretriev-
ably lost its credibility with the scientific community.""
""Weiss' report requests that the gov't institute policies to expedite
funding of research grants &, most significantly, establish an independent
[of CDC, HHS] commission to map an overall strategy to fight AIDS.... The
budget would THEN BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO CONGRESS, CIRCUMVENTING THE
REAGAN BUDGET SLASHERS [my italics].  The panel itself implicitly reflects
the most serious charge within just about every paragraph of [HSGOH's]
report: the Reagan administration has been lying through its teeth about
the adequacy of AIDS funding for 2 years.""
There is much more information & events described in Shilts' article.
But the hour grows late, & my fingers are getting tired.
As some kind of a bench mark to make sense of the dollar amounts mentioned
above, a while ago HHS asked for funds merely to develop a few tests for
animal experiments preparatory to the real bulk of research; they asked for
at least $197 million.  Also remember that Congressional appropriations
amounts are limited by a factor the administration isn't:  the constant
obstacle of a Reagan veto.
[Gay Community News, 10/27/84, Jim Ryan, ""Health Director Resigns"", p. 1]
Ass't Sec. of HHS Dr. Edward Brandt, the nation's top physician, resigns
at the end of this year.  For all his shortcomings in performance & his
prevaricating, Brandt is a competent professional who showed a willingness
to work with gay organizations and was free of political ideology, if not
influence.
""The direction & extent of the gov't's research [on AIDS] depends in no
small measure on who is appointed to replace Brandt.... Any decision on
a successor will emanate from the Oval Office.""  That is, on tomorrow's
election result.
""Many fear"" Reagan will nominate C. Everett Koop, currently Surgeon Gene-
ral.  He's been ""widely criticized for his opposition to abortion, for
making numerous homophobic remarks, & for close ties to fundamentalist
Christian organizations.
Brandt was given credit for obtaining more AIDS funds at one point:  he
leaked a letter he wrote to his boss, Margaret Heckler, forcing Heckler's
hand.  Apparently Brandt thought there was good reason to believe Heckler
would deny or (more probably) ignore his request for more funds.  Heckler
had previously sat on an urgent AIDS funds request for six months doing
nothing; in that period of time, 500 more people had died of AIDS.

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

ting tired of asking this rather rhetorical question, but the
myopia on this net is just unbelievable!)
SOME of the complaints against belligerent f*ckups like Arndt & Brunson 
are that they're bigoted, insulting, exhibitionistic in really loathsome
ways (like, for example, street psychotics), filled with hatred and
self-hatred, etc. etc.  And this adds up to merely ""rude""?  Is it
merely ""rude"" to call a group of blacks ""filthy niggers"" who ought
to be ""hung from the nearest available tree"" AND then launch into,
say, ""rational"" discussion of race relations and the legislative
agenda before Congress?  And then swerve into a polemic denouncing
funding for sickle cell anemia (""Let 'em die!  We'll finally have
social peace!""), and discourse repetitively & at great length about
the genetic disposition of black men to commit rape (of white women,
that is)?
""Unsupportive"", ""unintelligible"", & ""rude"".   Are we even speaking
the same language (English, that is)?  Sometimes I really wonder.
No one would make coherence or ""supportiveness"" (whatever that term
means) a criterion for posting messages on this net, considering the
character of much net mail.
A newsgroup moderator won't function to ""translate"" rant into
a kind of rational filtrate: the whole point about the Arndt

are totally unacceptable.  NO exchange will occur unless parti-
cipants observe MINIMUM standards of civility & respect for each
other.  And indulging, revelling in, something as vile as blatant
and uninhibited bigotry on the net simply won't be tolerated, at
least not in this newsgroup. 
Here's a suggestion for assigning ""penances"" to offenders who ""repent""
(fat chance!):  ban them from publication or even summarizing in
mod.motss for as long a period as they've been ""sinning"", in the case
of Arndt, one whole year (so Ken can't expect to rejoin the fray until
November 1985).  Of course, for Arndts & Brunsons it would be entirely
just to ban them permanently, & I don't mean to argue against this

apologists for Arndt's behavior.  We are discussing, not ""supportiveness""
(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability to
treat a discussion and its members seriously.  Right now, there is
only one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.
Let's get one thing clear here.  If he acted this way in any other
newsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank.  If he behaved in
public similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged off
for psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.
Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groups
on USENET?  They are not.  
Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked to
clean up his act.  For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personal
troubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.  
I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffett
and any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to this
discussion a little late.  When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,
other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously.  We come
to this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduring
his tiresome anti-social behavior.  The readers and contributors to net.motss
could not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.
Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the real
world"", they are discussion groups.  It is an appalling, ignorant charge
that gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simply
because the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issues
seriously in an environment free of hecklers.  First, only some of the
members of net.motss are gay.  Second, it is only by such apologists that
infernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue.  It is only through
such apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is now
irrelevant to serious discourse.  It is right and responsible to expect
a certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it is
right and responsible to have standards of public behavior.  By no stretch
of the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fit
any such standard.  By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children to
scream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when a
series of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture.  Hey, that's the real
world, right?
Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative of
any movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.
And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and not
content.  Anyone willing to exercise some intellectual responsibility
for their comments are welcome, and will be taken seriously.

From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct 10, 1984.
In a prepared statement on Tuesday, San Francisco public health director
Mervyn Silveman said ""These businesses (gay bathhouses) have been
inspected on a number of occasions and demonstrate a blatant disregard for
the health of their patrons and of the community.
	""Make no mistake about it. These 14 establishments are not
fostering gay liberation. They are fostering disease and death.""
	He then ordered the commercial sex establishments closed.
Silverman had threatened to close the bathhouses and other commercial
sex establishments last March, but instead ordered a ban on sex in such
establishments in the city. Silverman said his decision (to close the
bathhouses) was reached because ""we now have solid evidence that AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease - often spread by people who are unaware that
they are carrying the virus. The virus, he said, has been found in 40 to 50
percent of the gay male population in San Francisco.

Aren't you ""utterly opposed""?  Christ preached that intent to do evil 
is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it.  
Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on.
As a Christian, do you not possess this belief?  After all, what can
you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?)
or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)?
Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public
cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to
sex?  But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""!
So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED?
> I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject.
But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other,
your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo-
phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser
Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or
Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd
wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could
be persuaded that gays can be chaste).
> On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity.
> In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies.
If the issue is promiscuity:  chastity is neither the logical opposite
nor the only alternative to promiscuity!  Nonpromiscuity (sexual com-
mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is.  This logical
goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more
example of how prejudice impairs judgment.
> The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],....
Then how can you give such extreme advice?  Christ's teaching emphasizes
purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and
relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes
minutely regulating external conduct.

That's commendable on your part.  But presumably you'd offer them the

Sour grapes here?  You should abstain from telling people to abstain

haven't seen anything quite like this before.  What mailing lists is he
on anyway?
Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rights
very early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for total
self-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this was
not limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referred
to) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them.  I
don't think there's much more to be said here.
All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly try
to dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA.  The key to
remember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and the
only groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and the
members of such groups themselves.  Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerpts
from pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of both
female and male children: where are the gay issues here?  Why did Arndt not
take this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,
where he could take the straight community to task for their own shameful
members?  Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.
One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.
Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to
""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,
""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""
Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gay
community (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gay
community.)  Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very small
minority supports the aims of such groups, with most people either
against or indifferent.
One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS and
promiscuity haven't received a response.  Nope, they haven't, and it's no
wonder.  Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, but
unfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority of
net.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior.  It's actually pretty
hilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needs
to do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guise
of martyr.  Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, and
by my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlier
behavior.  We'll see.

Actually, I doubt the insurance companies would go for this.  It only solves
half of the issue (if it even does that).  Suppose, that I (with my seatbelt
discount) go out driving with me belt on and run into (my fault) someone else
who is not wearing their seatbelt.  My policy is still obliged to pay.

No offense intended, but this is just the kind of thing that makes lawyers
have unassisted orgasms, makes judges commit suicide, makes insurance
company execs give smug little I'll-get-that-extra-Mercedes-this-year-
after-all smiles, and makes your average Joe's wallet look like an
Ethiopian famine victim.
Who is to decide that an accident could have been prevented by wearing a
seatbelt?  If the insurance company doesn't want to pay the injured all
they have to do is start too long, too expensive court battle to wear
the injured, the courts, and the rest of us down.  This area is far too
subjective and nebulous to be put into an arena where it can cause so
much grief.
My solution to seatbelt, helmet, anti-suicide, and other such 'preventative'
laws is simple:  get rid of them.  You're going to tell me that I can't
take a risk that endangers no one but me?  You're going to tell me that
I can't kill myself if I want to?  Rubbish!
By the way, the You in ""You're going to tell me...."" above is not
directed at Peter, just at legislators in general.
They let people hang-glide and water-ski without helmets, don't they?

An interesting viewpoint, and I can see your point somewhat, but:
a) You live in New York City (I know you don't, but pretend); there is
   a higher crime rate there, and when you get mugged your insurance
   company pays and I pay your insurance company.  I could give a lot
   more examples, but the basic line is that life (and ESPECIALLY
   insurance) ain't fair.  If you're interested in such things,
   definitely take the time to read _The_Invisible_Bankers_ by
   Andrew Tobias.
b) You hang glide and fly small planes, so you get injured and/or
   killed.  I pay.  Life is a bitch, ain't it?
My basic message here is much more objective than that:  There are
insurance discounts for non-smokers for the reasons that you put
forth above, and I like that because I am a non-smoker.  Am I really
a non-smoker?  Send me to your insurance company's doctor and I
guarantee you he can answer that question reliably unless I work
in a coal mine or in downtown L.A.  Now, do I really wear my
seatbelt all the time?  Who knows but me?

I owe you?  OK, I guess you're right -- I'll do my good deed by
reducing the population, not contributing to the rise in population
at a later date, not consuming anymore food, energy, or space; and
I'll lower the unemployment rate at the same time -- all by suicide!!
Pretty effective little act, isn't it?
As for your earlier point about you paying for this and that, what
about the jobs that I create in the insurance, health care, and
burial industries?  Not to mention the work afforded to florists (assuming
someone likes me enough to send flowers to either the hospital and/or
the funeral), the minister who reads my eulogy, the lawyers who squabble
over my estate, the coroner who does the autopsy... I could go on for
days!!
I think I'll go off myself right now; what a great feeling to be
benefiting others!!

I believe that if a seat belt user is involved in an accident, the selt
belt will stretch enough that investigators can easily tell the selt belt
has been through an accident.
I wouldn't expect any legislator to understand this, however.

From experience, I can testify that this is true. It's surprising the kind of
evidence that a trained investigator can find. 
I had an accident where I was rear-ended by a car massing more than twice
mine, traveling about 35-50 MPH upon impact. I had my left-turn signal going
(and my brakes on -OUCH!-), which was verified by the particular way the
remnants of the bulb's filaments deposited themselves upon the remnants of
the bulb!
Anyway, why couldn't the insurance company simply nullify the policy if
the owner of the policy sustained injuries that wouldn't occur if he had
been wearing his belt? (I know, this merely narrows the margin where it
is questionable, yet it becomes pretty small.) I dislike paying higher
premiums because other people don't wear their belts.

If the accident wasn't severe enough to stretch the seat belts,
then the medical damages ought to be very low.
If litigant's face is broken from hitting the windshield, even a jury is
unlikely to believe the seat belt was actually used. (where seat belt
means combination lap/shoulder belt)

In some states you are.  California used to be one, but I'm not sure if  it
still  is.  The  concept  involved  is  ""contributory negligence"".  If they
weren't wearing a seatbelt then their injuries are at  least  partly  their

I've fallen into this class.  It's a grey area as to what is harassing,
but it is almost certain that if someone tells you that you are harassing
them, and you continue to do it, that you are harassing them.

I don't think very many people are fooled.  After all,
if you really wanted to get to know someone, why go to a place
which is:
	A)  Too loud to talk.
	B)  Too dark to see.
	C)  Too smokey to smell.
	D)  Too progressive for touch (Lawrence Welk style) dancing.
There is no such thing as instant intimacy.  Sex is no substitute.
On the other hand, it sure makes being lonely a lot more fun.

The Sexual Revolution is over.  We lost.  Herpes and AIDS won.
