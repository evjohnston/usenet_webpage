        <h1>Python Script Guide</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This page provides a guide to the <a href="https://github.com/evjohnston/usenetscraping_public" target="_blank">python scripts</a> I developed for scraping and analyzing Usenet data from the Google Groups archive. I chose the Google Groups archive because it offers a comprehensive and accessible repository of historical Usenet content, making it an ideal resource for examining how early online communities engaged in discussions. The scripts allow users to extract detailed data on thread titles, comments, and metadata, enabling in-depth analysis of conversations within a newsgroup.</p>

        <h2>Why Google Groups?</h2>
        <p>Google Groups serves as a centralized platform that preserves extensive Usenet archives in a consistent format, making it easier to access and analyze compared to other archives. Its structured data allows for systematic scraping, which is crucial for large-scale research projects. By using Google Groups, we can tap into a rich dataset of Usenet discussions spanning decades, offering valuable insights into the early days of online communication.</p>

        <h2>Whatâ€™s Available in the Scripts?</h2>
        <p>The following Python scripts are designed to be used together for a comprehensive data collection process:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong><code>thread_scraper.py</code></strong> This script is designed to gather thread titles and metadata from a specified Usenet newsgroup on Google Groups. It collects key information such as thread titles, creation dates, authors, and the number of replies. This provides an overview of the newsgroup's activity, helping to identify key discussions and topics.</li>
            <li><strong><code>comment_scraper.py</code></strong> Building on the output of <strong>thread_scraper.py</strong>, this script scrapes all comments and their metadata from each thread listed. It extracts details such as the comment text, author, timestamp, and any additional metadata, allowing for a deeper analysis of the conversation dynamics within each thread.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By running these scripts sequentially, you can extract a complete dataset from a newsgroup, from thread-level summaries to detailed comment-level data.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">How to Run the Scripts</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Set Up Your Environment</h3>
            <p>Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed on your system. Install the necessary libraries using pip:</p>
            <code>
                pip install -r requirements.txt
            </code>
            <p>Download the scripts <strong>thread_scraper.py</strong> and <strong>comment_scraper.py</strong> to your preferred working directory.</p>

            <h3>Run <code>thread_scraper.py</code></h3>
            <p>Open the script in a text editor and specify the URL of the Usenet newsgroup you want to scrape. Execute the script using your command line or Python IDE:</p>
            <code>python thread_scraper.py</code>
            <p>This script will output a CSV file with thread titles and metadata.</p>

            <h3>Run <code>comment_scraper.py</code></h3>
            <p>Use the CSV output from <strong>thread_scraper.py</strong> as input for this script. Edit the script to reference the CSV file location. Run the script:</p>
            <code>python comment_scraper.py</code>
            <p>The result will be a CSV file containing all comments and associated metadata from each thread in the specified newsgroup.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Application of Scripts in My Research</h2>
        <p>My research focuses on Usenet before the Great Renaming, specifically targeting some of the most popular newsgroups as identified in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/net.news.group/c/IrWQzuYC5OY/m/PEc6cAjtXwwJ" target="_blank">Usenet Readership Summary Report for September 1986</a>. I have concentrated on the newsgroups <strong>net.motss, net.singles, net.politics, net.religion, net.news,</strong> and <strong>net.med</strong> because they are particularly relevant to my research on AIDS discussions and related social issues.</p>
        
        <p>Using these scripts, I have extracted extensive data from these groups, which has enabled a detailed examination of the early discussions on AIDS and homosexuality. For my project, I've performed additional cleaning to filter out threads that don't discuss AIDS or homosexuality. However, for this webpage, I chose to omit keyword filtering to provide a more comprehensive overview of early Usenet discussions, which I believe will be valuable to a broader audience interested in this historical period.</p>
        
        <p>Below is a table of descriptive statistics for the data collected from these newsgroups:</p>

        <p>On the next page, you will find an overview of what the data from these collected groups reveal, providing insights into the content and dynamics of early online discourse.</p>
