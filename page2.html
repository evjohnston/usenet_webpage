        <h2>Introduction to Usenet<sup>[1]</sup></h2>
        <p>Usenet, short for "Users Network," is a decentralized online communication system that predates the modern internet. It was founded in 1979 by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis at Duke University and was initially conceived as a means for academic institutions to share information and communicate across long distances. Unlike the contemporary World Wide Web, the platform functioned as a distributed network of servers where users could post messages in various newsgroups, each dedicated to a specific topic of discussion. You can think of these newsgroups as the precursor to modern-day forums or social media channels, organized by subject matter, and were open to anyone with access to the network.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        
        <p>Usenet's structure is inherently democratic and open, allowing for a free exchange of ideas without centralized control, and enabling the emergence of a vibrant, diverse community where discussions ranged from highly technical topics in computing to broader social, political, and cultural issues. Due to its origins, in its early years, Usenet was predominantly used by academics, engineers, and computer enthusiasts, but it quickly expanded to include a wider audience.</p>
        
        <h2>Overview of Usenet’s Development</h2>
        <p>To understand Usenet’s evolution, it's helpful to look at its history in distinct phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Early Years (1979 to Mid-1980s):</strong> During its initial phase, Usenet was characterized by a loosely organized collection of newsgroups created as needed by users. This period was marked by organic growth and a lack of standardized naming conventions or formal structure. As the user base expanded, newsgroups emerged around a variety of topics, leading to a vibrant but somewhat chaotic network.</li>
            <li><strong>The Great Renaming (1987):</strong> As Usenet grew, the need for a more structured organization became apparent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Renaming" target="_blank">The Great Renaming</a> was a significant reorganization in 1987 that aimed to streamline and standardize the categorization of newsgroups. This effort introduced a hierarchical structure, grouping newsgroups into broad categories such as "comp.*" for computers, "sci.*" for science, and "rec.*" for recreation, which helped to reduce confusion and improve the usability of the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion and Mainstream Use (1990s):</strong> Following the Great Renaming, Usenet continued to expand throughout the 1990s, becoming more accessible to the general public. The introduction of commercial internet service providers (ISPs) brought new users to the platform, leading to a significant increase in both the volume of discussions and the diversity of topics. However, this period also saw the rise of spam and other forms of unwanted content, which posed new challenges for the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Usenet Today:</strong> In the present day, Usenet remains active but has largely been overshadowed by modern internet forums, social media platforms, and other forms of digital communication. Nonetheless, it retains a dedicated user base and continues to serve as a valuable resource for accessing historical discussions and niche communities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Focus of My Project</h2>
        <p>My thesis focuses on Usenet in the early 1980s, before the Great Renaming, a critical period that aligns with the onset of the AIDS epidemic and during which Usenet was one of the few digital spaces where people could openly discuss the emerging health crisis. The network's less fragmented structure before the Great Renaming meant discussions on significant topics, like AIDS, were centralized within broader newsgroups, capturing a diverse range of voices and perspectives, and I believe analyzing these early conversations is critical. Not only can they reveal how the AIDS crisis influenced public discourse, but they can also, through a comparison with offline conversations and discourses, help illuminate the role of the early internet in reshaping public engagement, fostering community support, and challenging prevailing narratives around the epidemic.</p>
        
        <p>While my research is primarily qualitative and archival, focusing on the content and context of early Usenet discussions, I have also been leveraging bulk Usenet data to conduct network science analyses, which is what this website is meant to help showcase. In doing this, I’ve been trying to identify patterns in how discussions around AIDS and other significant topics spread and evolved across the network during the early 1980s. I’ve also been able to learn more about influence and authorship through this work, identifying key users who shaped the discourse and tracking how their contributions affected the flow and focus of conversations.</p>
        
        <p>While network analysis is not the sole focus of my project, the following pages on this site are designed to highlight the quantitative methodology I employed. From a detailed guide on the Python script I developed and instructions on how to use it, to an overview of what the data reveals about the newsgroups I’ve been studying, these resources aim to provide a deeper understanding of both the technical and thematic dimensions of this research.</p>

            <p><sup>1</sup> For this page, I drew most of my information from this amazing book that I highly recommend for anyone seeking a more in-depth understanding: Christopher Lueg and Danyel Fisher, eds., <em>From Usenet to CoWebs, Computer Supported Cooperative Work</em> (London: Springer, 2003), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-0057-7" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-0057-7</a>.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> When describing it to others, I like to think of Usenet as the Reddit before Reddit, and without a centralized authority.</p>
