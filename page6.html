        <!-- Initial Visualizations -->
        <button class="collapsible">5.2 Initial Visualizations</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Distribution of Comments per Newsgroup</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/distribution_of_comments_per_newsgroup.png" alt="Distribution of Comments per Newsgroup">
            <p>The bar chart demonstrates the volume of comments across various newsgroups, highlighting that 'net.politics' and 'net.singles' are the most active, with over 12,000 comments each. In contrast, 'net.motss' and 'net.med' have fewer comments, indicating either a smaller user base or less frequent posting. This distribution reflects the varied focus and appeal of each newsgroup, where some topics naturally attract more debate and participation than others.</p>

            <h2>Average Number of Comments per Thread by Newsgroup</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/average_comments_per_thread_by_newsgroup.png" alt="Average Number of Comments per Thread by Newsgroup">
            <p>This bar chart shows that some newsgroups, such as 'net.politics' and 'net.singles,' have higher engagement rates, with more comments per thread on average compared to others like 'net.news' and 'net.motss.' The variation in comments suggests differing levels of community engagement or topic interest. 'net.politics,' likely driven by the inherently debatable nature of its subject matter, encourages more extensive discussion per thread, while 'net.news' may serve more as an information dissemination group with fewer interactive dialogues.</p>

            <h2>Growth of Newsgroups Over Time</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/growth_of_newsgroups_over_time.png" alt="Growth of Newsgroups Over Time">
            <p>The line chart depicts the cumulative number of newsgroups over time, showing a steady increase from 1982 to 1986. This growth signifies a broadening scope of interests and topics on Usenet, likely corresponding with the expanding user base and the platform’s increasing accessibility. The chart illustrates how Usenet evolved to accommodate a more diverse set of discussions, indicating its growing role as a multifaceted communication medium.</p>

            <h2>Number of Threads Across All Newsgroups Over Time</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/number_of_threads_over_time.png" alt="Number of Threads Across All Newsgroups Over Time">
            <p>This plot shows fluctuations in the number of threads initiated over time, with noticeable peaks in the mid-1980s. These peaks could correlate with major global events or cultural phenomena that sparked widespread discussion. The sharp decline in threads towards the end of the period may indicate either a shift in user engagement or platform changes, such as the impact of 'The Great Renaming' or the emergence of alternative online communication platforms.</p>

            <p>The heatmap provides a visual representation of posting activity across different times of the week. There is a noticeable peak in activity during weekday mornings, particularly around 9-11 AM, suggesting that users are more active during traditional working hours. This could reflect the professional background of many early Usenet users, who might be accessing the platform from workplaces. Conversely, weekends show a marked decline in activity, reinforcing the idea of Usenet as part of work-related routines rather than leisure.</p>

            <h2>Author Engagement: Comments Made vs. Threads Initiated</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/author_engagement_scatterplot.png" alt="Author Engagement: Comments Made vs. Threads Initiated">
            <p>This scatter plot illustrates a clear positive correlation between the number of threads an author initiates and the total number of comments they make across Usenet newsgroups. Authors who start more threads tend to engage more actively, contributing more frequently to ongoing discussions. The trend suggests that more proactive users—those who initiate conversations—are also likely to participate more extensively, either by continuing the dialogue they begin or by engaging across other threads.</p>

            <h2>Top 25 Most Active Users by Newsgroup</h2>
            <img src="images and tables/top_25_most_active_users_by_newsgroup.png" alt="Top 25 Most Active Users by Newsgroup">
            <p>The horizontal bar chart identifies the top 25 most active users across different newsgroups, showing the diversity of engagement across topics. The varied lengths of the bars indicate that while some users are highly specialized, focusing their activity on one or two newsgroups, others contribute across multiple groups. This data highlights influential users and suggests the presence of both niche participants and broadly engaged users in the early Usenet ecosystem.</p>
