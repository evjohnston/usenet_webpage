*Ceremonial Chemistry* by Thomas  Szasz.   The book is published 
by ""Doubleday/Anchor""  Garden City, New York, 1975.    I included his
references.   I have added several items of interest and I have deleted
some things I did not feel were relevant (Szasz documents the parallel
course of relgious history).  All unattributed items (no footnote) 
are from the book.
	Please forgive typos.  It is fairly long and I cannot spend
too much time on it being as I have to earn a living.
	My impression as I collected this and typed it in is that it has
all been done before.   The panic, the draconian solutions, and the ultimate
ineffectuality of the solutions.    Even Russia, the most oppressive state
in history, has considerable drug use.   
	Some of the people that support the war on drugs are acting under
the assumption that laws against drug use somehow restrict their use.
This is absurd.   If we give up rights, like the right to buy anything
we want, the rights are gone.   If there is a good reason, e.g., I am
happy to give up my right to murder people in exchange for not being murdered
myself, it might be worthwhile.   However, history tells us that were to
accept the level of repression and state control that exists in the modern
day USSR, we would still have a drug problem.  All that would have happened
is that we would have given up our other rights.

		characteristic of its effects. . . . It seems to make
		the individual, for the time, a better and greater man. . . .
		The hallucinations, the delirious imaginations of alcoholic
		intoxication, are, in general, quite wanting.  Along

		concluded: ""There is no evidence of any weight regarding the
		mental and moral injuries from the moderate use of these
		drugs. .. . . Moderation does not lead to excess in hemp any
		more than it does in alcohol.   Regular, moderate use of ganja
		or bhang produces the same effects as moderate and regular
		doses of whiskey.""  The commission's proposal to tax bhang
		is never put into effect, in part, perhaps, because one of
		the commissioners, an Indian, cautions that Moslem law and
		Hindu custom forbid ""taxing anything that gives pleasure

		intelligent opinion that habitual and periodic drunkenness
		is often either a symptom or sequel of disease . . . . The

1900		In an address to the Ecumenical Missionary Conference, Rev.
		Wilbur F. Crafts declares: ""No Christian celebration of the
		completion of nineteen Christian centuries has yet been 
		arranged.  Could there be a fitter one than the general 
		adoption, by separate and joint action of the great nations
		of the world, of the new policy of civilization, in which
		Great Britian is leading, the policy of prohibition for the
		native races, in the interest of commerce as well as 
		conscience, since the liquor traffic among child races, 
		even more manifestly than in civilized lands, injures all
		other trades by producing poverty, disease, and death.
		Our object, more profoundly viewed, is to create a more 
		favorable environment for the child races that civilized
		nations are essaying to civilize and Christianize.""

1902		George E. Petty, writing in the *Alabama Medical Journal*,
		observes: ""Many articles have appeared in the medical 
		literature during the last two years lauding this new agent
		. . . .  When we consider the fact that heroin is a morphine
		derivative . . . it does not seem reasonable that such a 
		claim could be well founded.  It is strange that such a claim
		should mislead anyone or that there should be found among
		the members of our profession those who would reiterate 
		and accentuate it without first subjecting it to the most
		critical tests, but such is the fact."" [Quoted in Lennard
		et. al., op. cit. p. 1079]

		he characterizes the Indian peyote religion a ""habit 
		indulgence in certain cactaceous plants,"" calls the belief
		system ""superstition"" and those who sell peyote ""dope vendors,""
		and urges the passage of a bill in Congress that would prohibit
		the use of peyote among the Indian tribes of the Southwest.
		He concludes with this revealing plea for abolition: ""The
		great difficulty in suppressing this habit among the Indians
		arises from the fact that the commercial interests involved
		in the peyote traffic are strongly entrenched, and they 
		exploit the Indian. . . . Added to this is the superstition
		of the Indian who believes in the Peyote Church.  As soon
		as an effort is made to suppress peyote, the cry is raised
		that it is unconstitutional to do so and is an invasion of
		religious liberty.  Suppose the Negros of the South had
		Cocaine Church!"" [Thomas S. Blair, Habit indulgence in

		prescription. . . . Addicts who are broke act as *agent
		provocateurs* for the peddlers, being rewarded by gifts
		of heroin or credit for supplies.  The Harrison Act made

		than a million lepers among our people.  Think what a shock
		the announcement would produce!  Yet drug addiction is far
		more incurable than leprosy, far more tragic to its victims,
		and is spreading like a moral and physical scourge. . . .
		Most of the daylight robberies, daring holdups, cruel murders
		and similar crimes of violence are now known to be committed
		chiefly by drug addicts, who constitute the primary cause
		of our alarming crime wave.   Drug addiction is more 
		communicable and less curable that leprosy. . . .
		Upon the issue hangs the perpetuation of civilization,
		the destiny of the world, and the future of the human
		race."" [Quoted in Musto, *The American Disease*, p. 191]
1928		It is estimated that in Germany one out of every hundred

		dangerous, habit-forming drugs.  But once the principle
		is admitted that is the duty of government to protect
		the individual against his own foolishness, no serious
		objections can be advanced against further encroachments.
		A good case could be made out in favor of the prohibition
		of alcohol and nicotine.   And why limit the governments
		benevolent providence to the protection of the individual's
		body only?  Is is not the harm a man can inflect on his
		mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily
		evils?  Why not prevent him from reading bad books and
		seeing bad plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues
		and listening to bad music?   The mischief done by bad

""Anthropologist Uli Linke of the University of California at Berkely
suggests in the Jan. 17 _Science_ that the practice of clitorodectomy
may provide an explaination [of the heterosexual transmission of AIDS
in Africa].  Areas in Africa where part of the female genitalia is
ritually removed correspond to the areas of the epidemic, she says.
After some types of clitorodectomy, vaginal intercourse can cause
bleeding, and anal intercourse is often substituted.  Either practice,
notes Linke, could encourage spread of the virus.""

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------
	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to
the Press conference AND all three patients died in the week following.

""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')

(and again reproduced without permission),

                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's

it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

things, peroxide, is simply illadvised, bad folk-medicine, something we
certainly don't need right now when it comes to AIDS.  There are lots of
agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not
having sex with them.
Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most
likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS.  That simply isn't true.
It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.
Here is an overview of the guidelines to reduce risk of AIDS
for ***everyone***, male or female, gay or straight:

Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted
out of the New York Post or some similarly inane publication?  I mean,
you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the 
posting were about something which affected only women, then it would
make some sense.  How about a posting on how *pregnancy* is incurred,
with detailed descriptions of sex acts.  Go on.  I DARE you. Nyaa-Nyaa-Nyaa.

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed
Matt Crawford!  HA!  Now I can leave you wondering whether I've 
actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never
lepton his hadron, excited his fundamental modes, accepted an
injection of hot magma into my steaming caldera, intersected his
orbital, or even licked his throbbing popsicle.  
I will still maintain that a discussion of AIDS is inappropriate
for this newsgroup, not because it affects more men than women,
but because it is fundamentally absurd to assume that a classification
of people based on sex makes sex a primary concern.

Sure, and it also affects birdwatchers, and unix-wizards, and people
who watch tv, and pretty much everyone who reads any group on the
net.  That doesn't mean it should be posted to every group there is!
AIDS is a medical problem and belongs in net.med.  Period.
Those interested in reading information about AIDS may subscribe
to net.med.  Those interested in whatever net.women is doing these days
(I gave up on net.women a while back due to a poor S/N ratio) but
not interested in AIDS shouldn't have to wade through a bunch of
AIDS articles.
Taking your thinking to it's logical conclusion, there would be
one newsgroup.  What a mess.  Usenet is collapsing under it's own
weight, and posting articles to umpty-zillion newsgroups isn't
helping.

If they are shared by both sexes then definitely.  There is a newsgroup called
'net.med' specifically for medical issues.  You should use that.

These kind of remarks are uncalled for.  This guy was making a genuine point

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]
""The specter of an AIDS catastrophe looms over Africa, driving home
the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent
the call for a US research effort on the scale of the Manhattan
Project.  Not a moment can be lost.""  [Lots of luck communicating
this sense of urgency to Reagan and Reaganoids!]

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

	This topic has already been covered on the net, but to rehash.
In Africa, AIDS is almost unknown between the ages of 2 and puberty.  If it
were spread by mosquitoes, it would be much more prevalent among children and
adolescents.  After all, malaria is.  This argues against mosquito spread.
	Two: of the 500+ uncomplicated needle sticks on record at the CDC done
while blood has been taken from AIDS patients, none has progressed to AIDS or
even (when tested) Antibody posivity.  There are several cases complicated by
other factors, but these are not analogous to Mosquito bites.
The real AIDS epidemic now is
	Acquired INFORMATION deficiency syndrome.

This has been checked out by the CDC, and apparently there is no risk 
for transmission of HTLV-III via an insect vector.  I'm not sure of the
reference, but I think it's a recent issue of JAMA, in the ""Leads from the
MMWR"" section.
By the way, the virus is inactivated by high and low pH and by exposure to a
temperature of 56 C for ten minutes.  Most standard disinfectants (Lysol,
Clorox) and halogenated hand soaps will also inactivate the virus.

Not knowing what `inspire' means, and only having a shitty dictionary at
hand, I can only guess that the definition you're using is either
   a) ""stimulate to activity"" -- sad but true, or
   b) ""inhale"" (or maybe ingest in some other fashion)
Anyway, could you (or someone) elaborate on ways in which AIDS is acquired
from women?
Also, I just realized that I know that AIDS can be transmitted
via semen or blood, but I don't know how such fluids must contact or
be ingested by the recipient.  For example, I would guess that AIDS
could be transmitted in menstrual fluids (can it also be found in
non-blood vaginal secretions?), but I don't know if it can be
transmitted to a person by bodily contact, or by oral sex.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

says, it can't hurt and may be helpful.  The only reservation is for those
who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such

hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the
least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine.  This is the only reason he
is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

There are now confirmed reports of men with no history of homosexual

prostitutes.
One of the medical workers who poked him/herself with a needle used to
draw blood from an AIDS patient has come down with AIDS.
Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the

society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

related complex (ARC). Of those tested, none has tested Antibody Positive
for HTLV-3.
	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.

facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference

	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

* I can understand accidental needle-sticks -- I've cut and poked myself
enough to realize that even professionals trained to handle sharp
instruments will have accidents with them. However, can someone explain
how THIS happened? The only scenario I can come up with is that someone
carrying a hypo full of blood fell down, and managed both to stick
themselves in falling and also depress the plunger to inject themselves,
rather than breaking off the needle or smashing the hypo (both of which
seem more likely). Anybody have any detailed explanation?

survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.
I understand your position, but dissagree.  I assume you feel the same.

	Food Can affect people's moods, researchers say
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers at the University of Chicago
	have made it official: You are, indeed, what you eat.
	The researchers said that they have established a definite
	link between food and moodiness, including irritability,
	anxiety and depression.
	But it is too early to pinpoint particular foods as the
	source of certain moods, Dr. John Crayton, an associate
	professor of psychiatry who directed the study, said
	Thursday.
	Although doctors still don't understand how, the food-induced
	moodiness also appears related to changes in the immune 
	system, which fights disease, Crayton said.
	""We're not talking about what might be called the 'traditional'
	food allergies, such as breaking out in hives or a rash
	after eating certain foods, but marked changes in mood
	and behavior,"" he said.
	""Such a link has been theorized but it has seldom been
	studied and almost never shown,"" he said.
	Crayton's group studied 35 volunteers who were fed controlled
	diets of capsules containing powdered wheat, milk, 
	chocolate and a placebo over eight days.
	The volunteers included 23 psychiatric patients who 
	had complained of food sensitivity the past, and 12 
	healthy people with no such complaints.
	Neither  the researchers nor the participants knew
	the capsules' contents until the project was completed
	Crayton said.
	Among the 23 volunteers who had histories of food complaints
	16 developed marked mood and behavior changes, and they
	showed alteration in their immune system as well, he said.
	Mood changes were linked to wheat and milk, but chocolate
	was less likely to cause anxiety, irritability or depression,
	he said.	
 
	The immune system changes included a higher level of proteins
	that help control the immune system's reactions, and lower
	levels of proteins formed in the course of an immune system
	reaction.
	One theory about the relationship, he said, is that substances
	formed during an immune system reaction cause local 
	swelling of the brain, which could trigger mood swings.

mood, mind and behavior (as Dr. Jeff Bland & Dr. Alexander Schauss

Those  working in the new medical field called ""CLINICAL ECOLOGY""
have been seeing this for years.  Of course, the predictable response
by the conventional allergists (for the past 40 years) has been to try
to destroy anyone practicing Clinical Ecology.  There is presently a
Bill pending in California, sponsored by the California Medical Assn.,
along with the California Allergists Assn., to prevent the practice of
Clinical Ecology.  While on the other hand, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
Texas has just been handed a $10,000,000.00 punative judgement because
they refused to pay for a Clinical Ecological workup in Dallas.
Not only was the $10 million awarded but Blue Cross also had to pay
all court costs, lawyers fees & all the medical expenses.
A number of studies have shown that if you will put any large group of
institutionalized mental patients on a strict water fast for 1 week
that, by the seventh day 75% of them will have lost whatever mental
abberation they had had.  Of course, as soon as they are put back on
their regular diet, the symptoms recur.  The job of the Clinical
Ecologist is to construct a program the individual can live with
outside the hospital.  Interestingly enough, the same statistics are
true of rheumatoid arthritics.  Their symptoms do not always
completely go away; the reports indicate about 75% have significant to
marked improvements in their arthritic signs and symptoms.
Truly:  YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!  What else could you be?  Sometime I
will share on the net the major exception to that statement: many
people, especially older ones, have significant difficulty absorbing
some of the more difficult nutrients necessary for a healthy human.

The members of the American Holistic Medical Association, the
International Academy of Preventive Medicine, as well as many other
practitioners of a Holistic approach to medical care have known, for
ears, the basic mechanism of AIDS.  In the beginning a few
conventional researchers dared to suggest the truth but no one really
liked the idea because it didn't provide for the ""white knight of
modern medicine"" to ride to the rescue.  It didn't provide the
pharmaceutical industry with a new patent to exploit for 17 years (or
however long a patent runs now).  And, it didn't fit the conventional
paradigm of causation of disease.
Now, however, nearly all researchers are forced to admit the obvious:
AIDS virus cannot infect an AVERAGE healthy human being, let alone a
truly vigorously healthy person.  The virus is an opportunist: it
preys only on those persons whose immune systems are already on the
verge of collapse.  The problem is: the virus attacks what is left of
the immune system and finishes it off.  It is the other opportunistic
pathogens (that have been known for years) that then finish off the
victim.
A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in
western industrialized society, was exposed to >1000 times as many
stresses/person/day as people were 100 years ago, and that the rate
was increasing faster every year.  90% 0f those stresses were not
psychological, or social, but, were physical, chemical, nutritional,
electromagnetic smog, etc.; ENVIRONMENTAL stresses that didn't even
exist 100 years ago.
Biofeedback research shows us that all stresses cause a fight or
flight response; whether physical or psychological.  If the running or
fighting isnt actually done the readiness to do so accumulates.
Finally, the limit of ""readiness"" is reached and the person has
insufficient reserves to resist the puny AIDS virus.  The newly
discovered ""carriers"" of AIDS simply are a little further up the ""bell
curve"" of resistance in this society: enough resistance to avoid the
disease but not enough to kill the virus completely.
We have the distinction of living in the generation when larger, and
larger #s of people are falling below the critical level on the bell
curve of immunity in this country.  Another perfect example of the
superiority of prevention over treatment.
There is good in all bad things:  The vast amounts of $ being thrown
into AIDS research has allowed us to be able to measure TINY changes
in immune status.  We now have the proof,Holistic Practitioners have
been looking for, of how and why so many of the mind body approaches
work.  The new medical specialty: PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY, has been
spawned by these advances.

nutritional, electromagnetic smog--ENVIRONMENTEL stresses; each of
which cause a ""fight or flight"" response.  If the person does not
actually run or fight, the readiness to do so accumulates.
Eventually,a larger, and larger % of people have used up their
reserves to the point where even a puny virus like AIDS can survive.

	Bill Stoll's article on holistic medicine and AIDS
raises some questions in the mind of a layman.  I will excerpt
his article.

Was it published? References, please?
BTW, what is the relation between the International Academy of
Preventive Medicine and main-stream M.D.-type medicine? (A
question for both Mr. (Dr?) Stoll and mainstream M.D.'s.
>In the beginning a few
>conventional researchers dared to suggest the truth but no one really
>liked the idea because ... it didn't fit the conventional
>paradigm of causation of disease. [The ellipsis covers a few
sentences.]
The idea, that AIDS requires a breakdown of the immune system
after prolonged stress, reminds me of the work of Hans Selye.
I had the impression he was respected by main-stream medicine.
If this is the case, is it consistent with supposing that
main-stream medicine pooh-poohed the Holists' view of AIDS?
>A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in

References, please?  AND critical treatment of these issues:
(a) What is your universal quantitative measurement of the
severity of a ""stress"", and how is this measurement justified?
(b) How did the West Germans measure the stresses that people
were subjected to 100 years ago, and how were these stresses
quantitatively compared to those of today?
Consider the environmental stresses that people faced 100
years ago, in comparison with those of today.  Driving is
stressful; but being limited to the speed of a horse and buggy
( ~ 4 miles per hour) must have been frustrating and therefore
stressful as well.  Which is better?  Well, which have you chosen
for yourself?
Then there were the nutritional stresses... no fresh green
veggies in winter, no refrigeration in summer, food preserved
by smoking or salting it... (too much salt in the diet, not to
mention carcinogens galore)... Somewhere I read once that in
the early 1800's, English bakers frequently put alum in their
bread to whiten it. (Cross reference discussion of aluminum
and Alzheimer's Disease.) A consequence was kidney/bladder
stones; Eton's infirmary had a ward for boys with bladder
stones.
This is getting far afield of AIDS; but it makes me feel
uncertain that, where holistic medicine is valid, it is all
that far from main-line M.D. medicine.

The members of the American Holistic Medical Association, the
International Academy of Preventive Medicine, as well as many other
practitioners of a Holistic approach to medical care have known, for
years,the basic mechanism of AIDS.  In the beginning a few
conventional researchers dared to suggest the truth but no one really
liked the idea because it didn't provide for the ""white knight of
modern medicine"" to ride to the rescue.  It didn't provide the
pharmaceutical industry with a new patent to exploit for 17 years (or
however long a patent runs now).  And, it didn't fit the conventional
paradigm of causation of disease.
Now, however, nearly all researchers are forced to admit the obvious:
AIDS virus cannot infect an AVERAGE healthy human being, let alone a
truly vigorously healthy person.  The virus is an opportunist: it
preys only on those persons whose immune systems are already on the
verge of collapse.  The problem is: the virus attacks what is left of
the immune system and finishes it off.  It is the other opportunistic
pathogens (that have been known for years) that then finish off the
victim.
A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in
western industrialized society, was exposed to >1000 times as many
stresses/person/day as people were 100 years ago, and that the rate
was increasing faster every year.  90% of those stresses were not
psychological, or social, but, were physical, chemical, nutritional,
electromagnetic smog, etc.; ENVIRONMENTAL stresses that didn't even
exist 100 years ago.
Biofeedback research shows us that all stresses cause a fight or
flight response; whether physical or psychological.  If the running or
fighting isnt actually done the readiness to do so accumulates.
Finally, the limit of ""readiness"" is reached and the person has
insufficient reserves to resist the puny AIDS virus.  The newly
discovered ""carriers"" of AIDS simply are a little further up the ""bell
curve"" of resistance in this society: enough resistance to avoid the
disease but not enough to kill the virus completely.
We have the distinction of living in the generation when larger, and
larger,#s of people are falling below the critical level on the bell
curve of immunity in this country.  Another perfect example of the
superiority of prevention over treatment.
There is good in all bad things:  The vast amounts of $ being thrown
into AIDS research has allowed us to be able to measure TINY changes
in immune status.  We now have the proof,Holistic Practitioners have
been looking for, of how and why so many of the mind-body approaches

This posting has all the requisite elements of quackery: the familiar ""us""
vs. ""modernmedicalestablishment"" stance, the sweeping statements which
propose THE solution to difficult problems, and the perversion of
incomplete scientific evidence into a grand theory fully of fanciful
embellishments but truly lacking in any kind of scientific basis, let alone
scientific proof.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT PEOPLE WITH ""HEALTHY"" IMMUNE SYSTEMS
ARE SOMEHOW PROTECTED FROM CONTRACTING AIDS.  One might as well make the
same kind of tautological statement about disease in general, and it would
still lack any predictive value for the individual.  Yeah, AIDS is
preventable: to be 100% safe, don't have sex outside of a monogamous
relationship which has remained monogamous for the past 5 years.  The next
best thing is to avoid exchanging bodily fluids with strangers.  Any
""vigorously healthy"" or even ""average"" person would have to be out of his
mind to think that his presumably healthy immune system is immune to
getting AIDS: there are too many ""vigorously healthy"" people who are now
seriously ill or dead.  In many cases, it only took a single infected sex
partner.

The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

	HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen,  although they are a group
of proteins that occur on every cell in the body.  There are 4 groups -
HLA-A,B,C are found on every cell.  HLA-D is particularly prominent on
White Blood Cells.  There are hundreds of types of each letter - so many
in fact, that probably no two people on Earth (except identical twins)
have the same arrangement.  HLAs are also known as Transplantation antigens
-- they are the cause of Rejection following Heart/Kidney/etc. transplant.
	One of them -  HLA-D4 has been shown to react with the antibody to
the virus that presumably causes AIDS.  This is the first case of a true
False Positive with known cause.
	Therefore, people who carry the HLA-D4 gene will register a positive
result to the AIDS blood test, whether or not they have been exposed to the
AIDS virus.  However, it can be checked via other means.
	One explanation for the phenomenon is that the only cell line in
which HTLV-3 will grow carries the HLA-D4, and hence the antibody is raised
to a HLA-D4/HTLV-3 hybrid (also known as a virally-altered self) and then
will react with each component separately.

	The Test checks for antibodies against HTLV3, also known as

normally used in tissue typing for transplants) and the discovery that one,
anti-HLA-DR4, reacted with anti-AIDS antibodies.
	I left out the 'anti's last time and here's where I made the boo-boo.
People who have the HLA-DR4 gene will not test false positive for HTLV3.
For them to have anti-DR4 antibodies would mean that they would be attacking
their own tissues.

	AP) The Government has approved a sec-
	ond screening test for blood contam-
	inated by acquired immune deficiency
	syndrome, or AIDS, after laboratory
	results indicating it was the most sens-
	itive indicator of possible exposure to
	the disorder.
 	  Electro-Nucleonics Inc. of Fairfield,
	N.J., was awarded the second license by
	the FDA ....
About 2 months ago, I ran a series of four articles on HTLV-3, the virus
that most likely causes AIDS. I spoke of the screening test as highly
accurate, and then received mail and flames otherwise.
	Well, here is the source of the misunderstanding. There are several
tests - the most sensitive being the Western blot, which I was referring to.
(This was reasonable, since most Test-Positive results were to be redone
with Western blots before accepting the results.) It has an accuracy of
99.8% or so.
	The first licensed test had an accuracy of approx. 93%. Tests under
development range from 82-95.6%.  These all use a system called ELISA (for
Enzyme-linked Immuno- S? Assay) which is much easier to do than a Western
Blot (Incidentally, Western Blot is so-called, because the first person
to do ""blotting"" was E.M. Southern, so the blot was nick-named the
""Southern Blot"", and each new technique was given a different direction and
the name stuck.) ELISA involves add sample, add reagant, check color change.
	Anyway, this new test has an accuracy of 99.6% (4 false positives
in 1000 people)  which is not much worse than Westerns.
 
	AND, of course the usual disclaimer:  Although everyone with AIDS
has been shown to have antibody to HTLV-3, the reverse is not true.
The presence of antibody to HTLV-3 does not signify that a person has or
will get AIDS, but has merely been exposed to it or a cross-reacting virus.

According to the Merck manual (which is basically a catalog of human disease):
			""REITER'S SYNDROME
	""Arthritis associated with nonbacterial urethritis and conjunctivitis,
usually seen in adult males following recent sexual exposure; it may also fol-
low an acute attack of unexplained diarrhea (dysentery). ... The syndrome seems
to be a response to infection with shigella or infectious agents transmitted
venereally (e.g chlamydia) in a genetically susceptible host.""
The manual goes into too great detail to quote here. However, for treatment
it mentions anti-inflamatory agents (e.g. aspirin or indomethacin or phen-
ylbutazone), physical therapy during the recovery phase (the typical case
resolves in 3-4 months, but 50% of patients experience transient recurrences
over a period of several years). Corticosteroids not useful! Methotrexate or the
folic acid antagonists may lead to symptomatic improvement in patients with
severe illness, but they are toxic. Tetracycline may control the urethritis.

I thought chlamydia was a bacteria.  Yet here we have Merck
saying that Reiters is associated with 'nonbacterial
urethritis'; and proposing that tetracycline may control it...
Am I reading this wrong or what?  Is chlamydia a bacteria or a virus?
Can tetracycline do anything against viruses?
And what is this chlamydia stuff anyway.  I'd never heard of it
before, and now its in magazine articles and on the net.  Is this

I double checked the Merck manual and that's indeed what it says.
Chlamydia IS a bacteria. It often is the cause of urethritis.
Over the past few years I have gotten non-gonococchal urethritis many times.
My doctor, when finding a negative result from the gonorhea culture has
just presumed it is chlamydia without further confirmation since culturing
it is difficult; the bacteria stay in the cells and culturing for it would
involve getting infected cells into the culture medium or something like that.

Well,
Chlamydia is bacteria-like and tetracycline is the drug of choice.
Chlamydia is normally associated as the bugger responsible for non-specific
urethritis, or better known as non-gonococcal urethritis.
Tetracycline, acts as a bacteriostatic, that is it stops bacteria from 
dividing, thus allowing your own immune system to catch up and take care 
of the problem.  It works quite well against chlamydia.  It does not have
any action against viruses( why isn't the plural for virus, viri?).
The second drug of choice is erythromycin which works a little like 
penicillin in that it causes the dividing bacteria to produce defective 
cell walls.
The Merck Manual (oh, by the way Merck is a drug company, not an author),
indicates that tetracycline is intended for the urethritis, not the
Reiters syndrome.
Reiters results from an autoimmune reaction that can be triggered 
by a chlamydia invasion, presumably because the antibodies produced against 
the chlamydia also have a slight tendency to attach to certain types of 
collagen found in certain types of cartilage that are located in certain
places in and around your body.  Rheumatic fever is a very similar problem,
where antibodies to streptococcus like to attach to the elastic fibers 
in the valves of your heart, thus the phrase ""my rheumatic heart"" and the 
reason that you should not let a persistant sore throat go unnoticed.  
Reiters is not specifically the result of a chlamydia infection.
Chlamydia has been around for about 3 billion +_ 1 billion years.  It however
is becoming noticed because of its increased contribution to the venereal
disease problem that we Americans just love to maintain.  It seems to have
developed in the last 2 years a tendency to produce a more pronounced set
of symptoms making it a little more obvious to the males that become
infected, and as a result more cases are being reported.

The question is: Is chlamydia a bacteria or a virus?
The answer is Yes and/or No.
	Chlamydia is like a bacteria (only smaller) in that it does much
of its own synthesis, but like a virus in that it is an obligate
intracellular parasite.
	Normal	antibiotics act on the bacterial cell wall so will not
kill chlamydia, hence the reason it is classed with 'nonbacterial
urethritis.'  However, tetracycline interferes with bacterial protein
synthesis, so will affect chlamydia in some cases.
	Why all the fuss about it?
	One: it used to be there was a lot of gonorhea and syphilis and
that hid all the other venereal diseases. That's less so now.
	Two: it used to be impossible to detect. Now it's easy, so the
reason there is ""an epidemic"" is not because its more widespread, but
because most likely of better diagnosis.
	Three: some of things it causes are pretty nasty.

I know of two theories on this  point.  One  seems  reasonable,  the  other
frighteningly paranoid.
Reasonable:
One of the primary vectors of AIDS is anal  intercourse.  This  is  because
the  lining  of  the  rectum isn't built for such treatment and can develop
tears which provide a  direct  path  to  the  bloodstream.  The  virus  (or
whatever) is carried and passed on in semen.
Paranoid:
It is rumored that AIDS may be  part  of  a  biological-warfare  experiment
being performed by our own military.  The rumor contends they are testing a
virus that attacks  only  people  with  certain  specific  body  chemistry.
Ultimate  goal: a bug that kills only Russians (for example).  Legionaire's
Disease is said to have been a prototype.
I would discount these as paranoid  ravings  but  for  the  fact  that  our
military  was actually caught doing something almost as cold-blooded in the
San Francisco Bay area not  so  long  ago.  They  deliberately  released  a
tailored mild flu virus in the Bay area to see how the winds would disperse
it, based on patterns of who  caught  the  flu.  Five  innocent,  unknowing
citizens DIED because of that experiment.  Since then, I don't put ANYTHING
past them.
(If any of this is true, I suppose I'll be quietly abducted,  interrogated,
and disposed of in the next week or so -- all for passing on cocktail party
conversation.  Who says it's 1985?)

It's important not to turn a single, controversial article in the JAMA into
popular folklore--the facts simply aren't there.  About all one can say now
about the transmission of AIDS is that it requires the exchange of bodily
fluids.  The present epidemiology of the syndrome is adequately explained
by the characteristics of the populations in which it occurs.

	Well, it was actually more than a single article, and there were 
similar articles in Science and Nature.  
The facts are:
	1. HTLV-3 (the Aids-Related Virus) is found primarily in blood, but
also in saliva and semen, and maybe other places that haven't been explored
yet.
	2. The rectum is a) bacteriologically speaking, an exceptionally dirty
place, and b) not designed for intercourse (wrong epithelium).
 
	However, Steve does have his point. Just because something makes sense
logically, doesn't mean it is correct. Also, just as a grammatical point, the
use of the word ""vector"" was wrong. The correct phrase should have been
""means of transmission.""

	Where do people come up with these things?
	The virus has been around Africa for years, and does not solely
affect gays there.  
	It is passed, both in Africa and among non-Gays in the US (mostly IV
drug users) much more efficiently from men to women than from women to men,
mostly because semen contains cells that could be infected with the virus
(as does in some people, saliva). Hence it would, for similar reasons, pass
efficiently from men to men.
	It's not actually gays, per se, it's only sexually active gays, and
they are also highly overrepresented among a whole variety of rare diseases,
mostly sexually transmitted ones, but also hepatitis, etc.
	Also, remember, one of the first AIDS victims back in 1977 
admitted having over 2000 sexual partners (I think in the previous year alone,
but that number may be over several). A few people like that and that's all
you need for a major epidemic.
 
	Conclusion: given the mode of transmission of the virus (in blood,
semen and saliva) and the fact that healthy carriers can pass the disease,
and given the promiscuity of a visible subgroup of the gay population, it's
not really much of a suprise (now anyway that more is known) that gays are
overrepresented among AIDS victims.

	Glad this came up. I was going to post the following eventually
anyway, but now it seems relevant.
	Non-A non-B Hepatitis is a generic name for any type of hepatitis
that can not be linked to either one of the two known viruses (i.e. A or B)
It is currently the most common form of hepatitis world-wide and there have
been no advances towards a vaccine in the absence of a known cause, although a 
third virus was detected.
	Recently, an article and paper appeared in JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, entitled:            ^(Dec 14 '84 252/22)
	International Findings point to Third Hepatitis Virus (article)
	Epidemic non-A non-B Hepatitis in Nepal (paper, p. 3140)
It appears that a new virus, call it C, is a retrovirus (as is HTLV-3, the
virus that causes AIDS) meaning that it has a different life cycle of 
normal viruses in that it becomes part of the cells it infects permanently
and does not kill them, along with many other differences.
	I realize that this does not answer the question that was actually
asked, but its something worth knowing. Perhaps looking at the references
in the paper might provide a clue where to look, however.

	I have my own small addition, I tested positive for ""hepatitis""
last summer, but negative for A/B.  I eventually discovered I had

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.
Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

Should someone who tests positive tell a potential sex partner?  Or are
safe sex guidelines sufficient that such disclosure isn't necessary?  People
who argue that testing is superfluous would, I think, also believe disclosure
to a potential/current sex partner is unnecessary.
I don't know what my answer is to any of the questions so far.  I do know
that I was very upset to hear retroactively a repeated partner had Hepatitus-B,
and we hadn't heard much of safe-sex at the time.
This question is important to me since I have the oppotunity to participate
in some AIDS data gathering experiments at an area clinic.  They are very
confidential.  It is also important since a friend recently told me he tests
positive and is choosing to err on the side of candor with partners.

The originally posted question was whether you have ought to tell a sexual
partner if you had a positive HTLV-III test. A positive antibody test does
*not* mean you have AIDS.

To whom? What would be the benefit? If you tested negative, you *still* should
practice safe sex, for your partner's sake (since some people who shed the
virus test negative on the antibody test) and for your own (since
your partner may infect you). If you tested negative and you had
other-that-safe-sex, the test results would no longer be valid.
As far as our current knowledge of the significance of the test, I can
see only one reason for being tested, that being reassurance that one
has not been exposed to AIDS.

This may be true to some, but it does not bother me. I do not enter into
relationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness of
somebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)
even date them. I do not make friends with those I cannot trust. Trust is
an essential part of friendship, and an even greater part of an ""intimate
relationship"". We generally don't tend towards ""unsafe sex"" anyway, but that
is not the point. The point is that I can trust my s'other with my life. If
I couldn't, he would not be my s'other. 
If one could guarantee one's s'other is faithful, he (s'other) would not be, in
a sense, faithful. Faithfulness comes through volition. A technique which would
guarantee the he would not go out on me would make him do so with or without
his volition.
I do not look forward to death, but I have come to terms with it. It will
happen to everybody at some time or another. It's part of life. The important
thing I think is that we repect other people's lives. That is why, in my
opinion, people should practise ""safe sex"" if they are to have encounters
outside of a monogomous relationship. It is not really for my safety that
I would worry about transmitting AIDS, but because I wouldn't want to give
it to any other person. For that reason, I would submit to the test.
By the way, I'm not trying to seem like a saint; I probably could not
handle the guilt of making somebody so ill, essentially killing them. Also, I
would not relish the of dying from AIDS (I would prefer old age, and in my
sleep), but that is not the point. I would rather not know if I was going to
die; that would tend to ruin my day. But I do have an obligation to find this
out if there is a chance I will infect another person.
My s'other and I have been together long enough that if one of us has it,
then probably we both do. But since we will not be affecting anybody else,
I do not see it necessary to be tested. Thus, my opinion.",FhgStjPmxOgJ,19,1986-03-21,-10,2

The intention had to do with whether or not one should be tested to determine
whether one could transmit the virus which causes AIDS. If it was not believed
that HTLV-III causes AIDS (or someother such problem), then the question
would undoubtedly not been ask. Therefore, though I will admit I was verbatim,
I caught the underlying meaning of the question and therefore I think this
point is irrelevant.

Obligation to others. If I was infected, I would not practise sex. Period.
Others might choose safe sex, though. I think there is no guarantee of
anything being safe. Positive results definitely suggest the capability to
infect others, negative result are more questionable, especially several
tests over a period of time with all neg. results. I covered the rest of the
points in another post.

This seems to be to contradict sentence 3, the section in the first set of
parentheses. I may not understand, though. Please clarify. It seems to
me that if a neg. result says the subject has not been exposed to AIDS
(I assume the virus here since AIDS is a syndrome, not something a person
can be exposed to (I think)), then s/he could not have had the virus to
shed in the first place. And what do you mean ""shed"". As I understood it,

discussed here in any length, namely, whether or not to be tested
for exposure to HTLV-III.
I had dinner recently with a couple, one of whom is a psychiatrist, the other
a psychiatric social worker, who both work for Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Counseling Service.  Aside from the obvious issues of stigmatization and
confidentiality, they ask men who are concerned about HTLV-III exposure
and are considering being tested:
	""What would you do differently, if you knew?""
They argued pretty persuasively against being tested, for the following
reasons:
1.) a negative test is no license for increased sexual activity
    (to be meaningful, you'd have to be tested weeks to months after
    each new sexual partner, when in the meantime, you could be spreading
    the virus.)  In essence, every gay man should be behaving as if he were
    exposed, regardless of the test results.
2.) Denial (as in not knowing one's HTLV-III exposure) can be thought of as
    having some positive effects.  Too often, they have seen people who went
    to be tested out of curiosity, who, after hearing that they test positive,
    end up with severe emotional stress, certainly reducing their quality of
    life.

There certainly are political concerns against taking it, most of which are

have no right to the information can often obtain it against our will.
But for me, the deciding factor was the consequences.  I asked my doctor
what his advice is to patients who test negative (no HTLV-III virus), and
he said that he recommends following the safe sex guidelines and reducing
the number of sex partners, to avoid exposure to the virus.  Then I asked
what his advice is to patients with the virus, and his advice was the same,
to avoid exposing their partners.
The ""relief"" I might feel from a negative test result would in no way

utensils etc. is extremely low, and I consider it to be only polite to
be considerate (extremely considerate) of the health of others.
If you can take the screen without endangering yourself somehow (i.e.
the test is anonymous) I recommend you do so, not for yourself, but
for your friends.

A few years ago I signed up for an AIDS research study being done by the
University of Pittsburgh, as part of a four city project funded by the National
Institutes of Health (the other cities are, to the best of my recollection,
Baltimore, Chicago, and San Francisco).  The study started before HTLV-III
had even been identified, and thus part of the goal of the study was to track
the factors that may be involved in causing AIDS.  I had no reservations about
joining, since I have a very strong belief in empirical research (I sign up for
human interface studies at every opportunity, and always used to participate in
psych experiments as an undergraduate). 
Volunteers in the study came in twice a year to be interviewed on sexual
practices, undergo a physical, and give samples of blood (over a dozen vials at
a time; ouch), urine, semen (this was the fun part) and stool (blech! I can't
see myself ever getting into scat).  I knew at the time that a portion of my
blood would be frozen, to undergo whatever testing might become available at a
future time.  However, I hadn't really thought about the implications of a test
for a virus (or, as it turns out, antibodies to a virus), and I certainly hadn't
thought about many of the political and personal issues.  
In retrospect, the only surprise was that the virus and tests were discovered so
quickly; I would have signed up for the study even after LAV/HTLV-III had been
identified.  Why?  Because we still don't know why only a small percentage of
infected people actually come down with AIDS, and hence this sort of research is
very important.
I should also add that this particular study has been granted some sort of
insurance of confidentiality by the Feds.  I'm not quite sure what this implies,
but presumably it means that their records are more protected than a county
HTLV-III testing program for example.  On the other hand, this certificate was
given after I signed up for the study, so confidentiality obviously wasn't a
priority to me.
Once HTLV-III testing became available, the study did indeed retrieve the stored
blood, and start testing all of the participants.  (Nothing underhanded; we knew
that the potential for this was there when we signed up, although I suspect most
volunteers, like myself, hadn't thought about it very much.)  However, it was
entirely up to us as to whether we wanted to learn the results.  One of the
requirements for getting your results was that you had to participate in a group
discussion session and an individual counseling session before any HTLV-III
results would be revealed.  I think this was an excellent idea, far better than
the health department testing mills, even though I had to pull strings to bypass
this requirement (since I moved to New England before my results were
available).  
As I just indicated, I decided to find out what my results were.  Mostly this
was for my own peace of mind (although, if the tests had turned out positive, it
would have proved that the virus had a much longer incubation period that
previously suspected :-).  But also it was to help me decide how to lead my
life.  I think that if I had tested positive I would either a) decided to remain
celibate, which is close to what I've been doing anyway; b) limited my dating to
other men who tested positive, either through support groups or candid personal
ads; or c) limited my sexual activity to strictly safe, kinky stuff with little
or no chance of emotional attachments forming.
Which brings me to the last question, namely should a person who test positive
inform partners?  My response, as indicated, is that I would choose to avoid 
situations in which this was likely to become an issue.  I could not see myself
dating someone while burdened by the constant anxiety of knowing that someday I
would have to reveal this information if the relationship is going to continue.
I know this is evasive to some extent, since avoiding such situations doesn't
insure that they won't occur.  I can't honestly say what I would do if I were
in such a situation, although I like to think I would find the courage to be
honest from the start.  I guess I'm lucky in knowing that I won't be in that
situation at all.
The other side of the coin is how would I feel if I were going with someone who
revealed to me that he tests positive.  I have a close friend who is positive, 
so I know I can be with someone who's positive without freaking out (which is
not to say I have no anxieties, but only that they're quite manageable).  Thus,
if someone with whom I was forming an emotional attachment turned out to be
positive, I think I would be able to continue the relationship.  I would
probably evaluate the relationship in the context of a sex life that would no
doubt have some restrictions, which could potentially be an issue.  But I 
learned a long time ago not to expect to have all my fantasies fulfilled.
(Reality is more than enough fun, anyway.) 
 
Sorry for being so long winded.

Choice b is not a wise choice unless they practice safe sex.  The accepted
thinking is that the various mutations of HTLV-3 do not infect in quite
the same way and that a cross infection might be all you need to go
from non-symptomatic to symptomatic (ARC or AIDS).

Thanks for this article; it is fascinating, if only preliminary
hypothesis. I have often wondered how women could pass on AIDS during
sex, if it is true that the virus is found in large quantities in
semen and blood.

I quote below an excerpt from an article entitled ""Prostitutes: victims
or scapegoats of the AIDS crisis?"" which appeared in the February 20,
1985 issue of _Windy_City_Times_-_Chicago's_Gay_And_Lesbian_Newsweekly_
(reprinted without permission):
     Male to male transmission of AIDS is well documented and because
     of this male prostitutes are a proven high-risk group.  However,
     the jury is still out on female prostitutes.  Female to male
     transmission of AIDS is not so well documented.  A recent medical
     study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female
     to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a
     risk.  The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-
     mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual.  That
     amounts to about 160 people.  The CDC also said that of the 160
     cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.
     Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of
     these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female
     prostitute to a client.
Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed
transmissions from female to male.  If experts in Africa have good
reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been
vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male
clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there
and here.  And the various mutilation practices and bloody religious
ceremonies sound worth investigating.

	The original article was a story about prostitutes in the 1800s having
their virginity surgically restored after each client.  How this could migrate

Or the apparent lack of female-to-male sexual transmission of AIDS in 
the US may simply be an effect of the virus' long latency and the
particular American subpopulations (gay males, IV drug users) that
AIDS has first reached.  Not long ago, some medical opinion doubted
that male-to-female sexual transmission of AIDS was possible or
very likely.
If semen is a vector, then the (visible) presence of blood isn't 
required for transmission.  Many sexual encounters cause some physical
trauma to tissue, & perhaps (microscopic) hemmorhaging.  The trans-
mission condition for most STDs is contact of mucose membranes.
I don't think many cultures in the rain forests or rift valleys of
central Africa, the possible origin point of AIDS, practice
cliterodectomy.
I still think that anthropologist Uli Linke's conjecture says more
about the psychology (anthropology?) of nervous Western populations
facing AIDS than it does about the disease itself.

	AIDS AND FEMALE CIRCUMCISION
""	Uli Linke's letter (17 Jan.,p.203) about AIDS in
Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse
may be an indirect consequence of the African practice of
female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare form
of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is
found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the
region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in
its social and biological effects from the kind of female
circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa.
	A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing
that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that
in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as
it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as
female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector.
I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining
to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena
as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to
marriage and family life.""

Considering that 1/3 of all prisoners have a history of drug use and

I have some Gay friends who have been arrested in Toronto Ontario.  When word
got around that they were Gay, they were subject to a lot of violence in
prison -- something to the order of -- ``he's gay, so it is fine to gang rape

Why is quarantining someone with the ability to transmit a fatal disease
the ability of someone being able to transmit a fatal disease a lame
excuse?  I keep reading things that say, in effect ""why do anything about
people infected with the virus since the they may not develop aids?""  The
point that is missed with this idiocy is that most people are not opposed to
individuals walking around with fatal conditions, but rather to individuals
walking around who can give them a fatal condition.  I know of no one who
thinks heart patients, emphysema patients, etc. should be quarantined, even
though the may drop dead at any moment, because their afflictions cannot harm
others.  Nevertheless, many states restrict people with active tuberculosis
from holding certain jobs, and restrict people with untreated epilepsy from
perfroming certain task, because their afflictions can harm other people.
If AIDS was not contagious, or if people with full blown AIDS were not
contagious, society would probably be a lot less concerned about people
with AIDS walking about.  But the odds are that anyone who tests positive
to HTLVIII is infectious, and possibly more infectious than individuals
who are symptomatic.  Therefore whether an infected individual ever actually
comes down with AIDS or ARC is beside the point to society at large. 
Studies in some prisons have shown that much less than half of the inmates
have been exposed to the virus.  Although it may be unfair to make someone
who sells heroin spend a few years (or maybe months, giving sentencing in this
country) alone because he has been infected, it doesn't seem as unfair as
sentencing another inmate to death when he is gang raped by one or more
infected individuals.  When you commit crimes one of the chances you take is
that you will be deprived of some basic freedoms - one of those freedoms being
the ability to murder by infecting other people with your fatal diseases.

Although some people might claim that all homosexuals, whether criminal or
not, are equal, I am astonished to see someone purporting to be pro-homosexual
make this claim.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to sort out
people for death and slave labor.  Admittedly the ACLU and their ilk would
like the rest of us to believe that we are either on the verge of, or
have slipped into, the horrors of fascism in this country, but we are 
thankfully a long way from it.   It is an insult to those who died under
the Nazis to equate their ordeals with the inability of convicted criminals
to dress as they want.

It's an extremely lame excuse.  It is a breach of someone's fundamental civil

Garbage.  There is *no* proof or evidence to show that anyone who tests HTLV3
positive is infectious.  There is evidence to suggest that those who test HTLV3
postive have between a 10 and 15% chance of being diagnosed with one or more
of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS within 5 years after
testing HTLV3 positive.  Pretty low odds!  This *fact* is not beside the
point.  It has further been shown that HTLV3 is *very* difficult to transmit,
and that it probably requires multiple exposure to get the retrovirus.

What crime has someone who is infected with HTLV3 committed?  If you mean to 
imply that all HTLV3 exposed people are homosexual, and that homosexuality
is a crime, you are wrong.  Not all HTLV3-positive people are homosexual
men.  Fact.  And consensual acts between adults are not illegal in many states,
and for that matter, a lot of what goes on between heteros is statute illegal.
That you think that anyone who has committed a crime is to be deprived of the
basic right to life, you are one sick puppy.

Wrong.  The Nazis used pink triangles specifically to single out homosexuals
in concentration camps, just as they used stars of david to identify Jews and
cirles to identify ""intellectuals.""  Everyone was at risk for death in the
concentration camps.

We're not talking about the right of people to dress in their Calvin's in
prison.  We're talking about the singling out people for the soul reason
that they may be infectious, they may be homosexual, they may be diagnosed
with AIDS/ARC.  There is nothing to support any of those contentions in
being diagnosed HTLV3 positive.  There is no relationship between HTLV3
and one's sexuality, gender, race, color, creed, religion, eye color,
national origin, IQ, or food preferences.  NONE.  Viruses don't discriminate,

Hey, Ken --
	You know a lot of kids go through that, and it means that
that they are neither homosexual nor transsexual.  How old is your
son?  My younger brother, when he was about 5, cried when he found
out he couldn't have a baby.  He's eighteen now, and about as
heterosexual as they come.  It just happens as children grow up
that they start feeling curious about the other sex.  There's nothing
at all to be concerned about.

	I am assuming that you are not serious here, about much of 
everything.  You know as well as anyone else here that a woman or
women in a boy's life does not turn him into a woman.  If you are
really encouraging sadistic behavior like this from your children,
I feel terribly sorry for them to be under your influence.   Still,
I would make it a strong bet that you weren't serious.

Fact:  when I was a child, being brought up by two happily married
       heterosexual parents, I was told there was nothing wrong
       with being gay.  I never questioned that, and I still don't.
Fact:  my father's best friend, a man I grew to deeply love and respect,
       was gay.  He never once tried to pick me up, counsel me into being
       gay, or anything else of the like.  He recently died of AIDS at
       age 49.
Fact:  a regular babysitter for me and my syblings was a lesbian.  She,
       too, never tried to influence me or my sister or my two brothers
       into being gay.  In fact, it was not until recently that I learned
       she was a lesbian (I'm 23).  She, too, grew very close to me
       and my family.
Fact:  I am and continue to be heterosexual.  So are the rest of my syblings.
In other words, environments permissive toward homosexuality do not
necessarily encourage it.  I have never felt any need to be gay,
nor am I likely to.  Do not worry about your son.  Encouraging
""masculine"" behavior as described above is likely to do a lot more
harm than good.  This is a great opportunity for you to tell him
about the difference between sexes -- it's a good lesson for him
(I am assuming he is quite young by your references to the cartoons).
I don't know what ""keep chargin'"" means, but I return to you the 
same greeting.

	""The groups at highest risk for infection have become 
	increasingly well defined; they include homosexual and

An old posting of mine listed them and their stages of trial.
	There are a few problems:
	1. Selectivity is a relative term -- these drugs are incredibly 
toxic.
	2. Once the virus has become resident in the cells of the immune
system, ReverseT becomes dispensable.
	3. There is so far little demonstration that stopping the spread of
the virus actually improves the clinical disease.  Consider the trial in
France with Cyclosporin -- the virus disappeared in the two weeks prior to
the Press conference AND all three patients died in the week following.

While this reply posting is quite informative, part of what is stated

From the document, ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 100 Questions

Dr. David Axelrod, M.D. Commissioner, dated October 24,1985, the following
excerpts are extracted without permission.
""Who is at risk for AIDS?
During the five years in which AIDS has been recognized and studied,
approximately 95 percent of AIDS cases nationally have occurred among the
following groups of people:
73% - sexually active homosexuals and bisexual men *WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS*
      (emphasis are mine - A nurse with the State Department of Health involved
       in the testing for the HTLV-III virus anti-bodies stated, 'We now feel
       that we have done a disservice to many homosexuals by automatically
       placing them in the high-risk category.  The high-risk category should
       have included some consideration of the sexual practices of the
       individual not just the fact that they are homosexual.')
From a separate document included with the first named publication,
(and again reproduced without permission),
                   GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION OF HTLV-III
                            TRANSMISSION/TRANSFER
Reducing risk of transmission through altering certain sex practices.....
UNSAFE
     These activities involve tissue trauma and/or exchange of body fluids
which may transfer the HTLV-III virus or other microbes.  These practices
carry high risk:
     - Fellatio
          The swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,
       is considered a high risk.
     - Vaginal intercourse  (as stated in the original posting)
     - Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)
     - ""Fisting""
     - Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)
       (Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDS
       have been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it is
       not known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')
I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to
not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with
total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and
spread of the disease.  There is a State Health Department Hotline
(1-800-462-1884
), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.
Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the
N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons
who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus.  Testing is free
of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through
the use of a code system.  Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test
need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.
N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other
community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services
associated with AIDS.  In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more 
funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer.

I may be getting this confused, but was the Cyclosporin trial the one a
couple months ago that was controversial because the drug is usually given
to reduce the power of the immune system (when it is attacking the body
itself for some reason)?  There was a lot of press over the ethics of calling
a press conference to get fast attention instead of the usual route of 
journal publication.  If I am confusing this with another drug, then what was
the result of that?

This drug does not actually kill the virus, only keeps the virus's
DNA from reproducing. Therefore, it must be taken continuously.  Also,
it cannot fix any damages already caused by the virus.  The drug will
go into testing as soon as enough of it can be produced - probably around

  about another WWII hero, Lord Montgomery.  A new book, ""Monty at Close

  of the male gender, one Lucien Treub, who has, now that Monty's been
  dead for some years, decided to cash-in and reveal all.  He has letters,
  etc. to prove it.  What next? ""I Was Himmler's Boyfriend"" ?

  how gays had taken over the West Hollywood and turned it into the model

  American problems.  First, it seems that Mayor Terrigno is a trifle
  embarrassed over some unanswered questions about her finances.  As a
  result, another gay councillor, John Heilman, is trying to tip her out
  of her job.  Everybody is getting very heated.  The council have adopted
  a very Californian solution to this nasty state of affairs:  they have

sexual, more so than Hitler himself.  Militant heterosexuality, meaning as
well violent antihomosexuality, was a central part of Nazi ideology and
practice.  Chronologically the first target of Nazi mass violence after
Hitler was elected Chancellor in 1933 was Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute
for Sex Research in Berlin (Hirschfeld was one of the earliest gay
activists), which was sacked one night, its unique and enormous collection
of books on sex & sexuality put to the torch in a public bonfire.  This
incident proved to be a kind of model for subsequent Nazi raids and
victimizations.
The only high-placed Nazi that was homosexual or bisexual that I know of
was Goering.  Ernst Roehm, head of the equally violent & bigoted SA, a
rival to Hitler's Nazi's in the early 30s, was also homosexual or bisexual,
and was slaughtered with a few thousands of his followers one night in a
treacherous assault by Hitler.

digest it came from, so I'm posting to all original recipients for
this important clarification):
	From: Jamie Andrews <ihnp4!alberta!ubc-vision!ubc-cs!andrews>
	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Possibly, but nearly every pleasure involves some sort of risk.
Everyone who eats raw oysters runs some risk of being poisoned, and
everyone who likes driving at 100 on the Mass Pike runs some risk of
crashing.  Lest I be criticized for ignoring the social implications
of disease, societies make these decisions as well, and people die as a
result.
I don't think it's irresponsible, either from a personal or a societal
point of view, to review the risks involved---with the help of lists
such as the one recently posted to this newsgroup, the one that caused
all of the fuss---and decide that certain acts which could conceivably
lead to disease and death are worth some risk.  A rich, sweet, wet kiss
is the primary symbol of human romance, and I'll be damned if I give it
up.  Who cares about sex, even plants do that (:-)).

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight
====================================
Reuter
------
NEW YORK
	City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a
homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign.
	But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door
of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers
vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices.
	""It's a bad joke.  Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a
month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer.
	Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and
other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election
to a third term.
	""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get
away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers
by surprise.  After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court
by closing time.
	Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open
the bar Wednesday night.
	Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000
AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to
shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse.
	Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city
hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police
action to head off a possible protest.
Pretty strange, wouldn't you say?  It's the ole double-standard again:
straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are.  I bet that a higher
fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the
fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids.  But anyway... the other
thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying
that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids.  As if that's what we're
trying to do.  And of course there's also the assumption that straight people
never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false.  Actually,
this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but
the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer
to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex
practices remained commonplace even up until its closing.  It *does* boggle
my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there.
Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation
of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay
as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners
in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.  The herpes analogy
is pretty weak, since I doubt anyone would lift a finger, not to mention a
court order, if herpes were an epidemic in the gay community.

Of course, the recommendation to avoid exchanging bodily fluids only
makes sense if either or both haven't been absolutely monogamous for the
past 5 or 6 years.  But even today's good boys and girls might not have
been in such a covetable position for that entire period--if one interprets
the recommendations strictly, even a single ""unsafe"" sexual experience since
1980 is enough to no longer feel 100% assured.
While I think it's great to be monogamous if that's OK with you two, it's
also pretty obvious that these recommendations are directed towards those
who haven't been practicing monogamy.  And that includes a lot more than
those whom you would call promiscuous.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not
having sex with them.
Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most
likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS.  That simply isn't true.
It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.
Here is an overview of the guidelines to reduce risk of AIDS
for ***everyone***, male or female, gay or straight:
AIDS RISK REDUCTION GUIDELINES

 Another good source is the SF AIDS Foundation Hotline,
	 800-FOR-AIDS]
Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Without arguing too much about the appropriateness of cross-posting to
net.women (I can see arguments on both sides), I should mention that I know
Will, and his credentials as a committed feminist are impeccable.  I am
sure that he sent the message with the best of intentions--i.e., that
women, individually and as a class, should be informed about safe-sex
recommendations.  I found the tone of your article offensive in the
extreme, and a total overreaction.  There are far more polite ways of
suggesting that a subject be discussed elsewhere.

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted

you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed

actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never

Cheryl, get over it.  Whether you like it or not, AIDS is a disease
that affects everyone, even you.  Will, and I, and Jeff, and anyone
else who post information about AIDS, are simply trying to provide the
latest information so that we can all be around in a couple of years
to keep on trading insults.  Will's information is not from the
*Post*, rather from the latest medical information currently
available.  As for sending this posting to net.women, you may be
right--Will should have posted it to net.announce and net.general.
And stop posting to net.nlang.africe. The topic is inappropriate for
that group. take it out of your newsgroups list if you want to
continue flaming.  Or better yet, let's take this off-line and into
the mail.

The blast you originally sent out was hardly a mere expression on
your part that sex was ""inappropriate"" as a ""primary topic"" in a

of it as a secondary or any other order of topic.
So the attempt at humor (directed at Jeff Winslow) was pretty hollow.

These kind of remarks are uncalled for.  This guy was making a genuine point

	NO. That is the way *you* are made. Not me. It is not up to you to
decide what is fulfilling or not. How can you say? You're not
me. Not everybody has the same requirements. We are made in many forms. The
body and the spirit and the potential and the mind. All these things determine
the protocol fulfillment. Do not project yourself on me. Some people can be
fulfilled without ever having sexual relationships at all. So what? One finds
what is right for one. Maybe you are projecting your own self- hate upon
us. Your method of communication seems indicative of that since, for the most
part, your messages are vulgar and insulting and tend to leave a person
with a very disagreeable opinion of you.
	I personaly have nothing against heterosexual people, and do not
classify them as cave people.

	You are you to reject any notions. Could you have rejected the pull
to heterosexuality? Homosexuality is *natural* for us (as per one of my
last postings). It's not even a pull. It is part of what I am, like being
Chinese.
	Why should I have to justify what I am? God made me this way, and
it is part of what I always have been, just as being heterosexual is part
of hwat you always have been. I have to justify moral decisions, but being
homosexual is merely part of my state; it was not a moral decision.
	Being gay is definitely *not* the easy path. Dealing with predjudice
from people like you make it difficult sometimes. But honesty is among
the highest virtues, therefore I choose to live what I am instead of
conform to what others would want.

	You are in no position to reject such a claim. What fulfills you will
not fulfill me, and what fulfills me will not fulfill you. So what? Big
deal. Not all people are the same. My relationship with my lover is quite
fulfilling, and you are in no position to say it isn't. You can't be,
because you have no idea what it is to love him like I do. And I am being
honest. I do not play mind games. I sometimes think you are, though.

To live a Gay lifestyle in the current culture, is to be exposed to
homophobic attacks on a daily basis. This electronic medium affords 
many otherwise shy  people  an opportunity to confront the source of
their opression without fear of physical reprisal. 
Being dissatisfied with the tone or content of a newsgroup is a good reason
to unsubscribe, and I heartily reccomend you do so if you don't like 
what you read. You can even take your ball(s) with you when you go.
I suspect that your threat to leave if others don't conform to your
plan for net.motss  will elicit more negative reaction than positive.

The December 1985 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has an article by Jeffrey
Laurence on ""The Immune System in AIDS"", pages 84-93, the magazine's
first real coverage of the subject of AIDS.  Up to now, it's neglected
AIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it.  The article's
bibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.
The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by Michael
Chaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US.  (It contained an item I
found interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) was
imprisoned because he is gay.  Years ago on PBS I'd seen his most
famous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike tale
about the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the eastern
Carpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I've
ever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)
SEX & SCIENCE
The current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,
""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviews
research on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the often
homophobic presuppositions of researchers.  Much of such ""science"" begins
with an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviation
in a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.).  So
what else is new?  What's new is that biotechnologies capable of altering
the gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in the 
not-too-distant-future.  The social implications of this were briefly but
sharply debated in net.motss months ago.  To me it's the most intriguing
issue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.
Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but their
accompanying superstitions about homosexuality.  Even some scientists
have succumbed.
Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles of 
explanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biology
essays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality.  Like
Marxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely to
justify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used to
support almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation.  Never-
theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examine
possible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""
(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,
is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biological
considerations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)
Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIAL
TOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):
	[ Quoted without permission. ]
    In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality first 
    began to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumed 
    that homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only on
    whether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal range
    of human variation (Hirschfeld).  The triumph of psychoanalytical
    approaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonment
    of this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959
    G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible genetic
    significance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-
    philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration of
    Certain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST
    93 [1959]: 81-91).  In the 1970s a great deal of speculation has
    followed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of it
    agreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-
    sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another.  A theory
    based on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-
    sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-Offspring
    Conflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64).  In 1975 E. O. Wilson
    (SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggested
    that homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, through
    which gay people benefit those closely related to them and offset
    their lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44, 
    and esp. 555).  This argument was expanded and simplified in ""Human
    Decency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.
    38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.
    The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,
    examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-
    ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:
    The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-
    Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: Some
    Evolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976).  An
    extraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biological
    approaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in John
    Kirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""
    Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.

the following cover phrase, a snippet of yellow journalism and homophobia
disguised as heartwarming news for the concerned straits:
	""Contrary to what you you've heard, AIDS isn't a threat to the
	 vast majority of heterosexuals or a peril to humanity.  It is --
	 and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can pay
	 for anal intercourse.""
Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with some
pretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication and
transmission which reads like it came out of a different article without
an axe to grind.  There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant than
the editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.
It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressed
against nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantle
of bioscience rather than religion.  But it was bad religion, and so far,
it remains bad science.
The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infection
or dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to the
anus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viral
infection.  These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continued
exploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official has
ever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off as
established fact.  It is interesting that this article comes out at the
same time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexually
active heterosexuals in Africa.  This article discounts whatever earlier
had been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice of
scarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles.  Why
promiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidence
of the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.
The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourse
and should not be identified as one and the same.  It was safe for millions
of years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backed
homophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex in
general) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.
It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as the
culprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence.  Rather, the focus
was on the spirochete.  Yet here we have a curious fascination with and
condemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society.  Right
now all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/or
semen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentially
dangerous.  At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals or
gay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid taking
reasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.
I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I am
not being misinterpreted.  My thesis is that there is a large political
component in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with the
traditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity in
general and anal intercourse in particular.  Whatever data might have been
or might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology of
AIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading to
overeager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on the
act of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreaded
syndrome.  To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to the
AIDS problem, this is very frightening.
With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses on
the role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to be
controversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalence
towards them.  But for me, this argues for even more careful reporting
and an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific mores
and morals.  The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.

a physician claim that the rectum is so hostile an environment for
microbes that the only STD pathogens which can survive in it are
gonococci.  Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via anal
intercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.
(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-
mitted only through ingestion.  Yet the urethra, vagina, and anus
are fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurk 
there.)  Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.  
If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually reside
in the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injection 
into the blood stream.  Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being 
""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or the
mouth for that matter.
Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whether
viruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear.  On the
other hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)
and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting from 
missionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-
tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men).  I've always
marvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-
clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contra
naturam,""  unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.
If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded belief
that AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it should
be noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypical
period such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)
intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, anal
intercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among both
straights and gays.
Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,
AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the interviewees
that AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""
for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the rest
of the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.

Newsgroups: net.motss,net.med
Well, here's a hastily reproduced editorial that appeared in this
morning's Boston Globe (11/14/85); I don't know how accurate it is.
Sexual transmission of AIDS in Africa is virtually entirely hetero-
sexual, a point the editorial fails to make.
Here's the full text of the editorial (from page 22):
""The worst news is yet to come about AIDS.  Even as the American public
takes some reassurance from the limited transmission of the diease here,
reports emerging from some African countries are ominous.""
""Coupled with a newer understanding of the AIDS virus as an insidious
infection of the brain as well as the body [varying degrees of dementia,
resulting from brain damage, have been found among up to 1/3 of US AIDS 
victims, especially during the disease's final stages], the reports make
the disease even more calamitous."" [This is an exaggeration: the AIDS
virus' affinity for nerve cells has been suspected or known for at least
a couple of years, and the findings on dementia have been out for half a
year or more; this isn't new information].
""What had been suspected in central and east Africa now is confirmed:
AIDS is rampant.  One-tenth of the residents are infected by the virus;
at least half will become sick.""  [Whether ""sick"" means ARC only or full-
blown AIDS, it didn't say.  At most 10% (at least, a fraction of a %)) 
of Americans carrying HTLV-III are expected to eventually contract full-
blown AIDS; the much higher ratio projected for Africa is attributed to 
poor health and sanitary conditions, certain folk practices involving
blood, etc.]  
""They number more than 10 million people, five times as many in the
far more populous United States.  There is less reason to think the
spread of AIDS can be slowed in Africa, although it may be in the
United States.""
""Last summer, two American medical scientists Drs. Bruce Johnson and
Charles Oster of the Kenya National Research Institute, expressed
anxiety over the heavy seeding-in of the AIDS virus.""
""Blood donations indicated that a 10-15 percent of Kenya's population
carried the virus.  A blood screening of 90 Nairobi prostitutes showed 
that half were infected and that 3 out of 4 [of those infected] had
symptoms.  A sampling of the 250,000-member Turkana tribe showed that
two out of three were AIDS-positive."" [Ie, had positive responses to
bloodtests for the suspected AIDS virus.]
""Although Kenya lists only 3 official cases of AIDS, the doctors
had heard through colleagues that a lethal new sickness was wide-
spread in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.  They fear that it is only
a matter of time until it moves into Kenya and other countries.  It
is known as the `slim disease' because its victims waste away and
die.  The doctors suspected it was a new form of AIDS.""
""They were right.""
""Now reports in the British medical journal The Lancet show that slim
diease is an African version of AIDS.  Its spread into Uganda--both
to rural villages and the capital, Kampala--is linked to traveling
traders and troops from Tanzania, which borders on the south.  The
prostitutes tested in Nairobi were migrants from Tanzania, where
nothing is known about the status of AIDS.""
""The AIDS outbreak is no less dismal in Rwanda and Zaire.  As early
as 1983, a higher rate of acute AIDS cases was detected in Zaire's
capital city, Kinshasa, than in New York or San Francisco.  In
Rwanda AIDS cases in children are 15 times higher than in the 
United States.""
""Up to half the hospital beds in Kinshasa are reported to be occupied
by AIDS-infected patients.  Twenty percent of the pediatric beds in
Kigali hold children with slim disease.  Since the AIDS virus can be
passed from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the
high birthrate in Africa compounds the AIDS problem.""
""In Africa, as in Haiti, AIDS occurs almost equally in men and women.
The disease seems to be spread in the same ways that it is in the US
-- sexually and through contaminated blood.""
""Opportunities for transmitting the AIDS virus in Africa are believed
to be enhanced, however, by certain practices.  Injections are commonly
given by folk-medicine practitioners who reuse unsterile needles.
Cutting the skin is another folk-medicine practice, and the blade is
reused.  Tribal circumcision rites, piercing of the ear, nose and lip,
and ritual scarring are often performed under unsanitary conditions.""
""Beyond that, the miserable overcrowdedness `in which the bulk of the
people live, combined with a high frequency of infections, injuries
and sores which break the skin, make blood contact among family members
practically inevitable, with the transmission of the virus likely,'
says Dr. John Seale, an AIDS specialist and researcher in London.""
""In an editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Seale
emphasizes the singularly dangerous threat posed by the AIDS virus over
the next decade, as a `slow, irreversible and cumulative' brain infec-
tion.  Bescause the virus persists for life, `it would produce a self-
sustaining epidemic.'""
""`Indeed,' wrote Seale, `it would produce a lethal pandemic throughout
the crowded cities and villages of the Third World of a magnitude un-
paralleled in human history.  That is what the AIDS virus is now doing.'""
[According to Dr. Seale, that is.  The neurological effect of AIDS is
not new information; I haven't heard such apocalyptic predictions from
other AIDS researchers.]

the desperate need to find an effective treatment and making urgent

I recall recent comments by Soviet officials about how the USSR has
nearly solved the problem of health care for the masses.  If Reagan
isn't receptive to the AIDS situation,, perhaps we could get the Soviets
to divert some of their resources from their Star Warski military buildup
to AIDS research.

I would be interested in a proof on how gay sexual behaviour is self-
destructive. I engage in it with my lover, and I have found that it is
constructive; the physical act is only one aspect of it. I guess I don't
believe in sex, only making love. A bonding occurs (or should, in my
opinion) when such an act is performed. I'm afraid that Mr. Ardnt is the
one who seems to lack understanding of what the act is all about.
He also evidences a lack of understanding in what exactly occurs in
homosexual acts.

I'd be interested in a proof demonstrating that it is a perversion. Such 
behaviour occurs elsewhere in nature (it's been observed in marine mammals
and avian species among other). And who is he to say what sexual fulfilment
(or fulfullment, as he says)is anyway? What may be fulfilling for him may not
be for others. I'm afraid Mr. Ardnt lack the quality of empathy.

Again, can he prove his assertion? Anal intercourse is not the only way to
communicate the disease, and it may not be the only factor. The condition
of the immune system at the time the virus is introduced to the body may
be a factor as well.
Mr. Ardnt makes many assertions, but I think the proof for the, if it exists,
is flimsy at best. It is nice to see something written by him which is
halfway decent though. That's nice.",g9t8pGWN0fIJ,2,1985-11-16,11,3

But the half-hour NBC News program at 11:30 pm, ""AIDS Fears, AIDS Facts""
really stunk.  Designed to allay the fears of an anxious public that
knows little about AIDS, it probably maintained if not increased their
anxiety level and stimulated them into thinking more about ""curtailing""
civil rights and liberties.  Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-
fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchers
and administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)
were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given the
purported fear-allaying aim of the program.  For example, when asked
a fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical's
Haseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, with
no further qualification or explanation!  Worse: liberal Henry Waxman
(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding and 
civil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed in 
replying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honored
basic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:
Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualification
or comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurd
proposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe it
or not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by law
to carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III.  Why the
odd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone
& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailment
of rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocates
of such measures are available, I don't know.  NBC News seems to be
in the throes of an AIDS hysteria of its own.
So it seems we still must monitor not only the media but even would-be
medical and political supporters for AIDS coverage and lobbying.  Groan!
Why is this country so f*cking wierd these days?  No international body

I thought the handling of physical contact between the lovers was quite
weird, too, although I was expecting even more sterility.  As it is, one
could ""read between the gestures"", as if they were deliberately suppressed
for the camera.  A bit more convincing than ""Consenting Adult's"" gay-person-

Consider  how  a  surgeon  prepares  for  surgery.   Thorough  scrub   with

This brings up some questions which, as a regular blood donor, not in a
high risk group, have occurred to me.  I know that the blood banks are now 
testing donor blood.  I can see the reason for that.  However, the test is 
often wrong.
If my blood tests positive, will they inform me about it?  If so, how?
Who else will be informed?  (An especially interesting question--since
I give through a program at work.) Must I pay for the extra tests to confirm 
or invalidate their positive test?  It seems to me that if their test was 
mistaken, I shouldn't be made to pay. (Beyond being scared shitless, of 
course!  I have visions of thousands of people sueing them for pain and 
suffering.)  Suppose I test false positive--can I be reinstated as a blood 
donor when the incorrectness of their test is confirmed?  I would like to 
give blood if possible--but if they don't want my blood, even for an invalid 
reason, do I have any recourse?  Or, if they act badly, should I even care?
As an aside, it seems to me that there are some issues connected with these
tests on which straights, (or bi's like me) should really be siding with
the gay community--like who gets told about your positive test, and how
society treats you (i.e. keeping you out of school or work).  Obviously,
given the information quoted, this could happen to anyone.  And it is most
likely, with a false positive, to happen to those people who care about
others enough to give blood since they will be tested often.  Given the 
irrational, lynching attitude I've seen, this could really mess up a person's 
life.  And of course, it's even worse with a true positive, because you need 
support even more in that situation.  But I don't see people caring.  I 
wonder how many people will have to be hurt before people do care.  Sigh.

list of the only kind of people who can get AIDS, is a giant step
toward the truth.  You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is
near collapse.  These people were exposed to the virus and their
resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the
carrier state.  PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG!  The ""incubation period"" is just the
carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough
for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do
with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word.  In this
sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people
with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until
something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again.  If
the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)
instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.
 
Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots
more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered
enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.
It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human
animal:  it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or
disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in
perception is tried.
There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned
every week.  The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS.  As I 
stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all
sides):  Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,
practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps
20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,
Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's
Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of
specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic
Systemic Candidiasis, etc.
There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone
into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by
following what I have reported to you above.  There is still no
conventional treatment that has any significant positive results.
What harm is there to try?  There can not possibly be any harm &, even
common sense says it should help.  Why so much resistance?  Any one
who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in
this area.  I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change
their lifestyle.  Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an
admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you
got it, helped you get it.  That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone
to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.
The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.
There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic
understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the
present outline I've been sharing with you.

says, it can't hurt and may be helpful.  The only reservation is for those
who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such
""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, and
hence drop other precautions.  For some gay men, this means once again
indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange
of fluids which may contain the virus.  This is imprudent, to say the
least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine.  This is the only reason he
is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of
exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.
One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now
dying of KS.
The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system
directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves.  There is no evidence
that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of
infectious disease, despite his confident assurances.  He is dealing in
black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still
poorly characterized line of susceptibility.  There is only one black and
white fact on which we'll both agree: don't come into contact with the
virus (exposure to blood, semen and serus products) and you'll never have
to worry about AIDS.

Sorry I can't provide references; this is drawn from conversation with
my internist, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  He
believes that the number of AIDS cases will grow by many orders of
magnitude in the next few years, and that it may wipe out much of the
third world where sanitary conditions are bleak.  His descriptions of
society after the plague becomes established sound like science fiction
post-holocaust stories (towns which become armed camps where strangers
may not enter, wholesale lynchings of homosexuals, mass hysteria).

 This is NOT true! AIDS antibodies have been found in two health-care
 workers who accidentally stuck themselves as described above. Neither
 of these people belongs to any of the ""high-risk"" groups for AIDS. This
 does NOT mean that they have AIDS - it means they have been exposed to
 the virus. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of those exposed
 to the virus will actually ""come down"" with AIDS.

Sorry to confuse things even more, but there has been ONE documented case
of a ""health care professional"" (to use the standard buzzword) who contracted
AIDS by sticking him/herself with a needle used to draw blood from the patient.
Actually, there have been rumors of a second such occurance in Britain, but
nothing I'd stake my reputation on.  Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very
high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail
to me and I'll go look it up).
Incidentally, my mother is a social worker who regularly sees AIDS patients
without bothering to gown up or wear masks or any of that other rubbish.

	There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the
United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so
probably didn't get AIDS through work.
	The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with
a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal
needle stick.  She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after
the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to
determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for
Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and
ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one
can't say she ever had AIDS at all.
	The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more
facile from men to women than from women to men.  I swear I saw a reference
that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male
heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-
male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous
at the time.
	No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva
or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only
a small minority of people with AIDS.
	There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the
first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is
probably an infection in-utero).  That is probably the best indication of
the virus' relative non-infectability.

Recent reading: Harper's for October has a panel discussion on AIDS that
is one of the most coherent and intelligent presentations on the subject
I can remember seeing in the media over the past several months.
Some quotes:
Gary McDonald (AIDS Action Council): ``Look, I think the moment may have
arrived to desexualize this disease.  AIDS is not a ``gay disease,''
despite its epidemiology.  Yet we homosexualize it, and by doing so end
up posing the wrong questions.  There is no evidence to support the
notion that gay men in general are immunocompromised because they engage
in anal intercourse, despite the fact that semen itself may be immuno-
suppresive in some circumstances.  And gay men have been doing this for
centuries with no dire consequences.''
Mervyn Silverman (a consultant) (no joke): ``... And there are certainly
erotic and exciting sexual activities that do not entail an exchange of
body fluids.  Use your imagination.''
Ann Giudici Fettner (New York Native): ``Use your imagination?  What
kind of educational message is that?''
Mathew Shebar (Gay Men's Health Crisis): ``Margaret Heckler ... I call
her the secretary of health and heterosexual services.''
Along (alas) lines more typical of the media of the Republic, the
magazine New York for the 7th inst. purports to bear within its pages
``The Last Word on Avoiding AIDS''.  Some good material---a little
better than the Enquirer's coverage---particularly with regard to
catching the disease through casual contact.  On the other hand, as soon
as New York enters the bedroom things go a little haywire.  There are a
few choice nuggets: a sidebar labelled THE NEW SEXUAL ETIQUETTE advises:
``If you're a single woman, remember---no casual sex ever again,'' says
one expert. ``Know your partner.  Know whether he ever had a homosexual
experience or used injected drugs in the past eight years.''
One unworthy identified only as ``Kaplan of the Human Sexuality Program
at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center'' [ I assume he wears a
trenchcoat and introduces himself as ``Kaplan of the Center'' ] refers
to ``these high-risk people, these Typhoid Marys''.  It's possible he
meant this as a dish.  If he did, this is the only dish in the article.
The magazine is hardly worth dashing out and buying for the article in
question.  I myself bought it to get the show times for ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom'', a play which sounds oddly like the Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes remade for the Village.  A report of which, subject to
its intrinsic merit, the availability of tickets, and the fickle whims
of my fair traveling companion, may be forthcoming...

Thanks for bringing up the _Harper's_ article.  I've read it, and
excerpted it for some of the locals here at Sun.  It really *is* one
of the very best articles on AIDS that I have read.
I would also recommend to all readers of motss and your friends two
other magazines (both October issues): _The Atlantic_, and _The New
Republic_.  The _Atlantic_ article is labelled as ""How San Francisco
Coped [sic] with AIDS;"" the _New Republic_ article is titled
""AFRAIDS.""  Both are very sane, intelligent, informed articles on the
subject.  I can't say strongly enough that every person of whatever
sexual preference who has had more that one sexual partner since 1981
should read these articles (all three).  The _Harper's_ article is
especially good, in that it describes in great detail the history of
the disease, what the ""clinical"" meaning of the term is, and describes
how the retrovirus LAV/HTLV-II works.  It also discusses some issues
of burning concern to all oppressed people--like mass quarantine and
public policy.  The _ATlantic_ article spends much of its time
discussing how AIDS has affected San Francisco, and how it has shaped
recent public policy in SFO.  But it also discusses how it affects the
lives of the people who it touches.  There have also been recent
editorial articles on AIDS in the British news weekly _The Economist_.
I don't remember the issue dates, but I'm sure that there will be more
in the future.  _The Economist's_ articles give a uniquee will be more
in the future.  _The Economist's_ articles give a unique, European
perspective, that is quite intelligent.  I think they have the benefit
of distance from the tragedy to help them.  In any case, it appears
that the ""serious"" press has started to get serious now.  It burns me
up,though, that it took school children and Rock Hudson to get their
attention.

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

The problem:  Insurance is a form of socialism.  The purpose is to
spread the costs generated by one individual over the whole group.
ANY attempt to select out ANY higher risk subgroup is in conflict
with the basic purpose of insurance.  The inevitable result is a
reduction in the cost sharing and a lessening of the 'insurance'.
(Yes, I know there are differential rates based on various
tables, charts, etc.  The conflict still remains.)

Wrong.  You are correct only if the higher risk subgroup is either
denied coverage completely or assigned to a separate insurance pool.
Differential rates (based on risk factors) within the same insurance
pool in no way lessens the effects of cost sharing.  An insurance
company with a million customers could use so many risk factors
that no two customers pay the same rate.  Please explain to me
how this adversely affects cost sharing.
Of course, if the rates are so exorbitant that almost no one in the high
risk group will buy insurance, that is equivalent to denying coverage.

In a very simple way.  If I pay more than you do for insurance, then
I have greater expense than you do.  My costs are not perfectly shared.
While it is true that in our present economy there are differential
rates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true that
most of the time the people paying more for coverage are still
getting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only time
costs are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the same
amount without regard to costs generated.  Any thing else is a
compromise.  (This is probably a point that is not relevent
to the real world,  perfection is rare in it ...)
BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assigned
to a separate insurance pool.'  It would seem to me that the act
of segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting me
into a separate insurance pool...  Or are you saying that an insurance
pool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?
Let me try a different model for explaination.  The purpose of
insurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed.  If all
costs were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.
If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number of
people, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs added
based on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.
(So far, so good, I hope )  At this point I claim that the imperfect
sharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra that
an individual must pay due to risk factors.  Admitedly a very small amount
compared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one is
totaly uninsured.
The only way that I can see where this would not be true would be
the following.  If the definition of insurance is not taken to be the
sharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed cost
for some unknown variable cost.  Then it would not matter that the
costs were unequally shared.  The only important point would be that
there was a known rather than unknown cost.  The known cost could vary
by individual yet still be 'insurance'.  However, the underlying
mechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing of
costs over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definition
to be the best on.
(Sorry about the length of this.  I hope that by making one long
explaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds of
missunderstandings...)

WRONG - WRONG- WRONG!  As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount of
FICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have no
dependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spouse
who could continue to collect benefits after my death.  FICA Tax is the
same for all.  (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has no
bearing on this issue.)  FICA is a form of insurance.
Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.
Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping that
the insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal life
insurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to a
ripe old age.
And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have an
educated population in the future.  (No flames about the quality of
public schools today please!)  My school taxes are not any less or more
because I am single and have no children to send to school.  
I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 this
year) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires such
programs.  I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfair
when it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our social
services system and it is not about to be changed.  And while I strongly  
support the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-
tial in retirement benefits.
These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniform
without respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status.  Why then
should we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!
As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomes
a disease which affects the heterosexual population in the same
ratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affected
as often as males.  This is becoming the situation in 6 African
countries today.
I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than I
choose not to get married.

I misundersood your use of the term ""cost sharing"" in your first
posting.  You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"".  To
avoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes to
mean what you take it to mean.  
It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, is
the purpose of insurance.  The purpose of insurance for the customer
is the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost.  The underlying
mechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"".  It depends
on laws of statistics.  If there is an insurance pool with fixed assets
with one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis of
risk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to the
company will be predictable.  As a matter of fact, this predictability
deteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equally
among the customers.  An insurance company achieves the most
predictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordance
with the probability it will have to pay out.  Imagine if you will
a life insurance company run according to your philosophy.  Everyone
pays the same rate, regardless of risk.  All 90 year olds, terminal
cancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up.  Deny them coverage, you
say.  O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.
sign up, etc.  Your insurance company would go down the tubes unless
it limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.
Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, the
predictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to my
company, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportional
to perceived risk.

Because the insurance companies would go broke, unless all the customers
were comparable risks.  It ""works"" for F.I.C.A. only because FICA is
compulsory.

I don't understand your point.  I did not state my feelings about
AIDS or AIDS victims in any way.  I simply implied that private
voluntary insurance companies must take risk into account when setting
policy rates, or they will go broke.  That's an economic fact of life.
Feelings don't enter into it.  AIDS victims are no different than
victims of other highly fatal diseases, such as lung cancer, in this
respect.  The unfortunate prevalence of homophobia in our society
should not make you read it in where none is intended.

We have a difference in definition of terms and a difference in
what we see as the purpose of insurance.  The difference in terms
can be resolved by searching for common definition; the difference
in the percieved purpose of insurance will not change or go away.

For those of you not fortunate enough to live within his zone of
syndication, Arthur Hoppe is the political satirist in the San
Francisco Chronicle. He is usually on target & quite funny, but
sometimes (esp. lately) his sense of humor flags with his reaction
to the world around him. Unannounced & unpermitted, I forward for 
your examination his column for today (10Sep). I DO hope that only
ONE copy of this shows up at any given site & that it's legible;
this editor & I have had to throw away 3 of these already!!
""The New Lepers""
It was at a party. I had filled my glass at the bar and turned. Behind
me was a middle-aged man I had known for several years. I don't know
him well. We had talked several times. He is a gentle, soft-spoken
soul and I like him.
A month or so ago, I heard he had AIDS. I thought of calling or writing
him, but what do you say? And now here he was. He held out his hand. For
a fraction of a second, I involuntarily hesitated. Then, of course, I 
shook it.
If he does have AIDS, I can only pray that he didn't notice that flicker
of hesitation. I am deeply ashamed of it. I can think of nothing more
dishonorable than to fail to offer your hand to a dying man.
Only the day before, a dear friend who is a reasonable sort demanded to
know why ""the newspapers didn't print the truth about AIDS"" - primarily
about what a danger AIDS poses to the middle-class heterosexual community.
""I was at dinner the other night and we spent at least an hour talking
about nothing else,"" he said, and there was a hint of fear and anger
in his voice.
I tried to tell him that for the last couple of years newspapers have
gone out of their way to publish stories about AIDS and their message was
precisely the opposite: every recorded case of AIDS has been the result
of the virus being transmitted into the bloodstream either by contaminated
blood or contaminated semen. There is no other known way to contract the
disease.
I don't think he heard me. I don't think people are listening. I think
they are too unreasonably scared.
""The food's good,"" said a woman I know, talking about a restaurant she no
longer frequents because many of the waiters are gay, ""but why take chances?""
""My heart goes out to him,"" a mother was quoted as saying in a news story
about a young pupil who had AIDS, ""but I wouldn't feel right letting my
child be in his classroom.""
In San Francisco, city officials denounced as ""a cruel hoax"" notices
falsely claiming that AIDS patients would be quarantined in remote loca-
tions. Yet at least some gays took it seriously.
And rightly so. From most reports, gays are being increasingly evicted,
fired and ostracized as the disease spreads increasingly among them and
the heterosexual community becomes increasingly frightened.
It's no wonder gays refuse to give their names when taking tests for AIDS.
If I were gay, I wouldn't want my name on any list. There's not much harm
now, but if no cure is found and if the disease and the fear continue their
exponential growth...
I keep thinking about leprosy. We used to ring bells and shout, ""Unclean!""
when we saw a leper coming, or lock them up in deplorable colonies for the
rest of their lives. We knew that their very touch would make us lepers too.
Today, we have learned that leprosy is transmitted only through prolonged,
intimate exposure. We now call it ""Hansen's disease"" and treat its victims
as out-patients. They walk among us posing no more danger than a stranger
with AIDS.
I like to believe that the human race is getting better over the millenia.
Aftr all, that hope is our only chance of survival in a nuclear age. So 
I can only pray that we react more reasonably to an unreasonable fear this
time around.
Thus I'm afraid - not of AIDS, but of our reaction to it. Your reaction and
mine. And if a dying friend of mine reads this, I hope he will forgive me.
I'd like to shake his hand.

drugs (posted in net.motss).
I read the NY Native article from which Ray reported some facts that
illustrate a connection with recreational drugs (esp. poppers) and AIDS. 
The facts in the NY Native article carried a disclaimer (see below) that
renders them in my opinion inconclusive but highly suggestive of such a
connection:
	Unfortunately, most of the published epidemiological studies of
	gay men with AIDS were conducted several years ago, and had
	serious shortcomings. ... In the absence of recent, large-scale,
	well-conducted epidemiological studies, one may give a cautious
	hearing to the less ""scientific"" evidence, such as reports from
	those who have known many people with AIDS. Such evidence should
	be evaluated critically, though it may [or may not] actually be
	worth more than the quantitative ""data"" from a poorly executed
	survey.
DO NOT ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR HAVE STOPPED
USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT YOU CAN AVOID OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AIDS.
I have heard many, too many gay men make a dangerous
decision on which AIDS precautions they will and won't adhere to based on 
preliminary scientific findings, anecdotal information, scientific studies
heard second, third hand though non-medical media, etc.
Re: bruises and other red marks that make you paranoid about KS lesions.
    Maybe someone with more medical knowledge can verify the following.
    Whenever I see a red blemish on my body, my first reaction
    is to think ""Oh, god! KS!"" But I have learned to check a few things
    to keep myself calm.
 
     - Press on the blemish. If the red goes away, it's not a KS
     lesion. That's because KS lesions are similar to bruises.
     The color produced by a bruise (or KS lesion) is
     caused by blood that has seeped into damaged tissue and clotted.
     Pressing on the skin will not drive blood out with bruises (and
     KS lesions) as it does with other blemishes.
     - A real bruise (not a KS lesion) heals rather quickly. It goes
     from red (fresh blood in the tissue) to brown and soon fades away.
     For me, a bruise very rarely lasts more than two days, and goes
     through enough color change in one day to calm my frazzled nerves.
     I believe KS lesions hardly ever go away without such treatment
     as chemotherapy, and I believe they look a lot redder than your
     typical bruise because the tissue is highly damaged and the
     blood continues to seep into it.
P.S. Could all AIDS postings please be posted to net.motss and net.med?

contradicts the assumption that all it takes is a SINGLE exposure through
an appropriate vector, quite independent of the supposed state of one's
immune system.  The early people who got AIDS didn't necessarily succumb
because of late nights at the disco and lots of poppers--they got it
because they were sufficiently promiscuous that their chances of coming
across an infected person was very high.  Now that HTLV-3 antibodies can be
found in a significant percentage of gay men, at least in certain cities
like NY, SF and LA, it is simply imprudent, if not suicidally foolish, to
indulge in ""unsafe sex"" practices, even if you meet ""Mr. Wonderful"" today
and pledge monogamy thereon.
Sure, take care of yourself, get enough rest, and take Geritol.
But don't let that substitute for the simplest and most effective
methods of avoiding exposure to the virus.

have misunderstood my intention and I would like to clear up any mis-
conceptions out there.
The article described my feelings of disenfranchisement from straight
people at work, fear of AIDS, and unfulfilled dreams of forming a home
with another man. I believe these are quite common issues in the lives
of many gay men today. My intent was to document some issues that affect
my life on a daily basis in the hope of starting some discussion in net.motss
on them. I was interested in seeing how other gay men deal with those
issues in their daily lives and perhaps find better ways to deal with them.
The article was written in a personal style rather than in a more objective
and expository style, and I think that misled some net.motss-readers to
take my posting as a desire for support/sympathy. One heterosexual
man e-mailed, ""What a sad letter. I could sense the hurt over the phone
lines."" And a gay man e-mailed, ""But I just wanted to write ... and say
someone out there cares."" Oddly enough, there were NO follow ups posted

Well, I posted a brief folloup which got disseminated to at least a few
sites.  I can send it to you if you like.
Regarding disenfranchisement, I agree it can be a very strong feeling, but
the only way to deal with it in a business setting without changing jobs is
to simply grit your teeth and work past it.  That means different things to
different people, of course.  I just don't let it bother me: comes with the
(strait) territory.  To be absolutely clear, since Rob posted his message a
while ago, I am not alluding to overt discrimination or harassment, but
simply the feeling of not sharing in many of the heterosexual assumptions
which permeate the workplace.

Can you see two boys, with another boy on the side?  If not then what you are
objecting to is group sex, not bisexuality.  If this image doesn't bother you,
then what bothers you about the one you mentioned is the fact that there are
women in it.  If you're not attracted sexually to women, then don't get 
sexually involved with them.
Do you worry about more about your mate running off with another man or another
woman?  if you worry the same amount, then you are worrying about fidelity,
not bisexuality.  If your mate running off with another woman would offend you
more than him running off with another man, I suggest that you re-examine
your attitude towards women.

Yes, that's what happens when you get involved with married people.  It has
nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the people involved, only with
the nature of strong commitments like marriage.

Unless one is making a commitment to a particular person, why should one make
a commitment to a particular sex?  Ray, listen to yourself for a while.  Try
replacing everything you say in terms of race rather than sex and see how
racist it becomes.  If one is attracted to both blacks and whites (say), why
should one make a commitment to only ONE race?  that is simply stupid and
racist.  What you are saying is sexist!  is it ""walking both sides of the
fence"" to make love to a black man and a white man?  Beware of the fences
in your mind, Ray, they are the most dangerous...

I think you are wrong.  I think you might have had some very
unfortunate experiences with bisexual men, but I certainly don't think
you should judge all bisexuals from such a sample.  Furthermore, I
think that your attitude is very ""biphobic"" (and maybe even misogynist
depending on your reasons).  You have so far in your article equated
bisexuality with sexual promiscuity, group sex and infidelity, which is
what the heterosexual community equates homosexuality with.  How dare
you ask for understanding from your persecutors just to turn around and
prosecute another group exactly the same way you were persecuted!  YOU
of all people should know better.  SHAME ON YOU!!!!!

Obviously I didn't read what you said carefully enough.  However, I do
have a rationalisation for your real answer too (<-:):  Have you ever
been asked by one of your lovers whether you liked them or one of your
previous lovers better?  Didn't you think that they'd be sort of
offended if you replied replied truthfully that the other guy was
actually much more fun?  It seems to me that these kinds of questions
are never asked to find out the truth, but simply to be reassured.
Your 99 lovers simply sound very polite to me (did you actually make it
with more than 100 bi's? <-:) by giving you the answer you wanted to a
question they probably considered meaningless.   You sound so anxious
about bisexuality that I am not surprised that people gave you the
answer you wanted just to calm you down.  It really is NOT an important
issue.

Why should bisexuality imply non-monogamousness?
It simply means that one is attracted to folk of both sexes.
A permanent partnership could just as easily be formed by a bisexual and a
person of either sex as between two heterosexual or two gay individuals.
The issue is the same, it seems to me: it shouldn't be any harder for a
bisexual to ""give up [the sex not partnered with]"" than it is, for
instance, for a woman to abstain from taking other female lovers in order
to maintain sexual loyalty to the woman she is partnered with.

on-going  discussion  in  net.motss,  and in a follow-up, I agreed and
said I would post an article about personal issues in my life as a gay
man.  This is it.
After thinking,	I came up with three major personal issues  that  have
to do with my being a gay man on a daily basis.
   - feeling disenfranchised
   - AIDS
   - forming a home with someone
I feel incredibly vulnerable about what	I wrote	below,	but  what  the
hell.	I  feel	 most vulnerable in front of those people at work that
will read this but who I do not	know well  enough  to  talk  about  my
feelings with.
DISENFRANCHISEMENT
I  feel	 disenfranchised   as	a   result   of	  heterosexism.	   (By
'heterosexism'	I  mean	 an  unwitting	or  unconscious	 assumption on
someone's part that everyone  is  heterosexual	and  perhaps  leads  a
certain	type of	life, e.g.  marriage, family.)
The disenfranchisement	I  feel	 does  not  come  from	individuals  I
personally  deal  with,	 but  more  from  people at a distance or from
institutions.  For example, the	people at work who  I  talk  with  are
basically  not	heterosexist.	But the	words and actions of coworkers
who I do not interact with much, even professionally,  sometimes  make
me  feel  disenfranchised.   Just subtle things	in the way they	phrase
things sometimes.  Usually nothing so consciously anti-gay that, if  I
chose, I could challenge them about.
Nobody but me in our office openly gay that I  know  of.   No  one  to
REALLY	talk 'sisterly'	with.  There are a couple three	people at work
I can sort-of talk with	to in the way I	 would	only  normally	do  to
another	gay man, e.g. feeling comfortable enough to remark how nice it
is that	there are quite	a few construction workers around to  look  at
(the  building	is  half  unbuilt).   And  that	comfort	came only very
recently.
Sometimes I feel lonely.
AIDS
I don't	think there has	been a single day in the past year or so  that
I  have	 not thought about, worried about the threat of	AIDS.  The New
York Native (a NY-based	gay biweekly newspaper that is national	in its
scope of news) arrived today and a good	quarter	of its 60 odd pages is
about AIDS.
I will go to the gym tomorrow morning.	I will see  perhaps  a	little
bruise there or	a red mark here	and the	first thing that flashes in my
mind is	KS, even when I	KNOW that I ALWAYS get a little	 bruise	 there
from horseback riding, and that	I ALWAYS have had that little red mark
here ever since	I can remember.	 I will	effortlessly use the  exercise
cycle  for 20 minutes, but later in the	day when I return to my	office
from lunch and get a little winded going up three  flights  of	stairs
while  talking	at  the	same time, I wonder if it is pneumocystis.  On
Friday,	Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, will	come  out.   I
will  turn to the obituary column with morbid interest.	 There will be
half a dozen photos, mostly of gay men about my	age, some  of  whom  I
will recognize from the	neighborhood, from the gym, etc.  Infrequently
there will be someone I	knew  well,  a	person	I  once	 dated,	 or  a
roommate I once	shared an apartment with.
Do you think there's a chance Reagan will get AIDS from	the  blood  (I
presume) he got	during his polyp surgery?
Sometimes I feel terror.
HOME
I dream	of having a home life with another man on a gentleman's	 farm.
Something  small  but pretty.  A few animals - two horses, some	goats.
Something I think I could afford  with	another	 person	 of  the  same
means.
Another	gay man	who likes country living?  Another gay man  who	 likes
horses	(and  that's  not  just	 from  the  other  side	of the fence)?
Another	gay man	whose boots are	not just a part	of his	""cowboy	 drag""
when  he  goes out to the c/w bar on the weekend?  (And, god, he's got
to be intelligent, verbal, and introspective enough to get along  with
someone	 who  grew up in an upper middle class mainly Jewish suburb of
New York, who went to college for 10 years,  and  who  is  a  computer
programmer).
Sometimes I laugh!

I think this is a very common feeling among gay people, though how one
reacts to it depends on where it happens, how much you have learned to
artificially separate your personal life from your public persona, and how
sensitive you are to the kind of dissonance this produces.
It hasn't been a real problem for me where I work, except in one particular
instance which won't happen again: every year BBN holds a ""winter party"" at
a local museum with food, music and dancing, and last winter, the entire
company was invited.  Plans for my lover and I to meet up with other gay
and non-gay friends quickly vanished as I tried to find them among the
2000-odd people meandering around the six sprawling floors of the Science
Museum.  Lots of strangers, lots of people you wouldn't even want to talk
with even IF your lover weren't standing next to you, straight couples
EVERYWHERE, and my local support system nowhere to be found.  Aauuugggh.
After a few hours we left, suffocating from the thick cloud of
heterosexuality.  (I am sure I have just ""disenfranchised"" the straight
contingent here, but I'm telling it to you ""straight"", as it were.)

would be interested in the view point of a ""straight"" married female.  You
might be interested to know that we share some of the same views.  I have 
also been unhappy about the volume of postings to this net group.  What is
there tends to be of good content, but what struck me the most is I always
see the same names.  I am posting this via anonymous electronic mail for
two reasons.  I am new to the net and have just not learned how to post, and as
I am only working for the summer, it was not worth taking the time.  Also,
to be honest, I would hesitate to post to this news group because I would
not want anybody getting the wrong idea about me, even if I am married.  Of
course if anybody did, that would mean they also read this news group, right?
It will not be possible for me to receive any mail, as I am getting ready to
leave, but I probably still be reading the news group, so any public responses
(good or bad) are welcome.
	I am sure you wonder why I would be interested in your news group.
Some of you may think it is only a sordid curiosity.  I like to understand
what is happening around me.  The foreign friends I have had fascinate me
when they talk about their culture and beliefs.  In the same way your
culture fascinates me.  You live a life and emotions I do not understand, 
only because you are in a situation unlike any I have ever known.  The only 
close gay friends I have had were in high school, and still in the transition 
period where they had serious questions within themselves, so yours is a world 
completely unfamiliar to me.
	As for Ken Arndt, I know he attacks a very sensitive area with you,
but I really think it should not bother you.  In reading other news groups,
he is just as unpopular.  More than any other, he is openly insulted for his
view points.  Coming from anybody else, I can understand the agony it would
cause, but Ken is a sub-human life form with a pretense of human emotions.  I
was honestly surprised when he said he still loves you, and when are you going
to get together.  I would have been even more surprised if you had taken him
up on it, and would have assumed it was only to greet him in hostile numbers
with ulterior motives, but then that would be sinking to his level.
	One thing I would like to say, just as you might not like being
characterized as having a certain behaviour because you are gay, I too feel
slightly offended by the category you lump us in at times.  Remember, the
most hostile are probably also the most verbal.  Do you always have the best
of your group represent you?  On our campus the ""leader of the gays"" (self-
proclaimed, of course) was the local joke, and though I don't know this for
a fact, I suspect he only made things harder for some of the others.  It seemed
that every time he did not get what he wanted it was because he was discriminated
against for being gay.  This was believable the first time, but the fourth or
fifth time, the story got old.  Now, if I believed he truly represented all
gays on our campus, I would have come up with a pretty low opinion of them.
Instead, I chose to judge people on an individual basis.
	On the Jason on Bars article - I found it amusing.  It seemed to me
to be a cross between honesty and friendly humour.  It did not seem like the
article of a depressed resentful person taking his problems out on others.
I also learned something from it, as I have learned from all of the articles,
but I didn't take it as a verbatim narrative of a typical night at the bars.
It seemed the point was the emotions creating the actions, not a satire of
the gay whores.  The articles on the gay emotions have been much more interesting
than the rehashed stories on AIDS.  This is the only place I know that I can
find such honesty about the feelings and struggles of gay people.  Of course,
it would mean more if more people contributed.  I strongly encourage others
to take advantage of the anonymous postings.  It would also help if any body
who did chose some nick name, so multiple postings can be easily followed.
	Well, I know I have rambled on.  I hope this was taken in the positive
way it was intended.  If I have inadvertantly offended anybody, I apologize.
I am not aware of everything that is acceptable, ie - I didn't know 
homosexual was a derogatory term until reading this group, I always thought
the term gay was more insulting.

> You live a life and emotions I do not understand,

which got me thinking a bit about my everyday life, gay culture,
""gay emotions"", etc.  In a sense this is directed at the non-gay
readers of net.motss, though it's also an invitation for comments
from other gay people.
The issue of differences between gay and straight people is complicated and
multi-faceted, depending on the points you want to make and the method of
analysis you take.  I'm going to concentrate on what will seem almost
blatantly obvious and not worth mentioning to some, but subtlety often gets
lost in this discussion, so I'll forge ahead.  My thesis is, simply, that
there is no such thing as a ""gay emotion"" and that there are few
categorical emotional differences between straight or gay relationships.
This is no less true for committed couples, either cohabiting or married, a
form of relationship which is probably less affected by gay/straight
""cultural differences"" for the points I wish to make.  Right now I know a
*lot* of couples--my straight friends are all at that late 20's-early 30's
""marrying age"", and being in a long-term relationship myself, we've also
gained a lot of gay couples as friends.  I see the same joys, trials and
committment regardless of their sexual orientation.  You still have to take
out the garbage, still have to build a compatible living arrangement, still
can reflect on your partner sleeping next to you, still have to plan
together the life you both wish to live.  The emotions which bind a couple
together and which grow over time are identical in straight or gay
relationships.
I am not trying to dismiss the differences between straight and gay
relationships (which certainly are there: should make some interesting
followup discussion--hint, hint).  I *am* trying to emphasize the
commonality which comes, simply, from our shared humanity.

Ken, you should go to the Dr. and have your blood pressure and sugar
levels checked.  If that all checks out ok, have them do an EEG to
make certain there isn't a tumor.
All, please forgive my giving in to this.  I normally practice what I
preach: ""Treat the cause, not the symptom""; however, Mr. Arndt is a
very serious set of symptoms, and I fear for his health.  It is known
that such stress can lead to lessened disease resistance, and
ultimately defects in the Immune system...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]

  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

	HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen,  although they are a group
of proteins that occur on every cell in the body.  There are 4 groups -
HLA-A,B,C are found on every cell.  HLA-D is particularly prominent on
White Blood Cells.  There are hundreds of types of each letter - so many
in fact, that probably no two people on Earth (except identical twins)
have the same arrangement.  HLAs are also known as Transplantation antigens
-- they are the cause of Rejection following Heart/Kidney/etc. transplant.
	One of them -  HLA-D4 has been shown to react with the antibody to
the virus that presumably causes AIDS.  This is the first case of a true
False Positive with known cause.
	Therefore, people who carry the HLA-D4 gene will register a positive
result to the AIDS blood test, whether or not they have been exposed to the
AIDS virus.  However, it can be checked via other means.
	One explanation for the phenomenon is that the only cell line in
which HTLV-3 will grow carries the HLA-D4, and hence the antibody is raised
to a HLA-D4/HTLV-3 hybrid (also known as a virally-altered self) and then
will react with each component separately.

is a quick clarification.
	The Test checks for antibodies against HTLV3, also known as
AIDS Related Virus, or anti-HTLV3 antibodies.
	The article described the testing of anti-HLA antibodies (which are
normally used in tissue typing for transplants) and the discovery that one,
anti-HLA-DR4, reacted with anti-AIDS antibodies.
	I left out the 'anti's last time and here's where I made the boo-boo.
People who have the HLA-DR4 gene will not test false positive for HTLV3.
For them to have anti-DR4 antibodies would mean that they would be attacking
their own tissues.
	The only way someone would have those antibodies was if they had 
recieved a transfusion or a transplant or a skin graft from someone who
had HLA-DR4, or if there's still yet another cross-reacting antigen that
hasn't been described yet.
	I feel much better now.  Sorry for the inconvenience and confusion.

 BOSTON (AP) - A virus almost identical to the germ generally thought

  it will provide an important new tool for developing a vaccine to
  control the epidemic of the fatal disease.
    The latest discover also supports a theory that AIDS - Acquired
  Immune Deficiency Syndrome - began as a disease of monkeys and only
  recently spread to people.
    Scientists at the New England Regional Primate Centre identified
  the virus in macaque monkeys.  The animals were afflicted with
  monkey AIDS, a disease that mirrors AIDS in people.
    American experts believe that human AIDS is caused by a virus called
  HTLV-III, for Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus type three, and they've
  named the new monkey virus STLV-III, for simians.
    ""Clearly we have, for the first time, a virus that looks and acts
  like HTLV-III, than clearly can infect and be isolated from animals

    Scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health have discovered
  that the monkey AIDS virus appears to be common among a species called
  the African green monkey that lives in central Africa.
    ""We hypothesize that the African greens gave the virus to people

  10 to 50 years, said Dr. Max Essex, an AIDS researcher at Harvard.
    Although STLV-III is fatal to macaque monkeys, it apparently is not
  dangerous to the African green monkeys, which are a separate species.
  About 70 per cent of the green monkeys tested showed evidence in their
  blood of exposure to the virus, yet they were healthy.

It is a very very far cry from noting that nonoxynol-9 inactivates

an agent like this as an excuse to return to dangerous sex practices

It seems to me that they are opening themselves up for a good lawsuit

	AP) The Government has approved a sec-
	ond screening test for blood contam-
	inated by acquired immune deficiency
	syndrome, or AIDS, after laboratory
	results indicating it was the most sens-
	itive indicator of possible exposure to
	the disorder.
 	  Electro-Nucleonics Inc. of Fairfield,
	N.J., was awarded the second license by
	the FDA ....
About 2 months ago, I ran a series of four articles on HTLV-3, the virus
that most likely causes AIDS. I spoke of the screening test as highly
accurate, and then received mail and flames otherwise.
	Well, here is the source of the misunderstanding. There are several
tests - the most sensitive being the Western blot, which I was referring to.
(This was reasonable, since most Test-Positive results were to be redone
with Western blots before accepting the results.) It has an accuracy of
99.8% or so.
	The first licensed test had an accuracy of approx. 93%. Tests under
development range from 82-95.6%.  These all use a system called ELISA (for
Enzyme-linked Immuno- S? Assay) which is much easier to do than a Western
Blot (Incidentally, Western Blot is so-called, because the first person
to do ""blotting"" was E.M. Southern, so the blot was nick-named the
""Southern Blot"", and each new technique was given a different direction and
the name stuck.) ELISA involves add sample, add reagant, check color change.
	Anyway, this new test has an accuracy of 99.6% (4 false positives
in 1000 people)  which is not much worse than Westerns.
 
	AND, of course the usual disclaimer:  Although everyone with AIDS
has been shown to have antibody to HTLV-3, the reverse is not true.
The presence of antibody to HTLV-3 does not signify that a person has or
will get AIDS, but has merely been exposed to it or a cross-reacting virus.

Um, I've heard that a significant percentage of AIDS patients DO NOT
harbor HTLV-3 antibodies, and this bewildering state of affairs only
complicates the application of such tests.  Naturally, it isn't clear
in these cases whether the absence of antibodies reflects absence of
virus.  Does anyone have the original references?

5 February 1985.
	According to Friday's (2/1) USA Today, Bruce Voeller,
a biologist and president of the Mariposa Foundation, announced
results of a four-year study which showed that nonoxynol-9 may
prove useful in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus.
This study was done in collaboration with the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.  Voeller advocates that people use
over-the-counter spermicides that contain at least 5% nonoxynol-9
as sexual lubricants to lower their risk of contracting AIDS.

            This article doesn't come from discussions at gay rap groups
         but from my own experience and that of friends who I've helped
         deal with their breakups. I'm very happy for those who have a
         warm, loving relationship that is stable. I have found out that
         in the gay world this is a rare commodity indeed.
            I met Danny five years ago at a friend's Labor Day cookout. At
         the time I was unattached and Danny showed interest, so we talk-
         ed all through the day and exchanged the obligatory phone num-
         bers; promising to get together. I had a strange gut feel about
         the guy but couldn't put a finger on what it was. He was quite
         handsome, intelligent (or so it seemed) and charming; almost too
         charming as I remember.
            The following Friday my roomate and I had just sat down to eat
         when the phone rang. It was Danny asking if he could come over
         for a while. I asked Lauren if it was ok with him and he nodded.
         Lauren was just getting over the breakup of a very bad 2 year
         relationship with an alcoholic. He was at the party where I met
         Danny and also had funny feelings about him but wrote it off as
         just his own paranoia about getting involved.
            In four months I was very much in love and agreed to move in 
         with  Danny. Once I moved in; I started learning a lot of things
         that would have swayed my decision toward calling it quits with
         Dan. He knew what he was doing all right. He was on his best be-
         havior until he knew I was his. I first learned he had herpes
         from his brother whom I had become good friends with. His broth-
         er also told me about the pathological lieing, alcoholism, and
         psychotic episodes the family was target of. When I tried talk-
         ing to Dan about his brother and my conversations; he blew up!
         Dan told me that his brother was schizoid and had been put away
         for two years. He managed to convince me this was the truth so
         I avoided his brother for a while. I learned in time that every
         word his brother Jim told me was 100% fact.
            I would come home from work to find him quite drunk and in a
         nasty mood. Sometimes he would go out and not return for a coup-
         le of days, telling me it was none of my business where he had 
         been. He also made a point of buttering up most of my friends and
         attempted to do the same with my family; who saw through him
         from day one. Mom couldn't convince me that he was no good since
         my emotions had blinded my thinking. I was determined to make this
         relationship work and at times even Danny seemed to want to
         make an effort. His efforts were sporadic; one week he was kind
         and loving, the next impossible to live with.
            This went on for three years until I started losing my zest for
         just about everything. I started drinking more than I should and
         became moody. My performance at the office took a nosedive and
         I was warned to, ""Straighten up, or else!"" In my entire working
         career I had always been rated as an excellent worker. I knew
         that I was unhappy in the relationship but was afraid to break it
         off since Dan had threatened to cause mayhem if I did. He was
         always telling me how insecure I was; it was really him who was
         the more insecure. I made a conscious effort to remove myself from
         Dan while living with him. This gave me the emotional distance I 
         needed to make the important decision to drop out.
            Danny knew something was up with me. The day I decided to have
         the summit talks with him, he came home carrying flowers for me
         and champagne. I told him how I felt about all the shenannigans
         he'd pulled and that things would have to change. He flew into a
         rage, smashing the champagne bottle on the coffee table then
         stormed out of the apartment.
            Two days later I got a call from him. He was crying and begged
         to come back. Just for the record; this happened about once a 
         month, this time being the last. When he knew I was serious he
         threatened suicide. He came and picked up his things the follow-
         ing Saturday. Nothing was said between us and I thought I'de seen
         the last of him. Over the next few weeks I got quite a few
         phone calls from friends of mine telling me he had visited them
         telling about what a rotten person I was, about my psychotic ep-
         isodes and my alcoholism. He also called the office and told my 
         boss that I was gay and he was my lover. We had taken some Pol-
         oroids of us in bed when we first met. I never thought to look
         for them. I got a call from my mother who was very upset. You
         guessed it; he had sent the pictures to my mother. The guy was
         trying his best to ruin me before he left. The phone rang at all
         hours of the night with just silence on the other end. I called
         the police who just laughed about the two fags having a lover's
         quarrel. This went on for two months, until a friend of his drop-
         ped by to visit. He told me Dan left for San Francisco the day
         before and that he had many questions about Dan himself. We sat
         up until four a.m. and I learned a lot more about the character.
            I had met an ex-lover of Dan's once. I knew he lived in Boston
         and gave him a call. He was only too happy to have me over to
         talk. The story of his year with Danny was a carbon copy of what
         I was going through. After Dan finished trying to ruin Ralph, he
         hopped a plane for Chicago; two years before meeting me. Danny
         told me that he had always lived in Massachusetts when we met. I
         learned that he had lived all over the country, raising havoc with
         every life he touched, then moving on.
            That's one of my stories. It seems very similar to ones that
         friends have told me about past lovers. I swear there must be a
         factory somewhere in Detroit that manufactures these people.
         Now ole Jason will share some hints on how to recover from such
         an affair.
         * The two of you have had the same serious fight for the 175 th
           time, you've broken up 3 or 4 times and things always seemed
           to be better for a few weeks after you got back together but
           you don't feel like you can handle another round. Fine! it may
           be time to part company. If the guy is sane, then the two of
           you can shake hands, hug and fade into each other's history.
           You might even go on to become bosem buddies. If he's at all
           like Danny, read on.
         * If you fear that your lover may be violent when you break the 
           news that it's over, have a friend nearby who is willing to 
           take you in for a while. You may want to tell him in a semi-  
           public place where there are other people present; preferably
           not a bar.
         * Warn your friends that he may be dropping by to tell his tale
           of woe. If they're really your friends you won't be hearing
           what a hot lay he was from them. They probably will show him 
           the way to the door.
 
         * You may also be hearing from his friends after the breakup. Be
           very careful on the phone when talking to them; he may be lis-
           tening on an extension and trying to get the goods on you. Be
           polite but brief unless you really know his friends better than
           you knew him.
         * He may try to contact your family; giving all the sordid det-
           ails of the relationship. If you're not out to Mom, this may
           be a good time to come out gracefully to her,""Uh! Mom, you know my
           roomate Larry, weeeelllll there's something I've been wanting
           to share with you about him and I"". She's probably figured
           it out after visiting your one bedroom apartment anyway.
         * Once the bum's out get his keys back, then have the locks 
           changed. This is very important if your now, ex is anything
           like my Danny. It can ruin your whole day to come home from
           work to find only a lone coffee table in the living room, the
           one he smashed the champagne bottle on. Also have the phone
           number changed; preferably to an unlisted one. This will help
           keep harassment to a minimum via the phone. 
         * If you're afraid he'll call the office, it helps to be out to
           your boss. I was working for a woman at the time when I warned
           her about Danny calling. She told me that she had dated a guy
           much like Dan and that she'd take care of the twerp. What she
           did was cruel but I loved it. He called her as I feared he 
           would. My boss just said,""Oh really, uh huh, uh huh, well I'm
           sleeping with him now!"" She told me Dan hung up post haste. If
           you're not out to the boss you can always warn he or she that an
           escaped lunatic may call claiming to be God. It just helps to
           warn the boss that some slightly deluded individual may call
           and to ignore them.
         * Make sure all your valuables are in a safe place like at Mom's
           house when the shit hits the fan. Take inventory of all valu-
           able receipts, titles, bank and check books, etc and put them
           somewhere out of reach. Go see Mom again.
         * If he's left anything behind, don't throw it away for a while,
           at least until you're sure he's gone for good. He may be back
           looking for his stuff later and raise a real stink if you've
           canned everything.
         * If you own anything jointly, get an agreement in writing of who
           gets the property. You can only do this if the ex is rational
           and isn't carrying a gun. The same goes for money in joint
           savings/checking accounts. Better still, if the two of you hav-
           en't been together for an appreciable length of time, then
           separate accounts are a wiser decision. Users will usually press-
           ure you from the beginning to pool your resources; beware!
         * If he starts pleading to come back and you've been through the
           same melodrama with him before, be firm in letting him know
           it's over but don't threaten, ""If I see your fucking face ar-
           ound here I'll kill you"". This will only get the turkey upset
           and start him gobbling all the more. Try to let him think that
           there may be a chance in the future (like the year 2013) that
           the two of you may be able to make a go of it again. These guys
           don't handle rejection very well, much worse than the rest of
           us.
 
         * Another ploy he may use is the,""Let's just sleep together one
           time"" routine. It's wise to just say NO! With your jumbled up
           emotions, you'll probably take him back again for the 147 th 
           time and wind up where you started. Remember that this guy can
           probably read you like a book and play you like a piano. Being
           firm will let him know in a very short time that you mean bus-
           iness. You have seen through him and he's aware that others
           have also. He's terrified of going it alone again because he
           may not be so lucky landing another sucker in the future. He'll
           be forced to face himself and users don't want to do that; do
           they. Resist the Siren's song at all costs.
         * Well! you're all alone now in this big apartment, right! Take
           my advice and don't go rushing out to fill the void with an-
           other warm body. Nature abhors a vacuum and so do newly part-
           ed lovers. You're very vulnerable now and risk attracting an
           even worse turkey. These users/losers can smell an easy mark
           ten miles away and will try sweet talking their way into your
           life. It's now time for you to take stock of yourself. Chances
           are that when the two of you were together, you didn't have much
           time for yourself. Indulge in a hobby, call a long neglected
           friend over for dinner, take a night course, etc. The import-
           ant thing right now is to fill your time with things you enjoy
           doing. 
         * You may go through a period of promiscuity where you'll screw
           anything that stands still long enough. This is fine as long 
           as it  doesn't become a habit or depressing. Make sure you're
           not looking for the deep loving sex you had with what's his
           name while sowing your wild oats. Whoring around has become
           somewhat of a hazard with the advent of AIDS. If you don't
           feel good about being a slut for a while, then don't!
         * You may try getting involved with a gay social group if there's
           one convenient to you. This will offer you a non bar social
           outlet, unless the ex shows up; then go back home and watch
           Dynasty. Chances are that the ex will move off to places un-
           known; especially if he's like Danny.
         * Allow yourself to mourn the loss of a relationship. You've
           probably put a lot of effort into it and it's ok to feel bad
           even though the guy was a loser. After a while you may feel
           anger, even rage when you realize the ride you were taken on.
           It's ok to be mad. Call up a friend and let him know how you
           feel. If the bad feelings become obsessive, call a shrink if
           necessary. He'll let you be angry and might give you one of
           those foam rubber bats to smack the chair with in effigy to
           your ex.
         * I find that working with people who are hurting worse than me
           helps get my mind off my own loss. It might help to volunteer
           time manning a hot-line, visiting the elderly or doing volun-
           teer work with handicapped people.
         * Now is also a good time to stay away from alcohol and drugs.
           They may make the hurt go away right now, but only prolong it
           in the long run.
 
         * If you've had a continuous track record of Dannys, then it's
           now time to do some serious soul searching into the reasons
           that you attract these losers in the first place. Are you an
           emotional masochist, are you too nice and trusting a person?
           These guys will walk a mile to attach themselves to people like
           you. This may be the time to be a little more cynical, as bad
           as it may sound. Friends may be able to add some insight into
           why a nice guy like you attracts these jerks.
         * If Mr. loser disappears into a black hole somewhere, don't be 
           afraid to look up an old ex of his or chat with his friends.
           This isn't prying so much as it is therapy. They may share in-
           formation with you that will help you get over the ex in a much
           shorter time. It's ok to reality test.
         * Lastly, I hope you learn from your mistakes as I have. I'm much
           better off because of Danny. The relationship with him taught me
           many valuable lessons about what I do/don't want out of life.
         * When you do meet who you may think is Mr. Wonderful, don't rush
           into the vine covered cottage after 2 weeks. Take time to get to 
           him as a friend, date, court; it can be lots of fun and when the
           two of you decide to bed down together, much more satisfying.
           Even if the two of you never sleep together, you may have gained
           a valuable new friend. Remember you may not have a lover but you
           can never have too many good friends

From METROLINE, a hartford conn paper, Dec 28, 1984:  (Quoted w/o permission)
			TWO MORE HETEROSEXUAL *AIDS* CASES REPORTED
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Researchers reported two new heterosexual cases of 
	Aquired [sic] Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and warned the mysterious and
	often fatal disease could become an endemic to people of all sexual
	persuasions [sic, I say ``orientations''].
	 Drs. Paul Volberding and Constance Wofsy called a press conference to 
	report their findings and to urge ""safe sex"" practices for all San 
	Francisco Bay area residents.
	 Volberding recommended that hetersexuals confine sexual activity to 
	one partner, avoid promiscuity and use condoms consistently and 
	carefully with new partners.
	 ""It would be irresponsible not to give early notice to the 
	heterosexual community that sexual contact with persons carrying the 
	AIDS virus appears to put them at a risk for contracting the disease,"" 
	Volberding said.
	 The two latest heterosexual AIDS victims [sic, never say ``victim'' to 
	one who has AIDS] brings the total to four of cases outside the 
	so-called high risk category of homosexual men in San Francisco in less
	than one month. 
	 One case involved a woman who apparently contracted the disease three 
	and half years ago after an affair with a bisexual man.  Three 
	heterosexual men with AIDS have a history of sexual contacts with 
	prostitutes, Volberding said.
	 Volberding, director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic, 
	said the new cases ""further confirm our concern that AIDS is a disease 
	that hetersexuals can develop.  The major factor appears to be direct 
	sexual contact with persons who have the AIDS virus.
I offer this article only as a note.  The article isn't the best on the block, 
but it _was_ targeted for the motss-lovin' audience who are presumed to know

this will not help.  No comment on the prostitutes of the article.

	Second of a set of occasional articles on AIDS
	AIDS is an acronym for Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some notes
on that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causes
it, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.
	AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearance
of certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.
	[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occurs
in Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show other
opportunistic infections.]	
	By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has already
occurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 have 
already died.)
	Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedly
causes AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.
It involves antibodies to the virus.
	Some sample data on the test:
		Group				% HTLV-3 positive
		AIDS patients				99.7%
		pre-AIDS			       ~90%
		Healthy Homosexuals (in SF)	       ~70-80%
		IV Drug Users			[I don't have this one ~50%?]
		Hemophiliacs required F-VIII		~30%
		Random Healthy Heterosexuals		0.003%
	The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL but
rather POLITICAL reasons.
	The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive sign
means. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positive
later came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)
Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.
	The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect the
integrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registry
of those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use that
blood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by a
consent form which is confidential.]
	Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.
The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost as
good for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of the
country may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written on
this alone, but I must go on.
	The third reason is that people feared that people who may have been
exposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as a 
diagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much more
contamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if the
test is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enough
and misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.
	The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.

There are two forms of KS associated with AIDS: the ""traditional""
nonlethal skin cancer (call it KS1), & a novel (?) internal kind
found in lymph glands which also invades other organs (call it KS2).
I believe every KS1 AIDS patient tested for KS2 has had it, AND that
non-KS1 AIDS patients tested for KS2 have ALL had it.
Have searches for KS2 in nongay AIDS patients been made?

There is at least one MEDICAL reason for not using the test: it's not ""very""
reliable.  A group testing positive for HTLV-III on the bloodtest tested
NEGATIVE when a much more accurate & expensive test for HTLV-III was given.
The bloodtest can give FALSE POSITIVES.  See recent issues of the NYNative
for details.
""Political"" as used here is basically a putdown.  It suggests less than
fully valid, serious, or relevant reasons.
There are many GOOD reasons (label them what you will: legal, monetary,
social, medical) for not using/taking the bloodtest, which can be subsumed
under the heading DISCRIMINATION & ABUSE.  Namely, serious & probable risk
of:
	loss of medical insurance:  Blue Cross/Blue Shield & other medical
		insurance plans were REFUSING to cover homosexuals a while
		back; I don't know if they still are 
	loss of job, career, & income
	loss of housing
	assorted discrimination by people around you who know if you've
		tested positive
	discrimination & abuse by doctors, nurses, other medical staff &
		institutions
All of the above have happened more than a few times to AIDS patients.
The 200,000-300,000 gay men who VOLUNTEERED for the bloodtest were told
after the fact by the highest medical official in the land that he &
others COULD NOT guarantee confidentiality of results, even though it
had been promised to them (subsequently, he & other top officials
& physicians have urged people NOT to take the bloodtest because they
could not guarantee that the results wouldn't find their way to insu-
rance companies & employers).  There have been reports of the above
happening in a few cases to people simply because they were gay, knew
AIDS patients, had ARC (AIDS Related Complex: vague symptoms that may
be a precursor of AIDS 10% or less of the time), or merely had been
tested.  Given public hysteria over AIDS (including within the medical
profession), homophobia in groups like the Southern Medical Association,
and maltreatment & panic among some health care & public employees,
use of the bloodtest has more than merely ""partisan"" obstacles.
These reasons are far more important than any ""psychic risk"" of inflict-
ing ""AIDS anxiety"" on poor gays who test positive:  many gay men have
lived with far more severe anxieties for years now without ""succumbing""
psychologically.  Merely to exist as a gay person in this society is to
be a ""survivor"".

Articles HAVE been written on this, for a number of years now.  Read the
gay press or Village Voice, & especially the New York Native, which has
the most extensive coverage.
Ignoring false positives, the test is very good for beginning the process
of testing for AIDS.  But given statistics to date, only a tiny fraction
of those testing positive can be expected to eventually develop full-blown
AIDS.  The test DOESN'T identify those with AIDS.
The main objection to the test is NOT that it will force people out of
the closet, but that ALL gays testing postive, whether ""in"" or ""out"",
will be TREATED as AIDS carriers.  (Of course, in some situations, being
suddenly & involuntarily ""out"" can create problems.)
I must admit I found Craig's first article very interesting, & thought-
provoking.  But he ought to be more accurate & up-to-date.  I'm a mere
layperson who simply reads the gay press regularly, yet I get the impres-
sion I'm better informed.  That's a little scary.

gay press to be ""ahead"" of the articles in the scientific
literature - probably because of the lengthy critical
review process applied to scientific publications.
Two points:
    1.  We don't know how many patients exposed to HTLV will
        get the full-blown aids syndrome - it may take a few
        years to find out.
    2.  Blood banks are going to start screening blood for
        HTLV very soon.  What will they do with the information?
        What are there responsibilities to the donor and the
        public?

From today's (28 December 1984) Chicago Tribune:
NEW YORK -- Scientists say they have found at least part of the
reason the AIDS virus targets a key immune system cell, and an expert 
on the disease says the discovery may help interfere with the infection
process.  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune 
system by killing a certain kind of white blood cell, and the research
demonstrates that the suspected virus latches on to a particular protein
on the surface of that cell to begin infection.  Dr. Robert Gallo, an
AIDS expert at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD, said 
identifying the ""receptor"" protein for the virus was significant.
""If you know a lot about the receptor, it opens up ideas you didn't
have before,"" he said Thursday.  ""You can start doing things that might
interfere with the virus infection of the cell.""

	The actual protein involved is called CD4, and it occurs on so-called
T4 cells.
	Now for some immunology:
	Blood Cells are divided into Red and White Cells.
	White Cells are divided into B-Cells which make antibodies and
T-cells, which are for cellular immunity (and also are the things that
cause graft rejection.)
	T-cells are divided into several classes (1 - 8 so far) of which
T4 are one of the most important kind.
	T4 cells are helper cells - they make the rest of the immune system
work better.
	Note: in the absence of T4 cells, the AIDS virus, which is HTLV-3
(also called LAV) cannot grow. Immunosuppressed people shouldn't be able to
get AIDS. Experimentally, immunosuppressed cats don't get FAIDS (Feline AIDS)
One of the reasons, therefore that Gays, Drug Users, etc., are more suseptible
to AIDS (Besides the fact that they are exposed to the virus more often) is
that they tend to get other infections more often which activate the immune
system and make more T4 cells for the AIDS virus to grow on. (Talk about
Molecular Catch-22s)
	I'm a MD/PhD candidate in Immunology and recently heard Robert Gallo
give a very well-organized seminar, so I'll followup with another posting
on the history of AIDS.

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

  Forty percent of the single men in San Francisco are homosexual, and most of
them are well-educated and earning more than $20,000 a year, according to a
professional survey.
  The survey by the Research and Decisions Corporation, commissioned by the
city-financed SF AIDS Foundation, was designed to produce the first reliable
statistics on the city's homosexuals.
[This section heavily condensed]
Of 706,900 SF'ers, 69,960 are homosexual (based on 500 half-hour interviews).
32% of homosexual men in SF earn more than $30K, with 31% earning $20-$30K.
57% graduated from college, incl. 21% who continued in post-grad education.
42% of homosexual men in SF report they are in monogamous relationships and
13% have one primary relationship that includes outside sexual activity.
78% have all-male sexual partners, 14% are bisexual with mostly male partners
and 7% are bisexual with mostly female partners.
More than half of the homosexual men are in professional-managerial positions
or operate their own businesses.  Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.
About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,
with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.
A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliability
of the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed off
to them because they're gay.""  However, he also noted that many affluent
homosexuals were moving into San Francisco.

It is important to note a few important things about that survey:
1) that the survey was NOT a random sample,
2) the 500 were TELEPHONE interviews and more than 10% of the 
   salaries reported have already been declared as inflated
   and the investigation has just begun...think about it -
   if you weren't making much money and someone asked you
   how much you were making, in a telephone interview, wouldn't
   you be inclined to inflate it a little bit???
Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms,
and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia
from growing up in a world determined to assume that
everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are
all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia -
like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the
view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia
could be used against us...
just a thought from a lesbian here in sf...

    Many different kinds of postings happen on our slightly improbable net.
Occaisional light banter in Danish is fun, if only for the absurdity of doing
such a thing. There is no real information anyway, so no harm is done.
    On t'other hand, any time I intend to convey information, I will
do it in a language my recipients understand. To do otherwise would be
self-defeating.
    This process is actually self-enforcing. Anybody who wants to be
listened to will discover sooner or later that it helps if your recipient
can understand what you say. If somebody is not interested in helping
you understand him/her even that much, you probably have little to lose
by ignoring her/him.
re: article that raised the issue:
    The first Spiegel article was interesting enough [to me] to read,
but not to translate. (sorry! The gist was that AIDS is alive and
well in the German Fed. Republic, affecting both men and women. I
don't remember whether they also broke it down by sexual preference.)
I skipped the second article because I get eyestrain from variable spacing
between words. (Was that for anybody who made it past the language barrier:-?)

Fed up sex expert charges...
GAYS ARE WORSE THAN MURDERERS
    Homosexuals are prancing around the U.S. spreading the most monstrous
plague the world has ever known, says an outraged sexuality expert.
And, he says, ""They're worse than murderers.""
    ""Gay meeting areas, gay bars, gay baths should be closed immediately
and it should be illegal to be a homosexual,"" said Dr. Paul Cameron.
    And homosexuals should be required by the government to register
so that their movements could be tracked to halt the growing threat
of AIDS ( the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ), gonorrhea,
syphilis and hepatitis, he said.
    Cameron, who has a Ph.D. degree in sociology from the
University of Colorado, is chairman of the Institute for
Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, Nebr. [ I wonder
if they investigate sexuality anywhere else? :-) ]
    ""Most murderers commit a crime and are punished, but gays are
promiscuous and do bad deeds constantly, and as such, are worse
than murderers.
    ""Whenever gays take over an organization, they trash it,"" he
said.  ""I haven't met one yet who wasn't a fairly vicious person.""
    Statistics put together by Cameron's institute reveal a
shocking 5 percent of America's 210 million population is
either bisexual or homosexual.
    Latest figures show an incredible rise in the number of
dreaded AIDS cases so far this year - 2,886 comapred to 1,390
this time last year, according to Cameron.
    ""AIDS is a horrible plague on society,"" said Cameron.
    ""A shocking 40 to 60 percent of all gays show evidence of
infection from the AIDS virus.
    ""This terrible desease is costing American taxpayers $7
million a week for treatment.""
    Cameron recently testified before the Maine Human Rights
Commission regarding a gay rights bill to stop job
discrimination against homosexuals in that state.
    ""Such a bill would give gays preferred status in jobs and
that would allow them to get a better crack at our kids, handle
our food and blood,"" he said.  ""It would legitimize people who
are doing something socially worthless.  And it ( the bill ) would
be of tremendous disservice to the homosexuals who might otherwise
be pressured by society to go straight.""
    Fortunately, Cameron told the NEWS, his only son is a normal,
healthy young man.
    ""We practice the Christian faith in our family and if my son were
gay, it would be one of the most horrible things that could happen,""
he said.  ""If it had happened, my son would be disowned.""

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

(Byron's reply)
Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny.  AIDS is serum-vectored
not 'homosexual vectored.' 
 
               ***(Ken now) 
             Wrong!!!  A vector is, ""an insect or other ORGANISM (italics
mine) transmitting germs or other agents of disease"" - Am Coll. Dict. 
The serum is merely the medium the virus is in, NOT the vector.  Or to put it
another way, the action (behavior) of the vector passes the virus, the serum is
neutral.  It is the behavior of the vector, in this case homosexuals which 
passes on the disease.  Such as anal intercourse, which often causes minute
tearing of the small blood vessels in the lower bowel and makes possible the
passing of the virus.  Also the passing of other serums (saliva, semen) 
transmits the virus.
************************
NOW HEAR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
************************
 
       I am NOT, that is NOT, saying that homosexuals are responsible for AIDS!
The virus is, of course!!  They are responsible (the promiscuous ones, remember
the same way promiscuous hetrosexuals are responsible for other sexually 
related diseases) for the TRANSMISSION of the disease virus!!!!!
If you, or anyone else, cares to remember I started this whole thing by saying
""smugly of course"" AIDS would be a hammar blow to drive the homosexuals back
into the closet and what are the gays doing about that.  The answer so soon
forthcoming, from Steve Dyer, et al, was ""EEk, get away from me, you rough
trade you.  How dare you even ASK such a question, etc., etc.""  They treated
me like a fart at a cheeze tasters ball.  I know, I know, I didn't say ""may
I"" and tell how much I think you all contribute to civilization and what
great guys and gals you all are otherwise.
 
I would have thought a reasonable response would have been, ""yes we have a
problem and here is what we are doing about it . . . ie. speaking out against
bath house sex as unhealthy if not psychologically, then from a physical
standpoint.  Remember gang, it's not just AIDS out there haunting the gay
community!  There are a raft of nasties of which the gay community is the
vector.
 
   (Byron answers previous posting)                                            
The first identifiable breakout just happens
to have been in the gay population.  It could have as easily been among
drug addicts, pro football players or army privates.  The first instances
of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century.  That
doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it.  Was the American
Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?
        *****(Ken replies now)
           Well, it actually started in Africa and the Carib. but yes in the
U.S.of A. it ""came out"" in the gay community.  Again, I agree with you that
the gays are not responsible for the virus!!!  But they ARE, that's ARE, 
responsible for continuing to be the vector once it became known HOW the
virus was passed!!  To take measures (filter blood supply, avoid contact, etc)
against the vector is a reasonable thing to do.  And homosexuals themselves
are taking steps to guard against getting the disease.
**************
Note:  No one is taking steps against the serum!!  Wiping out spit, semen, 
blood.  Isn't that because the serum is not the vector????  What IS being
done, or at least ought to be done, is to take steps against the vector.
Bath houses ARE being closed.  Often on the request of homosexual groups!

>What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious

It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place
blame.  That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it
certainly doesn't protect either of us.  Do you have anything constructive
to offer?  If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments.
       ****(new Ken now)
              You muddle-headed shit-head!  Promiscuous homosexuals ARE to
""blame"" for passing on the virus!!!  And now the more so since they KNOW
they are the vector.  But that is NOT the point of my postings.  You, and
your clones, -: appear to me to be like a little child caught at something
or other.  Trying to point to anything else but themselves. The point of all
my postings was, and is, to get responses from the gay community as to how
they plan to deal with the very real dangers that confront them.  Lucky for
you all gays are not like the few on this net who can't seem to deal with
me.  There isn't anyone who says that the homosexual community isn't the
vector for these diseases!!!!!  That's no news.  That's not the point of
any of my postings.
I see a tidal wave of events shaping up before the gay community that will
wipe them out!!!!  You mumble and press the ""n"" key.  Great!  Maybe the
Smithsonian will be able to preserve a few of you in pickle jars.
[By the way, I have been toying with a piece on the impact of ""modern"" ethics
as seen in statements by bioethicists on abortion, on the homosexual community.
That is, if gays are ever seen as a ""diseased"" danger, a quality of life issue,  
or a threat to the majority's value system if that value system doesn't include
any idea of the value of the individual. Do the new ""ethics"" set the stage
for sending the gays to the ""showers""?]

>You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise

 (old Byron)
So what are YOU going to do about it?  If AIDS is in the general population
then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility.  What
are you trying to do?  From the tone and content of your postings all I
can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back!  The smugness
that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune.
I got news for you.  Viruses mutate.  It's what they do.  That's how
the disease got here in the first place according to some.  Should
this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble
and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us 
out of that trouble.
      ************(Ken now)
       I told YOU they mutate.  And yes some feel that's where this outbreak
came from.  It's only a half-brainer to figure out what we'll do if it gets
into the general public.  PANIC!!!!  And look for SCAPEGOATS!!  And isolate
them!!!  Guess who?  
It is partly because of my concern for myself that I have raised the issue
with you.  I am potentially at risk.  Because of YOU (or your promiscuous 
fellows).  
What am I doing???  Well, for starters I've given you all more information
than you've ever seen on this net. I've gone to the vector and asked for
a plan of action.  Some of you ARE in homosexual organizations.  It doesn't
appear that you know of any action to stop the disease.  Just treat it.
I'm asking you to take it back??  Cute but stupid.  Not to mention a lie.
Smug?!  Is that your best answer??  Sad.
 
What am I doing??? See below in the very next section.  Aren't I asking you
to take some action.  Tell me, to the best of your memory, has anyone on the
net said perhaps the gays should relook at their ""lifestyles"" even if only 
during the present health crisis?  Maybe one or two touched on it, but most
(like you) just stood on a chair and pulled up their skirts.

Isn't this all a little like locking the barn door after the horses have

a tragedy, now WHAT ARE YOU AND I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
             ******(new Ken)
        Looking at it as locking the barn door is just plain stupid - and
dangerous for the gays.  Changing promiscuous behavior NOW could provent
a lot of cases of AIDS.
 
Yes, by all means, let's get together and come up with ""what you and I are
going to do about it.""

Glad you said that my statement to the effect that Aids is ""homosexually
vectored"" is SOMEWHAT imprecise!  Because it's not imprecise by much if
at all.  ""Intermingling of blood"", yes but not from bumping into each other,
unless . . . (but I'm trying to change).  It's not the fact of transfusions
(the act) that causes Aids!  I get Aids from a carrier who donated blood.
The carriers are identified as . . . (fill in the blanks).  You seem to be
saying pouring blood causes Aids!  ""Aids is transmitted through the inter-
mingling of blood supply as might happen with transfusion.""
By the way, Aids is also transmitted through semen and some feel through
saliva.
What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious

was that very fact!!!
Where do you read my ""smug assurance"" of my own safety??
I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to
your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.
Why would my ""smugness"" frighten you??
You do have a reason to be frightened.  Tonight on the NBC nightly noise
there was an extended (180 sec.- so it was a heavy topic) piece on children
with Aids.  About 70 so far, with hundreds more projected.  They highlighted
the problems of one little boy under sentence of death (are you SURE that
homosexuals are not responsible just a little - even those not promiscuous
but who fail to speak out against fellow gays who are?) who was rejected 
out of fear by the school system where the doctors said he was safe to go.
Administrators and parents freaked out.  NO way.  ""I'll take my child out.""
Hey, it's getting bigger by the minute.  You've got to do more than raise
funds, teach each other to check for sores first and man hotlines.  Hint:
You've got to speak to fellow gays about behavior patterns (which might
entail relooking at ""lifestyles"" ((baths, bars, etc.))).
How about looking at the ""sexual revolution""?  Remember the young Aids

approve of Mr. Ardnt.
From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct 10, 1984.
In a prepared statement on Tuesday, San Francisco public health director
Mervyn Silveman said ""These businesses (gay bathhouses) have been
inspected on a number of occasions and demonstrate a blatant disregard for
the health of their patrons and of the community.
	""Make no mistake about it. These 14 establishments are not
fostering gay liberation. They are fostering disease and death.""
	He then ordered the commercial sex establishments closed.
Silverman had threatened to close the bathhouses and other commercial
sex establishments last March, but instead ordered a ban on sex in such
establishments in the city. Silverman said his decision (to close the
bathhouses) was reached because ""we now have solid evidence that AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease - often spread by people who are unaware that
they are carrying the virus. The virus, he said, has been found in 40 to 50
percent of the gay male population in San Francisco.

  I thought this might be of use to you after your last posting.
  It is extracted from:
              A Primer on How to Work With the USENET Community
                        Chuq Von Rospach (nsc!chuqui)
 
     and should remind you that we all are human, and have to live on
     this planet together, for better or for worse:
(also, see NYTimes, Oct 2, front page science section)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Never Forget that the Person on the Other Side is Human
  Because your interaction with the network is through a computer it is easy
  to forget that there are people ""out there."" Situations arise where
  emotions erupt into a verbal free-for-all that can lead to hurt feelings.
  Please remember that people all over the world are reading your words.  Do
  not attack people if you cannot persuade them with your presentation of
  the facts.  Screaming, cursing, and abusing others only serves to make
  people think less of you and be less willing to help you when you need it.
  If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have had a chance
  to calm down and think about it.  A cup of coffee or a good night's sleep
  works wonders on your perspective.  Hasty words create more problems than
  they solve.  Try not to say anything to others you would not say to them
  in person in a room full of people.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now, lets see what juicy lines we find from Ken:
      Ken->         And never to know that one woman
                    who above all others fills your life as a woman, to 
                    stand beside her as she gives birth to your child -
                    Doesn't hurt you?  YOU LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE!!
Ken, sometimes I wonder why I reply.  I should just stand back and let
you dig your own grave.  Does it surprise you to know that I take
personal offense at your comments?  Would you like to be called a
LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE?  That's pretty rude, Ken.  If I was female, I
sure hope that I wouldn't have to 'fill your life.'  It must be a pretty
tedious job.
 
          Ken->     Some laws against homosexuals ARE being enforced (in the
                    armed forces, - try waving it around in the park as a sign
                    of ""affection"" in the heartland or here in New Hampster
                    and see if the laws are being enforced).
I don't really want to imagine what 'waving it around in the park'
means.  Whatever it is, I don't do it.  And am I my brother
(homosexual's) keeper?  Well, they can do what they want, but PLEASE
don't assume that all gay people are the same, Ken.  It's really the
minority that have bathroom sex, visit the baths, get AIDS.  Did you
know that according to the Center for Disease Control, the average AIDS
patient (gay male with AIDS) had more than 60 sexual partners a year?
And the percentage of those partners that were found in bathhouses were
about 85%.  I'm NOT trying to justify this, I think it's AWFUL, but
please don't paint us all with the same brush.  That's like saying that
all black people are stupid and walk around carrying ghetto blasters. It
MAY be TRUE in a few cases, but BY and LARGE it's a gross
generalization.
Ken-->              And of course we know that things are not going to revert
                    to the bad old days in the closet, right?  Wrong bozo.
                    See below.
 
Bozo?  Read the paragraphs on top again, once or twice.                                                                                  
Ken-->             I'm reminded of the first Russian soldiers into Berlin.
                   They were very well behaved towards the civilians.  Just
                   interested in killing German soldiers.  But one of them
                   is quoted as saying, ""Look out for those who come behind
                   us.  They are pigs.""  He was right.  And my point here is
                   that you might be a lot better off than you think if I DID
                   set the values.  I'm not for putting you all in jail - yet!
(THANK YOU, ken. You're SO kind. *sarcasm*)
                       A sea story-> (oh goody) To illustrate my limits.
                       I remember being in a long line in boot camp, short
                       arm inspection or something, and there was this guy
                       on the floor in the hall who couldn't take the whole
                       boot camp bit and was crying.  I felt so bad I wanted
                       to step out of line and comfort him.  Some of the other
                       guys were kicking him as they went by.  By the time I
                       came abreast of him I had decided to kick him too.  So
                       I did!  It's great to be part of a tradition!!
(It's great to be an a--hole)
(Sorry.  I guess I should read the top, also)
                       Now the point of that little sea story, in case you
                       missed it, is that there are values and there are
                       values.
Tell me Ken, when you see someone suffering, do you enjoy making them
suffer more?  And PLEASE STOP this 'military defense' of your points.  I
KNOW (from extrapolation on personal experience) that there are
THOUSANDS of gays in the military around the country.  And they serve
their country well.  Stop thinking that people are EXCLUSIVLY gay.  That
is not the case.  Being gay is NOT the #1 thing in the lives of many
homosexuals.  (I'll admit, though, it is the #1 thing for SOME people)
                As for your statement that homosexual behavior is becoming more
                accepted, why there is evidence that that is just not so, even
                with the new T.V. shows. We are just now entering into the time
(Sorry.  I don't watch tv, nor have the time or desire to do so.)
                when the baby boomers are coming of age and THEY are the ones
                who will be setting the values over the next quarter century!
                Guess what?  They are more conservative than their parents!
                Read the poles.  They are by a huge majority for Reagan and
(I have never tried to read a polish person.  They might get mad)
                his values.  You do know where he stands on the moral issue
                don't you?  
One of the BEST things about Raygun :-) is that he HASN'T done to much
about moral issues.  And with a son like his...... (two :-)

                   prone.  But I feel I've answered this in my replies to
                   Richard Johnson and Steve Dyer.
 
  Are they my problem, Ken?  I'm not so sure.  Are  the  whites  in  the
ghetto  your problem?  Are the men who rape little girls 'your' problem?
Also, read the paragraph atop this posting AGAIN!  What do you mean by
'chicken neck'? You're getting REALLY rude. I'm sure you'll be
leading  that mob, Ken, but I intend to meet you (and whatever mob you've
gathered) with a machine gun and plenty of bullets.
 
 Ken-->          I just know you'll wake up tomorrow morning and say I was
                 right and go out and grab a woman.  (If you get stuck on
                 what to do after you grab call me.)   
Ken, that's really funny.  Havn't you ever had anyone tell you how the
gay guys get all the girls?  Do you think I havn't at least TRIED it
with one (or two...) girls.  Maybe YOU should call ME when YOU need
help.
 
Ken--->	               Shiiiiiit!
I won't say it again.
Ken-->           Love ya,
                  Ken Arndt    				
Y'know Ken... I love ya too.  You're really an interesting person.

Ken has to say.  (Yes, I'm serious!).
His anecdote about kicking the guy in boot camp was an interesting
point that no matter how wonderful and loving we think we are
we like to follow the crowd ('we' is us people generally).  (Ironically
enough, that appears to be the attitude taken towards Ken by some
readers of this newsgroup).
One of Ken's points is that many homosexuals may be kidding themselves
that things are just getting better and will continue to do so.
I agree that things are better for Gay people -- in urban centers
and tolerant communities; but what about in The Sticks, in
Podunk, etc?
Further, Ken points out that this air of liberal tolerance can disappear
at any time -- Mr. Falwell reaches far more people than any Gay spokespeople.
Ken is right on this point, too, and I think that is something to
worry about.  Not that Mr. Falwell does not have his right to speak
but that there isn't really ""equal time"" (and no I don't suggest
legal enforcement of equal time, either).
Ken is an abbrasive annoying person, but he makes many points I think
should be heeded.  I am beginning to believe that he IS trying help Gay
people, in his own irritating insulting way.  It's just that by paying
attention to the form and not the content, you're missing it.
A while ago, in my last defense of Ken Arndt, someone said something
like ""oh, he quotes some shit from Masters and Johnson and you're
impressed.""  It just so happens that I have read the same ""shit""
myself, and I was trying to point out that the information wasn't
biased but everyone else thought it was because if Ken Arndt said it
it can't be true.  I don't see how people can delude themselves like
this...
Also quoting the Net Etiquette to Ken won't help.  He's clearly
beyond that now.  Not that his behavior is something you want
to encourage, of course, but Ken doesn't strike me as someone
who'd fall on his knees begging forgiveness for transgressing
against Rules of Etiquette.
Finally, I am not entirely thrilled of speaking in support of Ken Arndt,
but I've always enjoyed taking the (in this case) minority viewpoint,
especially when it offers something of value.
I do have some rebuttals for Ken to be posted later, but I didn't
want to join the ""Let's beat up Ken"" crowd.
Again, don't mistake the form for the content.

on our national health system.
Dr. John Dwyer of Yale-New Haven Hospital calls it ""the disease of the
century in every respect"" - including financial.
Roger McFarland, head of the Gay Men's Health Crisis committee in NYC,
says, ""AIDS is a human tragedy and a financial nightmare that no one is
facing up to.""
George Seage, epidemiologist for the city of Boston says, ""We have an
epidemic not only of AIDS cases but of AIDS costs.  We're talking about
an incredible cost epidemic that's going to put a strain on the medical
system.""
[Of course this is just data that fits my view, right??  We all know, as
some on the net have pointed out, that data is only a propaganda tool
especially when it doesn't ""fit"".]
The above quotes are from today's Boston Globe.
The article also points out the call for regional centers to deal with
AIDS patients as our hospitals are being swamped.  AIDS victims require
much extra care (separate food handling, laundry, etc.) and the costs are
such (100K + per) that it is a strain on current funding (Soc. Sec., Medicaid,
CDC research funding, etc.).  One Billion $ this year and two Billion projected
for 1985!  Care costs that is.
Congress and Margret Heckler are baulking at providing more funding!!  Not
because they hate homosexuals, but because there is just not enough money
to go around.  As I pointed out before, research $ are being taken now from
other projects at CDC (such as the current epidemic of rabies moving up the
East Coast) to fund AIDS research.  But research funding is only a small part
of the money needed for the AIDS epidemic!  Hospital support costs are the
major ones as stated above.
Some sad, sad facts.  Boston is now in the early stages of it's AIDS epidemic!
(Do you know who your SO has been with during the last four years??)
Typically there has been 18 months between diagnosis and death in AIDS cases.
What kinds of public pressure are going to surface when the cost to society of
this homosexually vectored disease become more apparent?
 
Anyone on the net care to make a guess?  Opps!  I forgot.  No one will
answer because of my past postings!
Again, health and child abuse issues ARE impacting the perspective the public
has of the homosexual community and it's drive for ""rights"".  Too bad I have
made it impossible to speak to these issues on motss.  On top of that I have
driven netters away and silenced any other topics.  The power of the Lymph

that idiot who called Judiasm a ""gutter religion"", and any other persons

            hard to quantify.  I don't think your point about blacks and

            by and large have won their battle for acceptance, their moral
            case anyway.  I think that very few, on hearing of the Zebra
            killings would say ""isn't that just like blacks?"".  Indeed,  
            that was your point, wasn't it.  The question is, have the
            homosexuals gained acceptence as a rightful minority?  Even
            they say no.  Therefore, it seems to me that many if not most
            people, upon hearing of NAMBLA or the Rene Guyon Society WOULD
            link them with all homosexuals.  Witness the concern over
            allowing homosexual teachers!!  Now homosexuals say that they
            should not be viewed this way - you have heard their statements
            on this net vis a vis teaching.  Homosexuals may be right in
            their statements but I don't think that they have gotten the
            agreement of the majority of parents out there, do you?  Ergo,
            if access to the workplace, etc. is an issue the homosexual
            community still has some work to do.  See my recent posting
            (ignore the swamp gas he engenders from me) to Steve Dyer on
            this point.
            I never said that the ""Silent Shame"" T.V. show was strictly
            about homosexuals!!!  Only that it highlighted an interview
            with the Rene Guyon Society.  I referenced the show as another
            source of information about them.  I don't know where you got
            the idea that I believe child abuse is strickly or even mostly
            a homosexual issue!  
 
            I just reread my posting on ""chickenhawks"" and I would like you
            to do the same.  My exact wording was: ""Did anyone see the T.V.
            show 'Silent Shame'?  They MENTIONED (italics mine!!)
            chickenhawks.""  I really don't see how you leap from that 
            statement to my saying it was a homosexual theme show and I
            believe, etc.
Well, thanks for your comments.  Any comments on my comments??

Ken,
    Wherever did you get the idea that blacks have won their battle ? Just
because the legislation exists doesn't make them 100% free yet. I'm sure I
don't need to give you examples. But then, neither are *any* groups (I won't
use minorities here - the WASPs will soon be the minority) 100% free from the
primitive prejudices of Our Wonderful Country. You and I both know there is 
a white, predominantly male ruling class. Period. To what degree acceptance
is made shouldn't be an issue. Thirty years ago, blacks were in just about
as high favor as gays. If not worse, due to their visibility in the society.
Sure, they've paid their dues. We gave them no choice. Ditto homosexuals. 
Where is the logic in disputing another's right to LIVING AS THEY PLEASE, 
when your forebearers fought for the same thing ? If not you yourself ?
I could be wrong, but sometimes I think you still are stinging from your own
search for *whatever*, and want to make sure others have a tough time. 
Fuck this issue of genetics/hormones/choice/too much peanut butter before
age 13. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JUST LIVING YOUR LIFE AS YOU PLEASE ? I don't
advocate messing with other people's lives, either. But then, I have told
a Baptist preacher to go fuck himself to his face for bothering me with his
paranoid convictions. 
     An analogy I read recently: Why can't homosexuality be like buying 
shoes ? Just because you don't like the shoes doesn't mean you run into
the shoe store and bludgeon the owner. I hear you on the AIDS issue and
promiscuity. I hear you on unsafe sexual practices in general, exclusive
of preferences. I hear you on pedophiles. But your arguement about 'we
still have to pay dues' (not any sort of quote) is falling on deaf ears.
I know that. What would you like to do to help ?

                  don't try to deny the statements are true.  
Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rights
very early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for total
self-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this was
not limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referred
to) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them.  I
don't think there's much more to be said here.

                  of my posting.  So glad to hear that most if not all of the
                  netters thought it was ""bonkers"".  Now who else knows you
                  think that?  I mean who else in the ""straight"" world, because
                  THAT'S where it counts!!!  IN THE MINDS OF THE STRAIGHT WORLD
                  YOU ARE, THAT'S ARE, CONNECTED WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!  The
                  Rene Guyon Society certainly see themselves as part of the
                  sexual rights freedom movement.  It's starting to sound like
                  a religious ""sectual"" fight!
 
All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly try
to dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA.  The key to
remember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and the
only groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and the
{_members of such groups themselves.  Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerpts
from pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of both
female and male children: where are the gay issues here?  Why did Arndt not
take this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,
where he could take the straight community to task for their own shameful
members?  Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.
One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.
Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to
""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,
""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""
              > Document that statement!  What groups have dissociated and
                where do they say so!  If ""child/adult"" sex rights are not a
                gay rights issue then why do I see children holding signs
                proclaiming their rights to sex with whomever they ""choose""
                in homosexual rights marches???  For instance in the recent
                march in San Francisco during the Democratic convention.
                Groups like NAMBLA and Guyon are filled with homosexuals!
                What the hell does North American MAN/BOY Association mean??
                And as you may read if you care to the Guyon people are not
                particular as to the sex of the child they destroy.
 
                Yes, the quotes I presented listed hetero and homo relations,
                but how does the mention of both mean no gay issues in your
                mind?  I know tumesence clouds conscience, but in your case
                it seems to cloud thinking as well.  
                Really!  Why don't I speak to others who are doing the same
                thing!  Why pick on motss.  Because I am speaking to YOU!
                That isn't against the law yet!  You act as if to question
                your ""lifestyle"" in any of its aspects is (is jerk, in case
                you don't end sentences that way on motss).  In my previous
                postings I mentioned heterosexual behavior and I assure you
                I don't condone child abuse by heterosexuals.  I DO have an
                ""axe to grind"" with them on this issue. (Guess why I don't
                have an ""axe to grind"" with them otherwise, unless you consider
                the physical and psychological results of promiscuousity, -
                the issue we are looking at is homosexual behavior and they 
                are not homosexual.)  Anyway, you see this as picking on you.
 
                I'm sorry Steve but you really sound childish.  ""I'll take my
                balls home if you don't play my way!""  I must say that not to
                let us play with your balls is unfriendly on this net.  
 
 
Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gay
community (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gay
community.)  Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very small
minority supports the aims of such groups, with most people either
against or indifferent.
               > I'm not so sure about not being able to find a focus of
                 information about the gay community.  There is a national
                 network with a central message.  Perhaps if you don't
                 know about it I should document it all for you.
                 I would agree with your second sentence.  BUT MY WHOLE
                 POINT TO YOU IS THAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING THAT MESSAGE
                 ACROSS TO THE STRAIGHT WORLD!!!  Along with things like
                 the health crisis in the homosexual community and its
                 possible outbreak into the straight world, being seen
                 (as you are more and more with each march that includes
                 the children's crusade and each new interview with some
                 bow tied balding middle aged geek slavering over four
                 year olds ""with a little massage who WANT . . ."") you
                 homosexuals are setting yourselves up to take it in the
                 neck (a new sensation, unlike ""fisting"" you may not like).
                 What to do?  I'm not advocating full page adds or buttons
                 ""I'm not a chickenhawk"", but the thing that started me off
                 was Mike B's listing this topic at the end of a number of
                 topics about homosexual lifestyles (HE sees it, it seems,
                 as a homosexual issue) and I wondered in public if he really
                 knew what ""chickenhawks"" really are.  Don't tell me you don't
                 agree with Rene (he's a real person) and NAMBLA, I believe
                 you Steve.  (Now there's two of us) I'll sit right down and
                 write Jerry a letter to let him know too.  Hope he believes 
                 me next time he gets all hot about your marches and all.
                 Laugh all you want to about him, but he DOES speak for 
                 millions of people when he denounces you.  And not just 
                 Baptists!!!
 
One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS and
promiscuity haven't received a response.  Nope, they haven't, and it's no
wonder.  Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, but
unfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority of
net.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior.  It's actually pretty
hilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needs
to do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guise
of martyr.  Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, and
by my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlier
behavior.  We'll see.
                 > Big bad Arndt, keeping you all from an interesting
                   discussion.  There you go again, hiding your balls.
                   ""Ma he's hitting me again"" is getting a bit thin don't you
                   think?
 
                   You're actually keeping a score on my postings?  Merde!
                   I guess this one goes on the debit side.  Hilarity is the
                   wrong response Steve, they're trying to tell you something.
                   How many good postings do I have to make to break even?
                   Get ahead?  (By that I mean be MORE than even - I have to
                   be careful how I express myself on this net)  
                   Listen Steve, even you seem to be saying that you have seen
                   a change in my postings, perhaps not this one.  But let me
                   ask you, how many people that you have talked to or heard of
                   have changed even a little in respect to how they regard
                   you starting from my position?  How many people that you 
                   have met on this net have taken the time to research data
                   and attempt to change from bashing to dialog?  I deserve

I have always seen that used, not to describe child molesters, but
those who are attracted to slim, usually blond, boys just ""this side""
of legal age, and those lucky enough (UGGH) to keep that look as they
get older.  Of course, I don't know whether such people ""card"" their
acquaintances first, but we are now discussing the gray area of the
age of consent, where reasonable people may disagree.  I am not going
to waste my time defending someone's right to a 16 year old, but at
the same time, if a 16 year old has the right to marry and have kids,
it seems logical to presume that there isn't quite as much
""victimization"" present there as, say, with a younger child.  Mom and
Dad may disagree; I prefer not to take any stand at all.  Anyway, my
point is that I interpreted the phrase differently than you did.
By the way, just what IS this big national gay network you are
referring to?  And what's the ""central message?""  I'd like to know just
what is happening.  Sometimes I feel life is just passing me by in
this hick town...  Where do I suscribe?
Both the National Gay Task Force and the Gay Rights National Lobby
have repeatedly made public statements disassociating themselves with
the aims of pedophile organizations.  Naturally, we are lucky if any
of them gained more than the back pages of the daily newspapers, if at
all.  Which brings us to the crux of the issue.
You seem to see the limited ""P.R."" ability of the gay community as
due to lack of trying.  It is much more complicated than that.

You seem to see the limited ""P.R."" ability of the gay community as
due to lack of trying.  It is much more complicated than that.
Naturally one would like the ""message"" to get across to as many
people as possible, but the gay rights movement is very young
compared to the civil rights movement.  What we see here are the
earliest rumblings of a movement, one which is still not unified,
and which has only begun to make the attempt to change societal
attitudes, and here, mainly through small, local actions: changing the
attitudes of one's neighbors comes before the attitudes of the country
at large.  Net.motss is one vehicle towards this.  Having gay people
speak out and publically affirm their identity is one vehicle towards
this.  Seeing openly gay people elected to public office (e.g. Studds,
Boston city councillor David Scondras) is one vehicle toward this.
As helpful as laws and ordinances can be towards ensuring equal
rights, one cannot legislate attitudes.
Your comment about society recognizing racial equality as an inherent
""right"" is not qualitatively different from a respect for a person's
sexual and affectional preference.  What you are seeing, though, are
attitudes at opposite ends of the time line.  A comment like yours
about racial equality would have seemed equally outrageous, 100, 50,
even 20 years ago in some parts.  Changing attitudes takes time.
Already the situation of gay people today is far far better than
20 years ago, even with the Brunsons still in the outback.
We will have come a long way when the claims of a Falwell are
dismissed out of hand by people, simply because they know gay
people and recognize the caricature which such demagogues present
as an enormous lie.  Sure we aren't there yet.  It will be a
matter of time.  In most urban centers, there is significant
progress along these lines.  You might argue that such ""progress"" is
illusory, and there are many more people outside the cities with
more retrograde ideas.  Perhaps, but this is the nature of change;
it starts in the cities and only later is accepted in general.

Chickenhawks indeed!!!!
Is this discussion going to turn into another piece of homogenized crap
on the general topic of homosexual ""lifestyles"" without anyone other than
myself speaking up?  Despite Ken Perlow's assertion to the contrary, I very
clearly said I was speaking against PROMISCUOUS behavior and invited others
to examine that as a ""lifestyle"" issue in light of its physical (AIDS, etc.)
and psychological implications.  I believe I remember one, maybe two people
addressing the issue as minor points in their postings.
Did anyone see the recent T.V. ""Silent Shame"" show about child abuse?  They
mentioned ""chickenhawks"".  Had a member of the Rene Guyon Society (10,000
members in the U.S.) who came right out and SAID what they say in their
literature!  They have a RIGHT to our kids!!!!!!  WE are wrong for not letting
them have them!!!  They want LAWS!!!  Hey, the ""right"" SS will march if 
this gets anywhere.  
SO OTHER THAN A FEW WEAK, ""I DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS"", HOW DO THE MEMBERS OF
THE NET FEEL?   For, against, won't march with them, not your problem (if you
believe that you're crazy), might even speak out against them (Why?)???
But read from their literature:
ANAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT (italics
theirs), can easily hold after massage, and will be allowed to have a teen-
ager or older male's condom-covered penis in their anus.  Tiny children will
be required to wear a small ""finger stall"" or ""finger cot"" (obtainable from
a drug store) condom from age 4 or any earlier age that they start penetrating
male and female anuses.  99% of the day there is no fecal matter in the anus.
No enema is required.
ORAL COPULATION
At age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT, can easily
hold, and will be allowed to have a tiny child, teenager, or older male's penis
in their mouth.  This will bring an end to thumbsucking.  The child will at 
last get valuable hormones that appear in the mature male's ejaculate that have
been denied children in the past.  Very young, teenage and adult females will
be allowed to provide sexual satisfaction with their mouths and tongues to the
penis and clitoris of young children.
------------------------------
And it goes on, PENIS-VAGINA COPULATION, MASTURBATION, NUDITY ALONE WITH NO
SEXUAL ACTIONS, but I'm sick of typing what I'm typing.
 
The main purpose of the organization is to convince the public that all laws
controlling nonconsensual sex must be abolished.
The above are part of a promotional package handed out by the Society as a
summary of the revisions to the California Penal Code proposed by them.

Co., by Enrique T. Rueda, 1982, p.177ff.)
NOW PLEASE NOTE:  I am NOT trying to tar all homosexuals with the same brush.
I am asking the homosexual community just what they propose to do about these
people in their movement. (I know what I propose to do)  Something, nothing??
It would really freak me out to see you pass over this topic as if it were
like wearing women's undergarments.
Question:  Is this a topic that is just to early to push for acceptance by
the public?  I mean, after the law recognizes homosexual ""rights"" is this
the next barrier?  Is there any last barrier?  Or will someone really marry
a tree?

who commit unusual acts and happen to be black. And, the heterosexual

Oh boy, another California lunatic fringe group, and Arndt goes all to
pieces.  So Arndt, are you German, or of German heritage?  If so, what
are you going to do about Germany's neo-Nazis?  Or closer to home,
the American Nazi Party?  When you hear Meir Kahane speak, do you
assume that he speaks for all Jews?  Or Jerry Falwell for all Christians?
Sometimes the best strategy w/r/t loonies is to ignore them.

	I have been following the conversation somewhat episodically over 
the last few months, due to problems with local (computer!) 
authorities, but I could not help noticing the extent to which 
the responses to Mr. Arndt and his clones have managed to force 
their way into nearly every single letter written to this group. 
This has now progressed to the point where all of the letters currently
available at my institution in this newsgroup are either written by the 
Arndt Gang, or are replies to them. This situation is not new: 
many of you probably remember that
Arndt managed for some time to disrupt the debate also in net.women, from 
which he was eventually expelled, never to reappear again. It is unlikely,
though, that this will happen here too: differently from that case, now 
Mr. Arndt is persuaded to be waging a Holy War, and nothing we say will
make him desist from it. You all know how impermeable he is to every sort
of argumentation, how uninterested he is in listening, and how badly he has
damaged discussion in this group.
	There are two possible soultions to this problem: the first is what 
was proposed some time ago in net.women, i.e. the creation of a private 
mail group from which any non-constructive contribution could be easily 
excluded. This feminist mail group is now alive and prospering, has received
more than 300 contributions, and the environment is so pleasant that 
quite a number of people have told intimate personal stories. This is a 
possible way out. 
	Alternatively, one may reason as follows: women's movements have 
gained a degree of acceptance which gay-rights movements are very far from
achieving, so that the retreat into a private mailgroup, which would be
quite acceptable for women, is to be considered a political defeat in this
case. Holding the debate in a public forum like this is also a part 
of 'coming out', and we shouldn't allow Mr. Arndt and his clones to shut
evryone up, and lock the closet again.
	I see some pluses in this line of argument. But in this case, 
we should probably accept the obvious: no debate is possible with Mr. Arndt
and the hypocrites who disapprove of his ways and approve of his ideas 
(which ones?) and of his carefully researched data (straight out of 
Jerry Falwell's pocket). We should then propose and enforce a policy of
total neglect of Mr. Arndt, one by which none of his arguments is mentioned
in any contribution, none of his lurid jokes and insinuations are 
answered, none of his clones' support respected.
	This is very different from rejecting debate: it would only
mean restoring this forum to its original function (message # 1):
>Net.motss is designed to foster discussion on a wide variety of topics, such as
>health problems, parenting, relationships, clearances, job security and
>many others.  Gay members of USENET will find this a supportive environment

Dear Mr. DeBenedictis:
Re. your postling below I would like to take the opportunity to answer
it point by point.  First let me say thank you for the very fine tone
of your reply.  I would very much like to emulate you.  The people on
this net ARE very sensitive and defensive about anyone who questions 
their lifestyle and behavior but I have been offensive in tone in the
past and I am now trying to change that.
Subject: A Naive Plea
Posted: Tue Aug 28 06:17:13 1984
Geez.  This Ken Arndt guy annoys me.  Would you say that he's goading?
I don't mind him though.  (Never you mind.)
 
     * Thank you for not minding.  I guess you could say I am goading but
my last few postings have tried to goad only in the sense of eliciting
a reasoned reponse.  Why exactly are you annoyed?  If it is only because
I question your position then do you really have a right to be annoyed?
Or is it because I am requesting you to think through the consequences
of your beliefs and actions and you find that not to your liking?
But all that stuff about the lower intestinal tract, and bowels, and . . .
Uh, all that stuff.
      * I didn't get it from nowhere!  Where do you think it came from?
 
Excuse me, but, what has that really got to do with being gay?
Being gay doesn't mean you have a desire to engage in certain acts.
      *Sure!  I believe that. But now there's only two of us.
Being gay means you like cuddling with other guys.  That you really
enjoy their company.  Aren't there straights that engage in the acts
Arndt described?  I could swear I've read about stuff like that in
Penthouse's FORUM.  (I didn't get it, my mother did.  She gave a copy
to me and two college buddies to read on a long ferry ride.  She only
got it because she wanted to see the Miss America stuff.)  Are they
[the straights described in FORUM who engage in anal sex] just as bad,
in Arndt's view?
      * Indeed.  Heteros do do it and I (if you read my postings carefully)
        said the same things about them.  But again, the point is that 
        heteros have an alternative not available to homosexuals.
        (Send a stamped self-addressed envelope and I'll tell you
         what it is.)
 
Being gay is not about sex; it is about love and affection.
Or am I naive?
      * No, just silly.  Like Steve Dyer when he talks of what happens
        behind the bushes in the park between homosexuals as ""affection"".
        Either he has never been there or he is . . . silly too.
        A 1982 report by the American Medical Association's council on
        scientific affairs stated that ""Any person, of whatever sexual
        preference, who shows a dominant pattern of frequent sexual
        activity with many partners who are and will remain strangers,
        presents evidence of shallow, narcissistic, impersonal, often
        compulsively driven genital rather than person-oriented sex
        and is almost always regarded as pathological.""
 
        The movie recently mentioned on the net fills in the detail
        about ""affection"" in the park.
        You don't sound like that kind of person, by the way.
Mr. Arndt stirs my emotions.  It makes me defensive.  I certainly hope
I'm not a health risk.  I take precautions.  Mr. Arndt, why don't you
advocate that gays take care to insure that they minimize their chance
of getting AIDS?  I don't see where you get off knocking the Gay Men's
Health Crisis people.  If you're so concerned why don't you man one of
their hotlines?  Not your problem, huh.  Easier to criticize.
        * You a health risk?  What about the risk to YOUR health?
          But I DID speak out against PROMISCUIOUS homosexual and
          heterosexual behavior!  I invited the net to speak out as
          well.  The avoidance and silence is sorry to see.  I wasn't
          knocking the Health Crisis people per se, but the INCONGRUITY
          of their holding forth in a church.  My speaking out here IS
          an expression of my concern despite the poor manner in which
          I have presented my concern (jibes) and the hysterical (I don't
          know how else to express it) reaction I received.
Everyone takes health risks.  The air quality is low today.  Can I have
a sip of your Pepsi?  Buckle up.  How do those new headphones sound?
Gee, that looks good.  55 saves lives.  Look both ways.  Should we change
the sheets?  Are you gonna finish that?  Don't sit so close to the TV.
Boy, did you get tanned.  Biological.  Physical.  Chemical.  God Bless You!
          * So AIDS, etc. is just another health risk?  Tell it to those
            who have it.  Or to those who need blood transfusions!
            They aren't doing anything to warrant the risk they stand
            under!!!  Your behavior places them at risk.  
There are gay guys that choose to engage in activities which are currently
very risky.  Like anal sex with strangers.  These gay guys don't do things
like that because they are gay.  They do it because they are either stupid,
uninformed, or irresponsible.  Or maybe lost.  These things are unrelated to
being gay.  Being gay just has to do with whom you choose as your companion.
           * What about the stupid, uninformed, irresponsible non-gay men
             who engage in anal sex with strangers?  I mean where are they?
             Lost?? LOST??  You mean spiritually? Or mentally?
             Unrelated to being gay?  There are still only two of us!
             Who you choose as your companion - like my dog or my gun?
 
Also, Mr Arndt, attitudes like yours only make things worse.  How?  Well,
it goes like this.  Little Johnny is either going to be straight, or be gay.
           * Not according to the testimony of some of the netters!
There is no proven method for determining or setting this course.  There is
just nothing that has been shown to be effective in persuading Johnny about
whom he should choose for his companion.  BUT, you can have an effect on
how Johnny expresses his desires.  Attitudes like yours, Mr. Arndt, make
Johnny feel like a real worthless piece of shit.  If I were Johnny, and I
met you, I wouldn't feel so hot about myself.  So Johnny tries to go about
           * Hey, stop that!  I think that you are no doubt a hell of a guy!
             I think you are wrong in your judgements and actions on this
             issue but I can't evaluate you as a total person nor should I.
             That would mean I might be judged by my own standards and I
             wouldn't want that.  Though some people hate homosexuals I
             don't.  I don't like their program and what I see as self
             delusion as to what they are doing.
expressing his desires in ways that won't cause the people he loves to
suddenly hate him.  I'm not saying Mr. Arndt that YOU would disown your son
if you found out that he were gay.  It's just that, with the attitudes you
express, he would have good reason to believe that he might lose a little of
your affection for him.  You see, the persecution of gays is what causes
gays to do the things that the persecutors see as unfavorable.  If Johnny
knew deep down in his heart that you wouldn't have him any other way then
maybe he'd be proud to bring home the boy he met at the ice cream parlor.
To see if you approved of this boy.  To see how you felt about this boy
maybe becoming a part of the Arndt's extended family.  But no, Johnny
would never bring his ice cream parlor boy home to you Mr. Arndt.  In fact,
if you were Johnny's dad, Johnny would never be able to really love another
gay person because he would be filled with too much self-hatred.  Making
people hate themselves, and feel bad about themselves isn't good for anyone.
             * Hey, get down! This avoids the whole (main) issue of whether
               or not there is a difference between being gay or being a
               ---------(fill in the blank with something that it is wrong
               to be)  Your statements ASSUME gay is ok and I don't buy
               that point.  What if your son came home with other kids
               books, etc.  He's a compulsive taker!  Can't help it.
               I have to accept that, right?  Still only two of us.
Mr. Arndt, you don't make me feel good about myself.  You don't make me feel
good about being gay.  Why do you enjoy being so mean, huh?  I'm sorry, I
just don't ever see the greatest good being serviced by hate.  You seem to
have a lot of hate Mr. Arndt.  You may not think so, but ask around.  Your
heart certainly is not filled with love when you talk about gays.  Ah, but
that's not your problem & it's easier to criticize.
               * Hate!  Shit!  You mean I don't agree with what you are
                 doing.  My crime is that I say so and ask you to look
                 at what you are doing.  May you never meet real hate.
                 To you love means never saying someone else is wrong.
                 (Except if they don't agree with you.)
If you want to go on making people feel real bad about themselves, then just
keep doing what you've been doing Mr. Arndt.  It won't drive ME into the
bushes searching for a little self-affirmation of my worth.  I know what
you're up to.  But I sympathize with Johnny who feels so ultimately unloved
that he would rather risk death than face constant isolation of the soul.
               * Johnny's problem isn't that he's unloved, it's that he
                 is acting contrary to what those who love him think is
                 right and he won't accept anything less than that they
                 change their values to suit his.
Mr. Arndt, it's not that I don't like hearing about AIDS.  In fact I do;
after all, I want to know what I can do to avoid getting it.  But I don't
like hearing about it from you.  I don't think anyone thinks your looking
out for them when you send out your warnings about AIDS.  They're not even
warnings, they're taunts.
                * But are they facts?  Come on, to oppose you is to taunt
                  you, to question is to hate . . . .  How does one ask
                  about what you are doing???
I'm done now.  In the future I'll just 'n' over your articles unless I see
the word 'love' in the subject line.  You can use that as a cue to all us
net.motss'ers so we'll know when you've changed your tune.
Goodbye, Mr. Arndt.  It's been o.k. chatting with you.
I apologize to you for the public nature of this letter,
but my hope is that other people will benefit by reading it.
That's usually why I post articles.
                 * Your posting was great!!  Thanks.  Any time.  I think
                   highly of you while still not agreeing with you.  Can
                   you dig it??

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays.

MY understanding of the lesbian community is that there is a subgroup of

usually women like Ellen who consciously choose to be lesbians because they
think that men are creeps (to put it lightly).  From the litterature I've
read by some of these women, the point (or reason or whatever) of this
switch is to rediscover female sexuality which has been buried under male
propaganda of what sex should be like: foreplay + intercourse (+ washing

This view of sexuality is usually accompanied by a different philosophy of
how the world should be, a place where caring and emotions are important,

It also seems (and here I am not as aware of the actual reality as I am
in the case of lesbians, so correct me if I am wrong) that there is a
subculture in the gay culture which is the complete antithesis of this
lesbian ideal: power is the basis of sex and a great emphasis is put on
anonymousness, sex for sex' sake with no place for feelings, promiscuity
etc (i.e the image that most ""straights"" have of gays), in other words
everything that political lesbians loathe in ""straight"" men pushed to its
extreme.  
Obviously lesbians and gay men do have common interests since they are
both discriminated against by society at large, so as there is power
in numbers it is in their interest to join forces to try to achieve 
better rights in society.  However the philosophies of these two 
subgroups seem to be so irreconciliable (that of the political lesbians

gay men in general) that I wonder how they manage to work together when
their ideals are so different.  I was just curious as to whether this produces
a rift into the gay culture, whether these two subcultures just ignore

It would seem that there are similar ""subgroups"" of both types amongst both
lesbians and gays, although the notion of one's sexuality being construed as a
sociopolitical statement seems limited to some radical feminist lesbians. 
(Though I've met gay men who have made their decision based on similar ideals:
being gay because one feels little in common with the straight male community
and more in common with the gay community, as opposed to being gay because one
is simply and directly *attracted* to members of the same sex).
Months ago there was some sort of (very limited, apparently) discussion on
those who believed that lesbian S&M was ""politically incorrect"" (as if that
should have a bearing on how people choose to live their lives!!!), because it
DID perpetuate the male/female power relationship that women ""should""
(according to the proponents) be avoiding as lesbians.  I would think that
there are gays and lesbians both who seek in their relationships an avoidance
of standard social sex roles, and also that there are those who go to the
opposite extreme to emulate (almost in parody form) what they see in
male/female relationships. (S&M, both heterosexual and homosexual, seems to be
such an example carried to a very extreme extreme.  ""The Story of O"" always
seemed to me like a parable for this concept:  sexual relationships as
possession.)  I should point out that there exists the same dichotomy amongst
straight people, where some live out the ""expected"" roles (some push them to
the point of self-parody), and others reject them and seek very different sex
roles from the so-called norm.

I'd read that surveys showed that, generally, male homosexual relationships
*were* of the ""fleeting"", promiscuous variety, while lesbian relationships
tended to be more long-lived.  But, again, these are just generalizations.
Since Sophie had originally directed her questions at Steve and other
gays/lesbians who might be in an ""answering-questions-from-straights"" mood,
I'll shut up now and hopefully let that answering begin.

HOMOSEXUALS MAY RISK WEAK IMMUNITY  by Jon White
    Practices common among homosexuals may weaken their immune system, creating
an abnormality seen in AIDS patients, a study published Friday in the Journal
of the American Medical Association suggested.
    Another report in the Journal noted that 38 people have developed AIDS
following blood transfusions.
    The study lends support to the theories mtying homosexual practices to a
breakdown in immunity that causes AIDS.
    AIDS is aquired immunity deficiency syndrome, a condition in which a
person's normal body defenses against infection fail to function adaquately.
Patients with AIDS can become ill and die from infections that are easily
controlled by the immune systems of healthy people.  AIDS patients may also
develop cancers rarely seen in the general population.
    Since it was first seen by physicians in 1980, AIDS has been diagnosed
mostly in homosexual men, people who use intravenous drugs illegally, and,
to a lessor extent, Haitians and hemophiliacs.  It has been noted that homo-
sexuals with a high number of partners seenm to beat greater risk of AIDS than
those with fewer partners.
    The latest AIDS study, conducted at M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston,
found that even in men without symptoms of disease, anal intercourse is
associated with abnormalities of the immune system.
    The study, conducted by Dr. Giora mavligit and colleagues, focused on 30
asymptomic, monogamously paired homosexual men.  Nineteen of 26 men who were
recipiants of sperm anally showed laboratory evidence of an immune response
to their partner's sperm.
    No evidence of such a response was found in the four men in the study
who never received sperm during intercourse.
    The response in some of the men involved infection fighters called T-cells
and was the same kind of reation strongly associated with AIDS.  The
researchers also studied one heterosexual couple who regularly practice anal
intercourse and found signs of the same immune reaction in the female.
    These findings support the theory that sperm entering the the anal canal
are readily absorbed into a person's lymphatic and blood circulation systems,
where they may set up an immune response as if they were invading infectious
agents.

I cannot help but feel that there is a subtle ""political"" component in
the AMA article linking certain sexual practices with laboratory immune
deficiency disorders, and extrapolating that to the AIDS syndrome.  A bit
exaggerated, the argument goes as follows:
	""Subjects who participate in generally-considered-icky sexual
	practices show laboratory evidence of immune response to their
	partner's sperm.  Did someone say 'immune'?  Doesn't AIDS have to
	do with the immune system?  Could it be that people who engage in
	such vile practices might actually be bringing it upon themselves?
	Hear ye, and repent now.""
It reminds me a bit of Susan Sontag's expositions of the treatment of
tuberculosis and cancer patients in her book, ""Illness as Metaphor"".  The
chasm between labortatory-level immune system peculiarities and AIDS is
quite wide, especially given the epidemiological evidence which would seem
to implicate an infectious agent as the cause of AIDS.  We must remember
that the accused practice has been around for many millenia, as opposed to
AIDS, which has emerged only in the last three years.  
A similar study was published a few years ago implicating vasectomies in
auto-immune diseases.  In this case, men were showing symptoms of immune
reactions against their own sperm.  Now the researchers (presumably
themselves intact) weren't saying much about vasectomies and AIDS then, but
they were warning of arthritis and heart disease.  The fears stirred up by
that potboiler are only beginning to be dispelled by hard evidence showing
no increase in either disease in vasectomized men.
I should emphasize that I am not condemning basic research of any kind.
But a study's conclusions and presentations are not immune (sorry) to
deeply-ingrained bias.  Here, I'm trying to point out the ur-message
I see hiding beneath the respectable mantle of an AMA article.

theory, but it is MY current theory.  Please poke holes if you feel qualified.
	From the study in the JAMA article, there is reason to believe that
	sperm can trigger an immune response in the recipient when injected
	by anal intercourse.
	Through my limited exposure to reproductive biology (no giggling in
	the third row!), I seem to remember that, under regulation heterosexual
	intercourse, the woman's immune system is prevented from reacting
	to the invasion of the foreign sperm.  This could be effected by
 
		a) a change in the woman's immune system during intercourse
		   caused by
		      i) hormonal reaction to psychological stress
		     ii) some reaction to sperm chemistry, possibly accelerated
			 antibody-antigen immunity?
		b) a characteristic of sperm (haploidy? chemistry?) that renders
		   its genetic information ""acceptable"" to the female system.
	I believe that a combination of these mechanisms is responsible for the
	lack of immune activity.  In any case, a vestigal ""female system""
	of immunity to sperm may remain in men.  Such an intended temporary
	suspension of immune activity may malfunction when the injection is
	through another site, i.e. the colon, particularly in men, and possibly
	in women.
	Another possibility is that the immune and hormonal changes that
	occur in response to fertilization may also have vestigal analogues in
	men, although I don't know what a male system would misconstrue as a
	""fertilization.""  The normal changes in women occur so that the zygote
	will not be rejected.
Am I crazy or what?

     the  patrons furtively to spatter their ignorance and hatred upon
     its walls and slip away undetected,  never  having  been  exposed
     with  their  intellectual (if not actual) pants down.  This stuff
     is venom, glandular in origin and requiring periodic venting;  we
     can expect more of it.
          It is also instructive.   Our  anonymous  vandal  enunciates
     three now classic tenets of the hard-core homophobe :
        - Sexism. ""One man, one woman"", the order of the  subjects  is
          not incidental.
        - Equation of promiscuity with the *cause*  of  disease.   The
          insidious  shift from the term ""spreads"" to ""causes"" is par-
          ticularly pertinent in the  discussion  of  AIDS  where  the
          equation  is extended on the l.h.s. to include homosexuality
          itself and then, by the  transitive  property  we  have  ...
          (left  as  an  exercise;  the argument should be familiar by
          now).
        - Fear and loathing of same-sex sex.
     To my mind this last is the hardest nut to  crack.   Coming  out,
     however  daintily done, is fundamentally and irretrievably a sex-
     ual declaration.  And the imagination of  same-sex  sex  is,  for
     many  people, a private chamber of horrors and the source of much
     of the vitriol reserved for lesbians and gay  men.   Before  this
     will  change,  the  imagination at large must become educated and
     supple enough someday to embrace images and dreams of homosexual-
     ity and trade in them freely to dispel the squalour in the hearts
     and minds of folks like guest@sfucmpt.

horrors) of same-sex sex, but of sex itself. The old idea that sex is
nasty, terrible, sinful and wrong is rather well entrenched even among
people who claim to be liberated.
There are 2 extremes which you can find in any goup of 5 or more (randomly
selected) people, as far as I know. One is ""sex is so bad and horrible
that we really shouldn't do it"" and the other is ""well, if they say its
so bad, then it must be real good so i want lots and lots of it!"".
The strange thing is that these 2 camps, all the while, incite each
other on. The more people who find the thought of sex somewhat deadly
or repellent the more other people will thinkt hat it must be a commodity
that they should get more and more of. And by the time these latter souls
have discovered that ""to hell with relationships, there is nothing in life
but sex"" then they have pretty well justified the first groups claim about
how terrible and impersonal promiscuity makes you. And the cycle goes on,
and on, and on...
Meanwhile the whole society gets sex on the brain. And people like advertisers
encourage it. Sex gets mixed up with love, and power, and responsibility, and
counteless other things to the point where i am sure that archeologists
digging up Western Society 3 millenia from now are going to be convinced
that our whole lives were expressions of sex and sexuality.
And still we cannot talk about it!

I suspect that morality was developed (a long time ago) to keep society
from being wiped out by venereal disease.  Think about it.  Any society
with venereal disease that didn't limit sexual contact somehow would
eventually sterilize all the females and disappear.  Monogamy is 
reasonable and successful approach to the problem.  Note that societies
such as Polonesia that had no venereal disease (before the white man
came) were very promiscuous with no serious problems.  When syphlis and
gonorea were conquered by drugs and the pill came out, we thought free
sex was great, and it was.  The hidden problem arose when herpes and

The problem is the lingering presence of puritanical beliefs that
address the issue by creating taboos and fears around sex. These
beliefs often corelate sex with evil and create more curiosity for
young people than caution. When youngsters (boy, do I sound old!)
realize they can have sex without the devil branding them for life,
they tend to shrug off all words of authority. If we are more open,
honest and candid with our pubescent children (and with ourselves),
we will probably see an improvement in mature sexual attitudes.
(NOTE: mature sexual attitudes are not 1) fear of sex 2) rampant
promiscuity. sez me.)

			PART SIX
The Reagan AIDS record is pretty awful.  Here's an assortment of info
culled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack of
a) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.
[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted In
AIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]
By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate that
Ted Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-
tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" over
all federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to find
out what was going on.  Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of Health
Edward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTING
HSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  He noted:
	-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,
	   to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health official
	   was present, something that would clearly have a ""chilling
	   effect"" on the interviewee.
	-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & results
	   from HSGOH.
Brandt countered:
	-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".
	   Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-
	   ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" by
	   their boss, the Reagan administration.
	-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects
	   & victims.  This defense is particularly ironic: this fall
	   over 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extent
	   of HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT that
	   HHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurance
	   companies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!
	   In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriously
	   violates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones of
	   medical practice & civil rights.  The HHS is certainly aware
	   of this:  confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" of
	   CDC operations.
Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-
cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).
Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that
""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to say 
that that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"".  (In fact, 
AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)
18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-
demic was available from HHS.  Yet non-HHS sources regularly announced
new statistics, facts, & research results during this period.
Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:
The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position of
following, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the general
public, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created to 
deal with:  national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractable
ones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.
Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-
ation's even worse than that:  concerned organizations & even the legisla-
tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to move
on resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisions
about rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about the
HHS AIDS effort.
Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding the
administration budgeted for AIDS.
Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.
testified:  ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]
program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us look
as good as you can with what you've got.'""
Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels on
AIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged:  ""HHS has not convened
a single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from the
private sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't to
collaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""
Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those in
gov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers if
they state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicit
gov't gag orders.  University researchers equally clearly tell me that
they fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speak
their minds.  These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grants
in order to carry out their scientific research.""
Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physician
at U of C said:  ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDS
as bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federal
officials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simply
mouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-
ity.""

			PART FIVE
[Following is from Matthew Stadler's ""National News"" page in NYNative,
p. 7, 9/10-23/84]
The homophobia of the Reagan administration issues from more than
just its collective goals, its individual appointees, & the militant
homophobes with whom it's intimately allied politically:  it comes
from Reagan himself.  A recent example of this is a written state-
ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-
CARD & published there in August.
Reagan's statement read:
""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of
the bond between a man & a woman.  It is the means by which families
are created & society itself is extended into the future.  In the
Judaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wife
participate with God in the creation of a new human life.  It is for
these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to
protect this unique relationship.  In part the erosion of these 
values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most 
reject.  We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government
endorsement of homosexuality.""  [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quoting
NYTimes, 8/18/84]
The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-page
article detailing their objections to gay rights, among which were
the supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500
sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimming
before the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.
Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARD 
claimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least
10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--
& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is either
gay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-
ease cases:  72% of AIDS;  35% for hepatitis;  51% of throat gonor-
rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections.  According to the SCOREBOARD,
AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quoted
from NYNative, 9/10-23/84]
Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-
ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above to 
organizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" about 
homosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious 
& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatred
against gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??
Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-
self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,
inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-
paigns, etc.
But this shouldn't really come as a surprise.  Paul Laxalt, senator 
from Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-
man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent role
in Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATH
PENALTY for homosexuality.  (Laxalt is currently under investigation
for alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)

JC never mentions homosexuals in any context.  Paul, however, was not
a freethinker in any respect, and followed the Jewish legal tradition
quite strongly.  He may have been adding some these sorts of personal
prejudgements to his discourses (on totally different subjects).  That
is why such prejudgements need to reexamined periodically.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i. Paul's 'personal prejudgments' were, rather, traditional.
ii. It is 'personal prejudgment' to have Paul say what he plainly
	does not.
iii. Paul was 'freethinking' for his time, but this does not mean
	he would agree with anything we would like. Although he was
	formerly the student of a famous Pharisaic teacher, his
	understanding of Scripture and human psychology is remarkably
	'modern'; certainly his interpretations of Scripture are very
	figurative, instead of simply literal. Also, he did set aside
	many rules of traditional Jewish ritual Law, which he believed
	were less important ethically and theologically, which might
	cause non-Jews to stumble, so that they might listen to the
	Gospel. Finally, Paul said that while Christians had been
	set free by Christ, still not all things were good for them.
iii. Jesus cites Scripture that man and woman were created by God
	for each other. This is the traditional Jewish view, which one
	can misconstrue only if one is very obstinate.
iv. Jesus was not condemnatory of any sins, but merciful, so that
	all men, being sinners, might come to repentance. It is
	mercifulness, rather than vengeance, which leaves open the
	possibility of repentance. Vengeance hardens our hearts.
v. The primary point is that if Jesus had approved, even privately,
	of homosexuality, no matter what is recorded in the NT
	writings, this would have been so scandalous to the
	contemporary Jewish society, notably to the religious leaders,
	that we would certainly be informed about it according to
	orthodox Jewish tradition. I stand on this.
vi. I should say that my purpose in making these observations is
	to make clear that no one can plausibly suggest that Jesus,
	or Paul, approved of homosexuality. However, Jesus certainly
	did not persecute anyone. And those who do are not like him.
vii. Faith is said to be a gift of God, but for those who would
	desire it. Jesus could only heal the spiritual afflictions
	of those who sought his help, who would desire faith, as in
	the saying, ""Lord, help my unbelief,"" and the ultimate
	petition of Mass, based on the faithful petition even of a
	Gentile centurion, ""Lord, I am not worthy to recieve you, but
	only say the word, and I shall be healed.""
viii. I believe that the churches should help to secure the human rights
	of all individuals, including rights to assembly, speech, religion,
	voting, employment, and housing. I believe that homosexuals should 
	not be excluded from congregations, anymore than are sexually
	promiscuous persons. And although they may elect to exclude them-
	by a sort of self-excommunication, the consequences of enforced
	separation may be harmful to someone who would otherwise change
	in the course of time and fellowship. We should be patient, rather
	than condemnatory; by excluding or persecuting others, we are
	condemning them, since therefore they cannot not come to change.
viii.Most Christians simply believe that God has created mankind with the
	intention of heterosexuality; one may not believe in the divine
	creation, but our anatomy and reproduction alone suggest very strongly
	that evolution has selected for phenotypic heterosexuality -- other-
	wise we would suffer self-extinction very quickly. For someone who

I question the use of most in the above paragraph.  Do you mean most
Christians?  If so, while potentially true, this is the very point
that we are pushing to have reexamined.  Do you mean most cultures?
This is not true.  Do you mean most people today?  This is the work
of the Christian Church, and demonstrates why this belief must be
changed.  As for homosexuality being self-destructive, that is an
opinion you seem to hold that has no justifications here.  Prove it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As you already first observe, and as the context suggests,
""most"" means ""most of the living body of Christians.""
	Do I have to prove this to you? Do you yourself want to live
as a large proportion of homosexuals do?
	I am simply giving my opinion based on discussion with homosexual
individuals, 20 or so, over 20 years, also based on listening to televised
discussions by physicians who are said to be expert. My impression is
that the rates of suicide, drug abuse, promiscuity, transience, infection,
and death are considerably higher among this population than among non-
homosexual groups, especially married persons. Certainly, the health and
happiness of those with whom I talked was not good, even according to them.
The thing I always wondered was -- how can you live this way? And why?
	If you do not believe me, then ask your doctor to recommend 
unbiased physicians at a medical school who are expert in public health.
Then report this survey to the Net.
	You should understand that nearly everyone who is not homosexual,
not matter how liberal or religious, recommends against this life. Further-
more, as I have been informed by Indian and Chinese friends, who are from
ancient countries representing 1/3 of world population, homosexuality is
not accepted, and rare among these comparatively restrictive cultures. 
Neither do Muslim nations, who represent another very large proportion, 
accept this. All these tradtionally reject it. One has to go back to 
pagan Greek and Roman days to find such widespread acceptance. You are
very mistaken.

You seem to believe that all or most gays live their lives in bathhouses,
and I have to say that that belief is completely incorrect.  Unless
you had friends and/or aquaintances who were openly gay, your big city
experiences with gays have been confined to people who were out partying.
Isn't making a judgement on such a skewed sample a little brash?  I mean,
I'm involved in a relationship that has been ongoing for 4 1/2 years.
I supported my lover through school.  Many gays are actively involved
in charity efforts, upgrading their neighborhoods, politicing for
minority rights, etc.; are these self-destrutive?  I know lots of
gays in stable relationships (just to point out that I am not a strange
exception).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I said what I meant: here I am addressing the general problem of 
promiscuity, whether it is heterosexual or homosexual. Of course, I am
not commenting on where you can find it.
	Like you also, I believe that all of us are capable of doing good,
and of responding to the needs of others. But we do this because we
are human with conscience, not because we are gay or not, perfect or
not. You are saying that gays are human beings capable of good, and I
completely agree that none of us should forget this.
	If you and your friends are not 'promiscuous', then are you really
representative of most homosexuals?
	We all want to have secure relationships with others; the question
is -- what sort of relationship are we securing? Is it to be recommended
to young people? Whether or not it is 'voluntary', is it to be recommended?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While I do not contend that all gays are of benefit to their communities,
I do contend that statements such as those in the above paragraph are at
best unsubstantiated dreck, and are more likely to be considered
rabble-rousing and hate mongering.  Because while you claim to be so
enlightened as to not persecute gays, it is a short step from ""they
are self-destructive"" to ""we must protect them from themselves so
that they can be saved"" to ""put gay people in concentration camps so
that they don't infect our children"" by people not as enlightened as
you claim to be.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	There are two points made in my article, one about Christian 
tradition, the other about my opinion. You dislike my opinion, which
is that homosexuality is self-destructive, that it should not be
approved by the churches, but that no one should persecute anyone,
but treat everyone as an individual who has fallen short, but is
capable of change for the better.
	I've found good qualities in almost everyone, but I would
certainly not recommend everyone's life to others.
	I am not speaking to rabble -- I am speaking to you, without
compromise but also without aspersion. Those who would persecute
others will find no encouragement in what I say, unless they would
distort what I've said. We should always keep in mind what Jesus
said about the adulterer: consider that you who would condemn
this one are also sinners; I have not condemned this one; the one
should stop sinning. This was the new, more merciful commandment
which, it is said, he stooped to write on the earth with his
finger, even as it is said that the Lord God descended at Sinai to
write with His finger on the stone tablets of men's hearts.
	Being homosexual as you are, also does not make you very
'enlightened' I'm afraid. Besides this, it almost certainly does not
mean the same thing to you as it does to me. To begin with, it is
said that the life of Christ is the light of mankind. How many are
living as he did? Also, as you may not know, the Greek word for
'enlightenment' was, in very early Christian writings, used to
refer to baptism, in the sense of the experience at conversion,
or initiation. (It was also similarly used by the pre-Christian 
Essene Jews at Qumran.) What is your initiation? What has set you
on your way?  But my point is that the expression 'enlightenment'
has a specific religious meaning, which you do not appreciate, and
is generally confused with a quality of opinion.",z1jNJIRnbCUJ,18,1985-03-31,10,2

As I stated in my previous article, much of the unhappiness of gay people,
evident in the above symptoms, is due to the oppression we suffer rather
than being intimately connected to homosexuality.  As for how I can live
""this way"", I cannot live any other way than gay.  ""Why?"" you ask, so that
the gay people who come after me don't have to suffer such shit.  Finally,
a sample size of ""20 or so"" is a very small sample to base such a judgement
on out of the 30,000,000 or so homosexuals in the United States... obviously
most of the homosexuals that you have met didn't trust you enough to mention
it.

You forget that 15% of *all* men are gay or bisexual, actually I doubt you
forget, but wish to conviently brush the facts aside.  You are right about
the fact that many non-gays recommend against a gay lifestyle, *mostly due
to Christian spread intolerence* however.  I don't even recommend it, if one
can be straight, one may save ones life, job, home and health by not being
gay and thereby incurring the wrath of bigots.

15% of all male children will grow up to be gay/bisexual.  Is it healthy
to teach children that the life they will lead is somehow sick, evil, etc?
No.  Isn't this a method of making sure that they will have problems for the
rest of their lives?  Yes.  Will it change their orientation to tell them
such things?  No.  Will some of the larger percentage of children that
aren't gay take these concepts about gays and use them to justify going
out and ""bashing queers"" and otherwise denying gays human rights.  Yes.
Do you wish to continue the cycle?

Perhaps the Christians who used it that way were enlightened.  Some
Christians today are enlightened, but certainly you are not one of those.
Quit trying to use some obscure definition of the word enlighten as
*the* definition.  What enlightened me, by the way, was having to
live with prejedice every day of my life.  Since one of the major
teachings of JC that I still believe and use in my own religious/moral
code, is that you should love your neighbor as yourself.  Since I do
not like prejedice against myself, I assume that my neighbor doesn't
either.  Therefore, I try to enlighten others, like you, who are in

       The hammer blow that will drive homosexuals and the
       'gay lifestyle/rights movement' underground again is
       the current health crisis (of which AIDS is only the
       tip of the iceberg) among homosexuals, especially in
       New York and San Francisco but spreading, who follow
       a particularly promiscuous path to fulfillment and
       the impending breakout of that health crisis into the
       population at large.  Given the same kinds of events
       (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can
       be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual
       lifestyles.  In fact, some sexually related health
       problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros.
       The point to be taken is however that these diseases
       are not seen as coming into the general population from
       an identifible minority.  They are caused by a behavior
       by and large and not passed like the flu.  On the other
       hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed 
       without the vehicle of homosexual behavior.
       The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality
       per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out
       against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because
       of the consequenses to us all.  Homosexuals no less than others,
       need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle
       the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex.
       As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often
       expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals
       do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting
       adults do.
       If the general public IS infected with these diseases from
       the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall.  Remember
       how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against
       Swine Flu from such a small amount of information?
First, what is a sexually promiscuous person?  Kinsey guessed that the
average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime.  The Village
Voice put the figure at 1600.  Others (from the homosexual community)
have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be
extraordinary.
As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house
and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting
each other with a variety of diseases.  This realization is dawning upon
the gay community.  It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves
who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier
this year.  To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take
away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a
diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now
reside within the gay community.  The bulk of enteric (intestinal)
diseases is now within the gay community.""
What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on
the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a
growing number of young men and women.  A 28 year old AIDS victim from
New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that
sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown
of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight 
off infections we normally have no problem with.  Today it is conservatively
estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which
40% have already died.  But the real horror comes with the following
information!!  It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons
with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating
the disease.  AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO
FOUR YEARS!!!!  
Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25%
of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS).""  IF this
represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and
that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change,
the gay community is on self-destruct.                               
 
What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the
National Institutes of Health?  They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3,
as a possible cause.  (It may not be the only cause!)  Some research
physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred
by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds.""
 (New York Times)
But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS
it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS
homosexuals!!!!  Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and
a vaccine is years away.
Unfortunately the litany must go on.  There are today incubating within
the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly
considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the
general population.  They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"":
            -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites.  Causes
                        dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually
                        picked up from contaminated food.
            -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea.
                         Spread in a similar way.
            -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause
                          severe dysentery.  In children, can be fatal.
                          Contaminated food is the usual cause.
            -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or
                          non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination:
                          e.g., food, water, and close person to person
                          contact.
GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding
pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the
wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of
these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis
(they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have
SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES.
In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in
San Francisco.  It has gotten worse since!  In NY as well.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco
an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or
shigellosis were employed as food handlers.  Between 60% - 70% of these
persons were homosexuals.  How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals
to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try
to screen them out?  What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers,
day care centers, etc, etc.?
We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among
homosexuals who are promiscuous.
Well enough.  Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should
be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among
their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs.
May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan
and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much
of this article was taken.

Well, that figure seems to be indicative of the value of Arndt's entire
article--just one more piece of bilious hatred, with a (vain) attempt to
cover it over with invented statistics.  If any thinking person wanted (for
whatever reason) to attack the gay community, it wouldn't take the form of

Ha-ha! Do you purposely ignore the distinction, or are you unaware
of it? By homosexuality we mean lifestyle more often then preference
or orientation. Those are NOT same things as was indicated by many
people on this very net. No matter what a Haitian does he/she would
still be Haitian. They are born this way - enough said. You puffing
is not enough to prove same thing about gays.

It's most likely a viral infection, spread by a variety of mechanisms
including sexual contact.  Although the gay community has had a higher
incidence of it to date, cases have been reported among heterosexual
partners of infected individuals.  This in turn raises the likelihood
of eventual spread to the population as a whole, with incidence patterns
similar to other sexually transmitted diseases.
I should stop here, since I've obviously explained it, but that's not what
you're asking.  Instead, I'll ask you a question:  does being a Haitian
hurt other people?  Maybe we should nuke Hispaniola (and take out the
Dominican Republic while we're at it; they're too close)?  If you still
don't see my point, I'll be even more explicit:  when a crime is committed,
do you blame the criminal or the victim?  In the case of AIDS, I blame the

Thank you.  But please be even more specific, quoting the recommendations
verbatum so that those of us who want to may respond to the report rather 
than to a mixture of their suggestions and your suggestions.  Since most 
of us don't have the report *yet*, you can facilitate non-flame discussion 
by posting this.
Some of what you present in this posting (ie closing loopholes re pedophiles) 
is reasonable enough to discuss in terms of how it can be implemented without 
undesirable side-effects (such as accidentally outlawing family-oriented 
nudist magazines by defining child-pornography too broadly, as one proposed 
law would have done).

Not sure I caught that, could you also please include (briefly) how the
*Miller* standard differs from the unprosecutable *Roth* standard.  Just
so we know what is being recommended.  (If you said earlier, I forgot it).

In case it isn't obvious, my request is for quotes of the *action* 
recommendations, as calls for more study are not contoversial.  
References to studies, page numbers, etc, will be a good idea later, 
when more of us (presumably) will have cheap copies of the report.

At the present time, I believe that only adults over 18 can legally appear in
a porn film.  I always thought this was because we assume that someone of that
age is mature enough to take responsibility for their actions.  If that is not
true, then we have other, much larger problems.  When someone believes in their
convictions and is honest about themselves up front, there are no ""skeletons in 
the closet"" that can be dragged out later, and hence no embarrassments.

In more than one of the ""skin"" magazines I have read, there are write-in sec-
tions that DO answer questions, address disease protection and so forth, dispel-
ling myths and performing a definite educational function.  Some of the most
comprehensive articles about ""safe sex"" (regarding AIDS) that I have seen ap-
peared in Hustler magazine.  I guess that those type of magazines are the only
forum where sexual situations can be discussed in *frank terms*.

This is not what I think of when I think of pornography.  I have not been ex-
posed to this type of material, although I'm sure it exists for those willing
to spend the effort to find it.  This seems to be a good place to reiterate my
request to help break the connection between sex and violence.  One way to aid
this campaign is to not use the two terms together.  Try to replace the stan-
dard phrase ""sex AND violence"", with ""sex OR violence"" wherever possible.  It
seems like such a small thing, but I don't know of a better way to start.

	Message-Id: <851119190...@ubc-cs.UUCP>
	Will,  further to your AIDS article,
	Considering the amount of semen that ""leaks out"" before climax, is it
	really true to say that fellatio without taking ejaculate is
	possibly safe?  I trust your information, but I'd like to know why
	this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on
	cunnilingus?  I don't think you mentioned it in your article.
	     Thanks for a reasoned posting.
The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from
the Cowper's gland.  Noone really knows right now if this emission
can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any
mucuous membranes to it.
In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of
fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any
emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum.""  Lick *around* the
""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum),
rather than putting it all in your mouth.  To further decrease risk,
gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see
which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say
1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it
sit around for more than a few hours).  Most detergents kill the HTLVIII
virus, especially in combination with hot water.
Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking
the condom, rather than the penis directly.
As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information
as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide,
i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

things, peroxide, is simply illadvised, bad folk-medicine, something we
certainly don't need right now when it comes to AIDS.  There are lots of
agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective
or deleterious when used in vivo.  I am repeating myself here (I addressed this
several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this:
There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any
effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection.  Ditto for peroxide.  Nonoxynol-9
is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through
some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes.  Peroxide is
immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a
weak antiseptic agent by any standards.  The point is, we just don't know
the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against
infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that
there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it.  Better to not be
exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there
is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence.

Only if you practice celibacy or have a single partner who only lusts
after you.  It turns out that we are just getting started with AIDS.
It has been a problem a little longer in Africa - there, heterosexuals have
the same relative disease rate as homosexuals.

their lives and yours.  Talk about this openly; it's a
matter of life and death.  If you love someone, you owe
them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not

Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most
likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS.  That simply isn't true.
It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is
people who share needles and people who engage in sexual
practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through
mucous membrance contact.  The more peoples' membranes
you contact, the more likely you are to get it.
In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease.  In Europe,
AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.

Safe or very low risk:
* Social (dry) kissing
* Hugging
* Body massage
* Non-genital petting
* Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral)
* Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual)
* S & M (without bruising or bleeding)
* Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them)
Possibly safe:
* French (wet) kissing)
* Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load)
* Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide)
* Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide)
* Urine contact (""golden showers""  -- unbroken skin only)
Unsafe:
Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom
Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally
Oral-anal contact (rimming)
Manual-anal contact (ass play)
Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label).
It kills the virus in quite low concentrations.
If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing
with them when you masturbate.  Then, when you get together
with a partner, you'll be more used to how they feel and work.
With care, sex can be as fun as ever!

Anyway, I do have a question about the original posting.
What's the criterion that's used for distinguishing between
'possibly safe' and 'safe' acts? Are 'possibly safe' acts
ones that have not caused any known cases of aids but may
as far as we know lead to transmission of the virus? Or what?

And it also affects birdwatchers and music-lovers and unix-wizards.
So why choose to pollute OUR group with this mindless drivel quoted
out of the New York Post or some similarly inane publication?  I mean,
you people are only displaying your tasteless reading habits (but then,
so am I by continuing to subscribe to this newsgroup).  Now if the 
posting were about something which affected only women, then it would
make some sense.  How about a posting on how *pregnancy* is incurred,
with detailed descriptions of sex acts.  Go on.  I DARE you. Nyaa-Nyaa-Nyaa.

Oh, HIM!  I treasure the memory of ALL of the sex-acts I've performed
Matt Crawford!  HA!  Now I can leave you wondering whether I've 
actually performed sex acts with Matt Crawford;  remember, my 
statement remains logically correct and true even if I have never
lepton his hadron, excited his fundamental modes, accepted an
injection of hot magma into my steaming caldera, intersected his
orbital, or even licked his throbbing popsicle.  
I will still maintain that a discussion of AIDS is inappropriate
for this newsgroup, not because it affects more men than women,
but because it is fundamentally absurd to assume that a classification
of people based on sex makes sex a primary concern.

If they are shared by both sexes then definitely.  There is a newsgroup called

that these issues are NOT to do with women alone so keep your accusations to

=============
[ from 9/8/85 Boston Globe, p 22, ""Congress moving on AIDS issue"" by Steven
  Waldman, States News Service.  Quoted without permission. ]
The avalanche of media coverage of AIDS precipitated by Rock Hudson's
case has apparently stirred Washington to action, but different branches
of gov't are reacting quite differently.
Congress is being constructive: the House Appropriations human services
subcommittee ""voted to double to $140 million"" funding for research at
NIH ""and provide an additional $27 million for public education on AIDS
in 1986.""  Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chair of the House Energy & Commerce
health & environment subcommittee, ""will introduce legislation that would
prevent anyone from obtaining the records of those"" whose blood tests for
HTLV-III are positive.  But Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee
that oversees the Dept. of Health & Human Services, says concern about the
budget deficit will prevent ""any large federal commitment to treatment.""
And the executive branch & a local judiciary contemplate repression: 
Health & Human Services ""will...recommend that labs inform blood donors
who show possible signs of AIDS that their names may be released to
outsiders.""  The Florida Supreme Court is ""considering a suit that could
open up the [blood donor] records to public inspection.""
This represents a drastic broadening & worsening of the situation.  Only
weeks ago the American Red Cross retreated from its historic commitment
to donor confidentiality by allowing its local chapters to decide whether
they'd conform to a military demand to hand over HTLV-III bloodtest results
for all military personnel.
Finally, ""the American Council of Life Insurers Board of Directors,
meeting this week in California, is likely to recommend that firms use
the HTLV test to assess the risk of an applicant...""
It now looks like AIDS policy will be determined by politics, not medical
or legal guidelines.  It's time to write & lobby our representatives and
maybe contribute to political action, to prevent gross public & private
violations of rudimentary civil rights & liberties and professional ethics.
FOSTER CARE
===========
For New Englanders, yesterday's Boston Globe Magazine contained a long
article by free-lancer Anita Diamant, ""In the best interest of the child-
ren."" It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay foster
parents in question) which included interviews.
The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-
paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protection
for homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest of
the child.'""
Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law that
would explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,
or adoption.  The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priority
to ""traditional families.""
The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.
Michael Dukakis a while ago:  the Duke was very solicitous, pledging
support for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regretting
the treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia.  He ended by
reiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which puts
gays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)!  An amazing
performance.  My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)
attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""
he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due to
the zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, but
I have no news; does anyone else?).

Ridiculous!  If the military wants to test all their people; that's fine.
If the military wants to give all HTLV-III positives an honorary medical
discharge (I'm talking major paranoia here), then that is fine, too; but
they should NOT be able to \demand/ anything from Red Cross.

This one I totally agree with -- what's the difference between this and
people with high bloodpressure, diabetes tendencies, etc.?  It is the
insurance companies' right to assign risk based on present and/or
highly-possible disease.

AIDS policy will be determined by accurate and widespread info from believable
sources (i.e., by quelling paranoia with facts from people that are respected;
major newscasters, for example).  Until we get that info and get it widely
disseminated, AIDS policy will be determined by paranoia and misinformation.
I cringed when I saw the very informative article in TIME magazine, information
content looked quite good, but there on the first page was a BIG picture of
the guy whose wife and child had caught AIDS from him.  I know TIME, Inc.
is on the net -- if anyone sees the author(s) of that article please tell
them I think they should be shot for such yellow journalism.

What's wrong with insurance companies using HTLV-III bloodtests
to assess applicant risk for life insurance?  The danger is that
test results will be used to deny coverage, & not just raise
premiums:  Rep. Ted Weiss (D-NY), chair of the subcommittee that
oversees Health & Human Services, expressed this fear, but my
posting did not mention it.
If results were used to deny coverage or put an astronomical price
on premiums, most gay men in many urban areas would be effectively
denied life insurance.  Rates of positive test results among gay men
have been as high as 70-80% according to surveys in a number of large
US cities.
There have already been recorded instances of people denied medical 
insurance coverage (& life insurance, too, I think) merely because
it became known they tested positive.
Even the military case isn't uncontroversial: despite catch-22, the
military can't simply do anything it wants, at least not without
serious challenge.  If the military has a justification for HTLV-III
testing, it would be specific, such as avoiding contact with blood
& blood contacts plentifully available in combat or even in some 
forms of training.  But it wouldn't extend to noncombat personnel 
or civilian employees.

I still don't see any problem as long as the rate increases are well-
correlated with the chances of contracting AIDS if one tests positive
and with the chances of death resulting from contracting AIDS.

Or that they admittedly don't know enough about AIDS transmission yet
to risk the human and legal dangers of forcing non-HTLV-III-positive
persons to share barracks and combat training and common wash areas
and etc. etc. with persons who have tested positive.  I know this is
REALLY stretching things to make an analogy, but imagine you are told
that you must continue to stay in a barracks where there is a very mild
flea problem but you know that some of the fleas have been shown to carry
bubonic plague...
My original point stands -- smokers pay more insurance than non-smokers,
people in certain [often NECESSARY] high-risk jobs pay much more insurance.
If I was an insurance company (I HATE insurance companies, BTW; just trying
to be unbiased here), I would view a male positive-HTLV-III homosexual with
just as jaundiced (from an insurability standpoint) an eye as I would a
professional highwire performer.  The highwire performer will probably not
use a net and the gay guy will probably not refrain from anal sex.  All it
means to me is that I'm going to pay through the nose when they croak.
I think that the real horror of AIDS is that even when a cure/serum is
developed it will take 2 or 3 years to hit the market due to the FDA red tape
-- I think it is highly criminal that a patient, particularly a terminal
patient, often cannot get a doctor to use them as a guinea pig for a new drug
or technique.  I for one would be VERY upset if I knew that I had a chance
to raise my probability of living from 0 to .3 but couldn't get anyone
to help me do so due to legal restraints.
BTW, I suppose I should have said 'admitted homosexual' above; have you
noticed how even the 'responsible' press ALWAYS uses that adjective
'admitted'?  No wonder it took so long to get funding for AIDS...

""Navy Gives Dishonorable Discharge to AIDS victim"" NY NATIVE 9/2/85
""San Diego, CA"" - A Navy Corpsman diagnosed with AIDS in May, has been dis-
charged form the Navy because of homosexuality, despite his objection that
he is not homosexual and despite Army and Air Force policy that AIDS victims
be given medical discharges. The decision means that Corpsman Bryon Kinney,
whose discharge is dishonorable, will be denied medical care benefits.
""The decision came at an administrative hearing in July where no media coverage
was allowed and Kinney's attorney's were not permitted to present their case.""

NY Native, 9 Sept. 85 - Nationwide Insurance seeks to deny policies to gays
""Columbus, Ohio - The Trenton  times reported Aug 16 that the Columbus based
Nationwide Insurance Company has begun screening male applicants in states
with high incidence of ADIS to determine if they are gay. Lou Fabro,
director of public relations for the $3.5 billion company, told the Times,
'If an applicant is a potential homosexual, the underwriters have ways of
finding out. We can deny coverage. We wouldn't tell them why, we would
just say they didn't qualify.'
""Fabro later retracted the statement, telling the Associated Press it was
'taken out of context.'  He added, 'Nationwide does not deny coverage to
homosexuals. We couldn't do that. But if we are suspicious that a person
is promiscuous ,since only  promiscuous people get AIDS. The Times reported
that Nationwide checks for evidence of homosexuality by interviewing neighbors,
checking for male roommates, checking for male beneficiaries on other policies,
and by running credit checks.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of AIDS
A Great Time for defensive living.
It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance for
anything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one's
own social values on someone else's.  It was the age of the
trivialization of sex.  It was the age of anticelibacy. It was the
age when early teenage sex was commonplace.  It was the age 
when homosexuality came out of the closet and became almost 
acceptable to those who once found it intolerable.  It was the 
age of easy,  irresponsible  oversex,  abortion on demand,
chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.
   Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among the
French, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox among
the American Indians has there been a threat of such a
scourge.  Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is different from any disease previously seen clinically and
epidemiologically.  After the torrents of words that have been
written and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, is
there anything else to say?  Yes, a great deal.  Thus, this is
another JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWS 
stories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a case
report, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,
and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of this
gargantuan problem.
   The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this new
challenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientific
information.  The salient points are:
   1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has been
given three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.
   2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus become
infected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) who
become infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.
   3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to and
promote infectivity of the virus.
   4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected person
many years before the onset of clinical manifestations.
   5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,
infection, and clinically manifest disease.
   6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method to
determine who has been exposed to the virus but it does not
make the diagnosis of AIDS.
   7. A very high percentage of those who develop the 
full-blown disease die.
   8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,
and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.

[Two columns on 'The Dilemma of Serological Testing']

[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]
:
  Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, it
may behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS to
adjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --
particularly in the sexual arena.  Individuals have the power to
protect themselves more than science currently can.  As far as 
we know, prevention is fairly simple.
   1. We should not inject blood or blood products that are
infected by the AIDS virus into another person.
   2. We should not share injection needles with someone who
is infected.
   3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should not 
become pregnant.
   4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, or
vaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.
   5. We should consider instituting serological testing for 
HTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.
   This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.

in a net dispute.
AIDS wasn't a ""disease of male promiscuous homosexuals"".  Aside from
striking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-
sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unless
Lundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not what
most people mean by that term.  Given the long latency of the virus
(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-
ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they do
greatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago.  I've
heard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships for
years, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-
selves how or why they got it.  Some AIDS cases seemingly resulted
from a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility of
individuals may be involved here.
This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even within
a sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-
sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ).  Every-
one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informed
about AIDS.
Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III is
absurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.
Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medical
article or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?

The root gamos meant marriage, and as a modern combining-stem it usually
means mate or partner.  (In some botanical terms it means joined.)  For
people who use it strictly to talk about literal marriage, I suppose it
does imply heterosexuality, given the current laws about marriage.  But
for those who use it to refer to SO-ship or even to any sexual partnering,
it doesn't seem to carry that implication.    (Though I do take bigamy and 
polygamy to apply only to official marriage, and hence imply heterosexuality.)
	The modern combining-stems that are specifically male and female
would be -andr- and -gyn-.  They don't seem to combine with mono-, but
note the full range of three with poly- :
	polygamist - person with more than one spouse
	polygynist - man with more than one wife
	polyandrist - woman with more than one husband
(The last two formulations reflect what I think is the general use of these
to refer only to official marriage.)

I have a friend that I have been going out with for some time now.
For the most part it has just been recreational (read ""no sex"") and
fun.  One evening after making the rounds of a few clubs and such we
wound up back at her place and I decided to try to move the
relationship in a more intimate direction.  It was at this point 
that she informed me that she has genital herpes, hence the strictly 
recreational relationship. She was interested in the physical side
of a relationship but thought it only fair to let me know what was
what.  Being rather confused and unsure of how to act, I mellowed
out and we talked about it for a while without my coming to any
conclusions.

has come up in this light before and so I beg your forgivness if it
is old hat to some of you.  I back-pedaled and read all of the
herpes & kids articles that were still available to me and they left
me all the more confused.  There are two kinds of herpes (as far as
i know). One kind that includes cancre sores, cold sores and sty's
(sties??) in the eyes.  The other kind is genital herpes.  The
first, herpes simplex one, is something that most everyone contracts
at one point or another, I am still subject to it occasionally; no
big deal.  The other scares me.  I intend to do some research on the
physical aspects, but would like to do some research on the cultural
aspects as well. I think the net would be a good place to start.
Therefore I am interested in what you think.  Would you date, sleep
with, or attempt to carry on a serious relationship with someone
that has the disease?  Do you have any direct experience with the
disease or someone who has it that you would be willing to share?
Do you have anything else to contribute on the subject?
I realize that this is a very touchy subject and I would rather you 
reply through the mail if it means keeping your mouth shut out of
fear.  If I recieve anything worthwhile I will post it and will 
maintain confidentiallity.

It used to be clear that HSV-I was oral and HSV-II was genital, but these
days with as much oral sex as occurrs, there is no guarantee that you won't
get HSV-II from oral contact.  Stress is a major factor in reoccurrance of
outbreaks of Herpes.  It is also the case that some percentage of those
infected may have nearly permanent remission (cessation of outbreaks).  Another
factor in recurrance is diet.  It tends to be a personal pattern, where some
may have weekly outbreaks, and some may never again have an outbreak after
the initial infection.  It is possible for a woman to have active genital
herpes (either HSV-I or HSV-II) without necessarily being aware of it, if it
is internally active.  For this reason, the worst affect of herpes is the
restriction of promiscuity for women with genitally located HSV.
There are social organizations for the sufferers of HSV to meet each other.
It ain't the end of sex, but it can interfere with promiscuity, which may
be of some concern to some singles.  There is no substitute for openness and
honesty when it comes to these matters.

It IS possible to have sex with a person with herpes with minimal risk,
if proper precautions are taken.  Look into it.
My major observation:  I really LIKE to hear about someone being
so honest and straightforward.  If a woman I was interested in made
this declaration,  I would get be VERY interested in getting to know
her better.
Note also, that if she is concerned about your catching herpes,  she
is obviously willing to cooperate in the steps necessary to prevent
that from happening.

trade for something else.  I can think of two possible reasons why
this is so.
First reason: ""Nice girls don't like sex""
    In most parts of Western culture, promiscuity is a mark of high status
for men and a mark of low status for women.  This is not something I like,
but this is the way the world works (at least, to a large extent).
One context in which this idea is especially visible is rape.  If a
promiscuous woman is raped, some people believe that she deserves it or
that she asks for it, and many lawyers defend rapists using this idea.
A good example of a promiscuous man with high status is James Bond.
    There is more systematic evidense.  When asked how many partners they
had slept with, heterosexual women  generally gave lower answers than
heterosexual men in a survey I read about once.  If everyone had been
accurate (assuming that a representative group of people were questioned),
the number of partners should have been the same for women as for men,
on the average.  Since they were not the same, either women were
underestimating or men were overestimating or both.
    Because sex is a mark of low status, many women have convinced themselves
that they do not enjoy it.  A very attractive friend of mine, who often found
that men wanted to sleep with her, said she never reached orgasm in bed, and
just lay there waiting for the man to come and hoping it would not take too
long.  I find this rather sad, but it is fairly common.  Do not assume that
every woman will enjoy sex as much as you do.  She may feel so guilty about
it that she either doesn't enjoy it or cannot admit to herself that she enjoys
it.  A woman who feels this way probably feels that if she does something
which lowers her status and which she doesn't enjoy for your sake, she should
get something in return for that.
Second reason: babies
    No form of birth-control works 100% of the time.  This may be true even
if one thinks one is using it correctly.  For example, if a woman is taking
the pill and she also takes some kinds of antibiotic (tetracyclin, for one),
the pill will not work as well as it would normally.  MANY DOCTORS DO NOT
KNOW THIS.  Certainly most women don't.  Rubbers may break.  Cervical caps
may slip out of place.  IUDs may be expelled without the anyone realizing
it.  If two people sleep together, they always risk making a baby.
(I assume that most single people don't want a baby.)  It is easier for
a father to deny that he has any connection with his child than it is for
a mother.  I'm not, for a moment, implying that all men would do this
but proving paternity is not trivial, and when parents do not live
together, the children are usually the responsibility of the mother.
Therefore, if a woman sleeps with you, she will probably want some kind of
assurance that you will be around if a baby results.  Since there wasn't any
birth-control during most of the time humans were evolving, this kind of
manipulation probably improved the survival of the offspring.  Again, I'm
not saying that I like this arrangement, it's just the way the world works.
Advice:What if you want to sleep with someone
    If you would like to sleep with a woman and you want the desire to be
mutual, BE PATIENT.  If most of the women who attract you are uptight about
sex (and most women are), keep your caresses to what you would see in a
G-rated movie, and wait for her to suggest going further.  Give her time to
relax.   Don't ""cajole"" her.  If you are not able to do that, at least try
to find out what she wants instead of concentrating on what you want,
consider what to do about a baby if there was one, and discuss this with her.
Also, don't assume that birth-control is her problem.
    There are also women who have managed to overcome all their
inhibitions about sex or who never had any in the first place.
They are prepared to have one-night flings with no obligations
afterwards, and they change partners very quickly. This is a VERY small
minority. (I have only met one or two.) I don't know where to find
them or how to recognize them.  It is safe to assume that most women are
not like that.
    Many women will sleep with a man when they really don't want to.
They fairly frequently resent having done so afterward. Don't insist.
You may get bitched at after the fact.  I remember, a few years ago, a man
lost interest in me because I didn't want to sleep with him. I was very
disgusted that sex was the only thing about me that interested him.
Don't misunderstand; I enjoy sex, but, at that point, I wasn't ready for
sex with him, and I didn't want a relationship that consisted only of sex.
    I hope this is the sort of information you wanted.

attitudes toward sex in (new) relationships.
Your note got me to thinking about some of my perceptions about my
pursuit of happiness in everyday relationships with women.
In this enlightened age, there is much talk about equality and
(anti-)sexism.  And Feminism.  During some of my travels, I have
become confused, let me elaborate.
I do a lot of contra dancing.  Contra dancing is a form of folk
dancing native to New England, and is sort of like square dancing and
sort of like English country dancing.  Anyway, it's casual couple
dancing, and often, you go to a contra dance alone, and dance with a
different motos (member of the opposite sex) each dance.  Contra
dancing is simple and fun, I enjoy it quite a bit.
It seems that in this area of the country (Eastern Mass), most of the
women who go to contra dances do social work, most of the men are EE/CS
hackers named David.  This was told to me, I didn't make it up, but it
seems to be true.  Anyway, as a rule, the dancers are erudite and
informed, thoroughly modern, etc.  I explain all this as a matter of
background.  I would expect non-sexist attitudes to be the order of the
day.  Too bad it ain't so.
Even when there are an even number of men and women, or more women,
men ask women to dance much much more often than women ask men.  Even
worse, some women (usually the good dancers,) are competed for by the
men who chase women down to reserve dances later in the night.  I ask
one of these women for a dance and she says ""How about four dances
from now (or 2:15 a week from Thursday)?""  I usually refuse, for a
number of reasons. 
I would think that it would be pretty confusing for a woman to
remember who she promised which dance to, particularly when she
doesn't know the person involved.  (By the way, it is most common to
contra dance with people you've never met before.)  Also, this practice
keeps brand new male dancers from getting to dance with experienced
woman dancers.  A clumsy and perhaps shy male won't pursue one of these
women-with-lists for an appointment, out of fear of not living up to
the standards of all the dandies on her list.  The idea of being a man
on the list is degrading, not unlike the stereotypical woman in the
stud's little black book.  Also, a new male dancer is probably unaware
of the whole protocol of ""reserving"" dances, and would be taken aback
by it.  I've never seen a man with such a list.
Some men (who are used to this behavior, which is sort of regional
in contra dancing) just think that I'm just bitching about sour
grapes, and I am, but that doesn't mean that they aren't (sour).  What
annoys me is that it's the woman's choice to prepetuate this nonsense,
and these women who treat men in this demeaning way are women who
complain when they are treated in a demeaning way.  Consider the
situation I've just described with the roles reversed - men keeping
lists of women to dance with.  If it happened, women would complain,
but it doesn't happen, because of the pursuer/pursuee roles in our
culture.  You want to know who can change this active/passive crap?
Women can change it by being active.  It hasn't happened yet, because
most women are content in the passive pursued role.  I can't respect a
person who demands equal rights who won't meet me halfway.  These
attitudes won't be changed by the courts.  (They'll be changed in the
DANCE HALLS of this GREAT COUNTRY blah blah blah, I think I've made my
point ;-)

Being patient does not necessarily insure 
that a lady friend will ask you out.
I have read your article and simply cannot resist giving you a case example
in which I had an ol' fashion ""crush"" on a young lady while attending
Michigan University (let's hear it for the ol' Blue M). Now, I realize you
can ALWAYS claim that its easy to find acceptions to the general rule
but... the case example follows.
While attending U of M, I met a very quiet, shy, very attractive young lady
at a party. After talking to her for a while, we found out we were actually
neighbors in the same apartment building in Ann Arbor (that's how shy she
was... if I had never made the effort to talk to her, I might have graduated
without ever knowing she lived right next door to me!).
Never the less, she was fun to talk to and do stuff with once she felt
comfortable being with me... I'm not a very 
aggressive guy, that's not my nature. Anyway,
our friendship grew without the issue of whether or 
not we'd ever ""go out"" as boyfriend/girlfriend ever comming up...
By the end of school (1 year later) we had become the best of friends...
perhaps too good! We understood one another and accepted one another better
than any other woman I've ever known; and she admitted she felt the same
way about me several times.
The real clincher was this: when I FINALLY asked her if she'd like to 
go out she became totally cold to the idea claiming that she was afraid
that she'd lose me as a friend if the relationship didn't work out. I might
add that she had been involved in 3 or so relationships previously that
ended in disaster (I'm not sure whose fault it was - maybe it was a
combination of both people, or the exact cause of the
break-ups in all cases.) I do know that SLOW is the way she wanted her
relationships to go and all three guys wanted the relationships to get 
too serious, too fast.(That was HER reason as to why the relationships
never lasted.) Never the less, here was little ol' me, patient as could be,
the greatest of friends, waiting for her to realize that we'd probably make
a pretty durable pair (knowing each other's querks, etc..) but she never
took the initiative.
My point is this: I feel that some women have this notion that
relationships themselves are bad (not to mention feeling uneasy about sex)! 
This woman was so convinced that a relationship between me and her would 
permanently damage our friendship that she was unwilling to take 
a chance. How do you deal with someone who feels
this way? (Perhaps it was never meant to be?)
Incidently, we keep in touch with each other regularly. We're still the
closest of friends.  Unfortunately, we do not live close to one another 
anymore - she's attends law school in Atanta, Ga. & I work and live 
in good ol' N.J.
			Signed,
			Confused 
P.S. 
   Life goes on... By the way, I'm not seriously seeing anyone at this time so,
   if there are any young ladies out there who might be interested in meeting
   someone new drop me a line or send me mail!

almost everyone in the Ohio valley had antibodies to the fungus and the

4.  Its mode of transmission (using detective work and following patients

     ""the etiology of the underlying immune deficiencies seen in AIDS cases is
unknown.  One hypothesis consistent with current observations is that a trans-

most commonly to require intimate direct contact involving mucosal surfaces, such
as sexual contact among homosexual males, or through parenteral spread, such as
occurs among intravenous drug abusers and possible hemophilia patients using
Factor VIII products.  Airborne spread and interpersonal spread through casual
contact do not seem likely.  These patterns resemble the distribution of disease
and modes of spread of hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis B virus infectons
occur very frequently among aidDDDAIDS cases.

recent article in Time about sexually transmitted diseases. This article
said there was a period when casual sex was possible. VD was easily cured.
Then along came herpes. Now, for better or for worse, the choice of a
partner could not be so care-free. This article even alluded to a wrathful
God inflicting herpes as a punishment.
	Well, herpes may be painful and uncurable, but it is not fatal.
Now here is a disease which is. I wonder if AIDS will encourage monogamy
in cases where herpes hasn't. Apparently male homosexuals, who as a group
tend to change partners frequently, are often victims of AIDS.  I wonder
what Time thinks of this. And, I wonder what you think of this.
	Oh, and don't get any blood transfusions either.
