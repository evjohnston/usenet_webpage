        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Usenet Early Histories Project webpage! This site is a side project that grew out of my master's thesis about AIDS discourses on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" target="_blank">Bulletin Board System Usenet</a> in the early 1980s. Through my research, I found that analyses of early discussions on the platform were really hard to come by, both because the platform’s earlier years aren’t traditionally the focus of the academic literature that covers the platform, and because the archival data for Usenet, which is primarily accessible through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups" target="_blank">Google Groups</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/usenet" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> (and this <a href="https://usenetarchives.com/index.php?s=soc.motss&t=0&p=1" target="_blank">Usenet Archive</a> site, but it’s never really worked for me), was hard to gather in bulk for your own analysis, especially the farther back you go. Thus, this webpage was born!</p>

        <p>On this site, you’ll find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A brief overview of Usenet History</li>
            <li>A guide to my Python script and how I used it to get data on newsgroups (and how you can use it yourself)</li>
            <li>An overview of the newsgroups I’ve studied for my project and what the data I collected on them reveals</li>
        </ul>
